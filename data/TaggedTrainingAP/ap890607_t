 Embassies scrambled to evacuate their citizens from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Thursday, and hundreds of troop trucks roared into the capital to reinforce the military occupation after <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s turmoil spread to more than a dozen cities. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ordered embassy dependents to leave the country, one day after Chinese soldiers, saying they were looking for a sniper, sprayed a diplomatic compound with gunfire. Trucks, many piled high with supplies, rolled into central Tiananmen Square for more than an hour Thursday. Some carried troops with rifles aimed at people bicycling along the road. It was not immediately known whether these were the same troops, the <ORGANIZATION> 27th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, that left the city in two large convoys Wednesday. The 27th was responsible for killing and wounding thousands of people when it stormed the city Saturday to wrest control of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> from students demonstrating for democratic reforms. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence estimates put the death toll at 3,000. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> is also surrounded by armies said to oppose the harsh martial law crackdown, setting the stage for a possible battle between rival military factions. Reports surfaced of skirmishes between soldiers, but no serious clashes. Diplomats estimate 200,000 soldiers from 13 army groups have moved into the capital area. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> urged all Americans to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> at once, calling the situation `` volatile, uncertain and increasingly dangerous.'' It ordered the evacuation of 258 diplomatic dependents. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> chartered commercial planes to supplement regular <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline departures from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and officials organized transportation to help <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens get to airports, department spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. At <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> Thursday morning, about 10,000 troops stood in formation, did drills or jogged around the 100-acre square. About 40 tanks were lined up on the north end with guns pointing in all directions. An additional 20 tanks and armored personnel carriers were at the south end of the square. There were no signs of anti-aircraft weapons. The situation in the provinces was deteriorating. Increasingly violent demonstrations protested the weekend military invasion of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. State television broadcast a statement from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that any members found to have `` plotted, organized and led the rebellion'' would be expelled and punished severely. The warning mentioned no names, but conservative party leaders who ordered the crackdown were said to have singled out party chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> as the instigator and ordered his ouster. Another government announcement said soldiers were authorized to `` forcibly dispose of, on the spot'' anyone who resisted arrest. Several citizens were reported killed Wednesday. In the provinces, crowds protesting the army's invasion of the capital barricaded major roads and railways in anticipation of military assaults. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> foreign minister, declared in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was `` on the verge of civil war'' and the French Embassy staff would be reduced `` to the indispensable minimum.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to stop arms sales and military contacts in protest of the bloody crackdown was a `` detriment to bilateral relations.'' Many other nations also imposed sanctions or froze relations. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> condemned the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for giving refuge to dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, who fled to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. It accused <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> of attacking the communist system and said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was interfering in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. Chinese informants reported seeing the bodies of three people killed by soldiers and said seven people were killed or wounded near the railway station when a convoy of thousands of troops sped toward the eastern suburbs Wednesday morning. While no major fighting has materialized between the <ORGANIZATION> 27th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and supposedly rival military units on the edges of the city, a witness said the 27th and 38th armies, based in <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> respectively, fought each other with automatic weapons early Wednesday about 12 miles east of downtown. The witness believed two bystanders were killed but was not sure about military casualties. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said there were some clashes between small army units. State television showed Chinese reporters Wednesday on a tour of garbage-strewn Tiananmen Square. Soldiers appeared to be sparsely deployed and tanks could be seen on the side near the imperial palace. `` Not one person died on the square,'' a martial law official said. Witnesses and students driven from the square after a three-week protest said hundreds were shot down or crushed by tanks during the invasion early Sunday. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top leaders have not appeared since the crackdown began and official media report little about the violence. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xioaping </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader who has been reported in ill health `` is still alive ... and still running the show.'' In other cities: _ Six people were run over by a train while manning a barricade near the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> railway station Tuesday night <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> radio said angry crowds set the train ablaze and beat 21 railway security officials who tried to put the fire out. _ Tens of thousands of people in <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION> blocked roads and held anti-government demonstrations <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION> radio said the unrest `` wrecked the city's life.'' _ In <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, provincial radio said 100 people were arrested after a `` gang of scoundrels'' stormed city offices and beat up 300 security officials on Sunday The radio did not comment on unconfirmed reports that 20 people died killed in clashes with security forces. _ The <LOCATION> Heilongjiang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Daily </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION>, northeastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, said roadblocks severely affected public transport and the situation was `` extremely serious. _ Also in the northeast, the mayor of <LOCATION> Changchun </LOCATION> said people blocked factory gates and `` if this situation continues, the city's economy will be paralyzed Embassies arranging flights for nationals included those of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> press spokesman <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Koss </PERSON> said 125 embassy dependents would leave on a special commercial flight Thursday and 73 dependents from four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulates leave as soon as possible. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said fewer than 1,000 Americans remained in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Evacuation efforts gained urgency after soldiers fired on a diplomatic compound, then surrounded it in what they said was a search for a sniper who killed one soldier and wounded three. Security officials took a Chinese man away. Public transportation remained suspended in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and shoppers formed long lines to buy scarce, expensive vegetables and meat. National television said postal service and milk delivery would resume Thursday.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday told visiting Pakistani Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is willing `` to explore any serious avenue'' to achieve a political solution in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> in turn said after private talks with the president that `` we are in complete accord'' on the situation in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, stalemated since the pullout of the last Soviet troops in February. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the withdrawal of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> proved the effectiveness of <LOCATION> U.S-Pakistani </LOCATION> support for the Afghan resistance fighting the Marxist regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> shares a common border with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` We agreed, however, that the job is not done,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> continues and their struggle for self-determination goes on.'' `` Prime Minister <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and I discussed ways to encourage a political solution in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> that will lead to a non-aligned, representative government willing to live in peace with its neighbors, to replace the illegitimate regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will continue to explore any serious avenue towards this end.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had anticipated a rapid demise for the government of <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> after the Soviet pullout, but it has not happened. Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said she and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` have reviewed the situation in the light of the prevailing circumstances and we are in complete accord'' on what needs to be done. `` <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> remains committed to a political solution of the Afghan problem, whereby the brave people of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will have the right to freely choose their own government without interference from outside,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, the daughter of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, said that while the Soviet pullout `` has brought a welcome change in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the continued fighting and prolonged presence of over 3.5 million Afghan refugees pose serious threats to the peace and stability of the region.'' After a full-dress military ceremony on the White House lawn, including a 19-gun salute, and an Oval Office meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> went to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for a meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and a lunch in her honor. At a state dinner Tuesday evening, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joked during the exchange of toasts that Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> had `` refused my latest offer. She's not going double or nothing on this year's Harvard-Yale game.'' Keeping up the Ivy League banter, Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> responded: `` Ladies and gentlemen, I studied at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and believe me, I did n't know until tonight that <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> ever produced charming men. I'm glad I met the only one.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> is a 1973 <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> graduate; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a 1948 graduate of arch-rival <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has a standing request to buy 60 more F-16 fighter jets from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed aside reporters' attempts to ask about reports that approval of the jet sale is imminent. An administration official, briefing reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> discussed the F-16 sale, but `` I would n't anticipate any specific announcement from outside'' during her visit. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, indicated there were no stumbling blocks to the sale, but normal steps such as congressional notification would take more time. On another topic, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> `` assured me that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s nuclear program is committed to peaceful purposes.'' He said he underlined his commitment `` to discourage proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons, ballistic missiles, in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> region and around the world.'' In an interview with editors of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said she had `` very frank talk'' with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, and assured them <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> does not intend to build nuclear weapons. She said she wanted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to help <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> reach a nuclear test-ban treay with `` other countries in the region,'' an apparent reference to long-ti8me rival <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, according to a report on the interview in Wednesday editions. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> exploded what it called a nuclear `` device'' in 1974. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> last month said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> `` clearly'' was developing nuclear capability and Indian appeared interested in developing thermonculear weapons. The two leaders also discussed efforts to combat drug production and trafficking. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he `` applauded her tough stance on eradicating the opium cultivation'' and thanked her for extraditing an alleged drug trafficker. The two countries were expected to sign agreements on housing, narcotics and education this week during <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s stay. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the third largest recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid, is slated for $ 380 million in economic assistance and $ 240 million in military aid next year. Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father was deposed by Gen. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> in 1977 and hanged two years later for a political murder. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> remained in power until perishing in a mysterious plane crash last year that also claimed the life of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> and an American general. Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who had picked up her father's fallen standard and been jailed for a time under <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, led her <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to victory as head of a coalition government last November. Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was scheduled to address a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. She also had stops here at the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. She will receive an honorary degree at her alma mater, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, on Thursday and visit the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. She departs for home Saturday evening.

 Network audiences are doing their summer tune-out as the prime-time schedule fills up with reruns. For the week ending June 4, the three networks had a combined audience share of 59, the lowest since last September when it dipped to 58. The only shows that are n't in reruns are news programs and the occasional pilot that did n't make it to series. But <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> got a surprising reaction to `` <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>'s Deal,'' which landed in the top 10 in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings last week. The two-hour pilot, about a former corporate lawyer who lost it all because of a gambling problem, was written by independent filmmaker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayles </PERSON> -LRB- `` Eight Men Out'' -RRB- and aired as <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s Sunday movie. `` <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>'s Deal'' had a 14.5 rating and 25 share and ranked 10th, in a tie with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` 60 Minutes.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had been saying there were no plans to take the pilot to series, although <PERSON> Sayles </PERSON> has written two more episodes. After the ratings came in, the network said it was considering keeping the show around. `` <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>'s Deal'' dealt a poor hand to its competition on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` The Tony Awards,'' honoring the year's finest on Broadway. It had its lowest rating ever, a 9.3 and 16 share. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the week, its 50th in a row, with an average prime-time rating of 12.7. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> came in second with a 9.6. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had a 9.4. Each rating point equals 904,000 households with television. The share is a percentage of sets in use. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne'' was the top-rated show of the week, followed by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers,'' `` The Cosby Show,'' `` A Different World'' and `` Dear <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Wonder Years,'' CBS' `` Murder, She Wrote,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Have Faith'' and `` Who's the Boss?'' then `` <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>'s Deal and `` 60 Minutes.'' `` ABC World News Tonight'' was first in last week's news race with an 8.9 rating and 20 share. The `` CBS Evening News'' had an 8.4 and 19 share. `` NBC Nightly News'' had a 7.7 and 18.

 Governments around the world tried to evacuate their citizens from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Tuesday as an outpouring of protest and condemnation of the bloodshed in the Chinese capital continued. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> joined the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in banning military sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ the toughest measures announced by the many countries protesting <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s military crackdown on demonstrators that left hundreds of people dead. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> froze political relations, barring contacts involving Chinese government officials. The Dutch government summoned Chinese Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ping </PERSON> and told him <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> `` is exceptionally shocked by the violent and brutal actions of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> also delivered a firm message to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> ambassador in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and the orchestra of <ORGANIZATION> Vienna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> scheduled a commemorative concert for the Chinese victims. Dutch government officials canceled a state visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by Queen <PERSON> Beatrix </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said a November visit by <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> `` can not take place as long as those responsible for the atrocities ... remain in control of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government.'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will not allow mass immigration from the colony of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, due to be handed over to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1997. He said an open door policy `` could more than double the ethnic minority population of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said earlier that about 3.5 million <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> eligible for British passports will not be given the right of residence in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> but <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will show `` greater flexibility'' about immigration from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. She expressed `` utter revulsion'' at the Chinese crackdown and said, `` We will be thinking how best to demonstrate that in practical ways.'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> announced <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> immediately is banning arms sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> due to the `` slaughter of innocent people'' and banned military contacts and visits by senior <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> refused to say what arms <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> sells to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but the <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> said sales amounted to $ 4.68 million a year. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> sells <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> more than $ 600 million of military equipment a year, and private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dealers do about $ 85 million worth of military sales with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Godet </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, said the ban marks the first time <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> has withdrawn approval from contracts already agreed. he declined to say how much the contracts are worth, but sources said they amounted to a few million dollars. Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said his government is not considering economic sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Taizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said that because of the situation aid projects `` can not go on.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the largest contributor of aid to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the assistance, most in the form of loans, totaled $ 6.1 billion as of 1987, the latest figures available. The 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> strongly condemned the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> action and appealed to authorities to stop using force. But it did not propose any joint protest measures. People in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> copied a protest started in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> on Monday by withdrawing deposits from <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> branches. A crowd formed outside the bank, where a senior official said three to four times more people than usual withdrew money. He said he did not know how much was withdrawn. Meanwhile, many governments warned their citizens in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to leave the country or take strict security precautions as reports spread of Chinese soldiers battling each other in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> urged the 1,440 Americans in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to leave and planned arrangements for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to fly them to safety. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> chartered a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 to evacuate Britons to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. About 50 Canadians, heeding advice from <LOCATION> Ottowa </LOCATION> to leave immediately, flew out Tuesday, and 200 more were to leave on a special flight Wednesday, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said. The Australian government chartered a jumbo jet to evacuate its citizens and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gareth </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said the increasing violence indicates `` the larger potential for really full-scale civil war erupting.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> arranged for two special commercial flights to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Tuesday to help its citizens leave and <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said further flights were planned, pending permission from <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> also hired jets for evacuations. <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Occetto </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, urged the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to take a strong stance against the massacre and distanced his party from the leaders responsible for the crackdown. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> has the largest communist party in the West. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> called on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders to use `` wisdom, reason and a weighted approach'' but did not denounce the violence. The Soviet Foreign Ministry has made no comment. The two communist giants are trying to mend fences after decades of estrangement. Protesters, mainly Chinese students, demonstrated outside <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> embassies in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>; the Hague in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Greeceother </LOCATION> and other cities. In <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the pro-government newspaper The Citizen questioned why <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is the target of international boycotts `` when whatever faults we have are tiny by comparison ... to the horror of the massacre of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.'' East German state newspapers indirectly took sides with the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government's use of force. The <ORGANIZATION> Junge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> newspaper appealed to East Germans not to believe media reports that bore the `` viewpoint of Western politics'' and gave `` good grades to those holding out in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> to protest the government, and bad grades to those calling for calm and reconciliation.''

 <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has emerged from the long shadow of his father and appears to be making a bid for power himself, a move some analysts believe is doomed to fail. He was making his moves even before <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> died Saturday. But the death of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary and spiritual patriarch, before the leadership issue could be settled, has added urgency to the son's campaign. `` A lot of emotions are rampant in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> now,'' <PERSON> Shahram </PERSON> <PERSON> Chubin </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview. `` Some people will be trying to take advantage of that and <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> is one of them.'' The Assembly of Experts, the body formed in 1979 to ensure a smooth transition after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death, on Sunday named President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> as a caretaker leader until the succession is resolved. In the meantime, rivals in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> are jockeying for power. Although <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> is only a middle-ranking cleric, or hojatoleslam, and holds no official title, he was one of his father's closest advisers. As <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s private secretary, he controlled access to the reclusive patriarch and wielded considerable influence behind the scenes. The younger <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, 43, took an increasingly high public profile as his father's health declined. He has allied himself with radical figures in the hierarchy in the power struggle that has intensified since the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Speculation rose that he sought to establish himself as his father's political heir by engineering the March 28 dismissal of his father's designated successor, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein-Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> was his father's eyes and ears since their days in exile and through the Islamic revolution that toppled the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>. Last month, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> newspapers published lengthy excerpts of a 110-page memorandum <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>, lashing him for seeking to undermine <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s regime and consorting with opposition groups. The document appeared to be aimed at publicly projecting <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> as a candidate to inherit his father's mantle. <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajavi </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, or People's Holy Warriors, the main Iranian opposition movement, says <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> was grooming <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> as his successor. <PERSON> Rajavi </PERSON> said in a statement that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s dismissal of <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> for criticizing the regime `` prepared the ground for this appointment.'' He argued that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s appointment of a special committee to amend the constitution, including downgrading the religious qualifications of his successor from `` divinely inspired authority'' was aimed at making room for <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>. But analysts believe the black-bearded <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> could eventually become a political casualty now that his father is dead. They believe that bereft of the ayatollah's authority, and with no secure power base of his own, <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>'s influence could evaporate. `` As <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s health deteriorated, he was able to control his father's statements and this gave him some authority,'' <PERSON> Chubin </PERSON> said. `` But it would be rather difficult for him to be the keeper of the flame now that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has gone. <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> has neither the religious credentials nor the administrative experience to rule and it's not clear whether claiming dynastic credentials will be enough. `` He could become a pawn in the power struggle, a front man for more powerful people following his father's death.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> specialist <PERSON> Shireen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview: `` I do n't think he'll emerge as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s strongman. `` His power is really quite vicarious, stemming primarily from his position as his father's gatekeeper. I do n't believe he can fill his father's shoes.'' With 40 days of mourning declared for <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has been engulfed by a wave of emotion for its dead leader, a development <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> could exploit to advance his political ambitions. But Ms. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> cautioned: `` Using <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s name could be a double-edged sword. There was already a backlash against <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and that in the end could work against <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>. The revolution is against dynasties. `` He could well become a major player ... but he's not a person of great convictions and he'll have to associate himself with one group or another to stay in play.'' From the outside, the political maneuverings in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> are often opaque. But last August, <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> was seen as a member of an unofficial troika with <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, both so-called `` pragmatists,'' who had effectively taken over day-to-day control as <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s health failed. Now he's aligned with the radicals led by Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, Prosecutor-General <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> <PERSON> Khoeiniha </PERSON>, Intelligence Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Rey-Shahri </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Tavasoli </PERSON>, a powerful behind-the-scenes figure in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. Some analysts believe <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> could swing back to <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> again if he sees him gaining ground. But for now he's lined up against <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who was earlier outflanked by the radicals in the fundamentalist resurgence decreed by his father in February. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s shrewdest politicians, appears to be maneuvering his way back and could well come out on top again, as he has done many times before. There is speculation <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> will run in presidential elections scheduled for Aug. 18. So far the only announced candidate is the formidable <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who won the highest ballot in last year's parliamentary elections with more than 1.3 million votes.

<HEAD>Authorities Predict More Widespread AIDS Testing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health official says the time is coming when doctors will report the names of people testing positive for the AIDS virus and try to trace victims' sexual contacts. But activists criticized the proposal. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary for Health, said he did n't know when such a system would be in place, but when it happens `` we will have normalized HIV and will handle it like syphilis.'' HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s remarks Tuesday at the Fifth International Conference on AIDS drew immediate criticism. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON>, executive director of the Gay Men's Health Crisis in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, opposed the proposal because he feared names would not be kept confidential and that people known to be infected would suffer from the stigma associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. `` People lose their jobs, their housing and their schooling opportunities,'' he said. `` That's not like other diseases.'' Furthermore, he said, tracing patients' sexual contacts will not work for AIDS as it does with syphilis because HIV patients may have been infected for years when they are diagnosed. Tracing partners so far back is unlikely, he said. The consequences of reporting would discourage many people from submitting to testing, <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> said. `` The only way people are going to come forward is if there's something effective'' to help them, he said. The Gay Men's Health Crisis received numerous calls Tuesday from people who were already concerned that their names might be recorded if they seek testing. Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> health commissioner, floated a similar proposal at the AIDS meeting Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has directed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to prepare a report on discrimination against people with AIDS and HIV infection, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said, in anticipation of moves toward reporting the names of those tested. He said early identification of infected people through contact tracing could allow them to be treated promptly with new drugs now being tested. The cost of such treatment would run into the billions of dollars, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. He did not know where that money might come from. In other conference reports: _ Researchers said initial studies on a new AIDS drug called CD4 showed that the medicine is safe and may reduce levels of HIV in the body. The drug is a decoy intended to confuse the virus and draw it away from the blood cells it ordinarily infects. In expeimental use on 18 people, Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarchoan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> found that the drug appeared to lower virus levels in the body by about 50 percent. However, he cautioned that this could have been a natural fluctuation instead of a result of the drug. Another team found no clear evidence of virus reduction, but researchers said they were still encouraged by the drug's potential and said higher doses could have a greater effect. _ In a report scheduled for presentation today, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> reserachers said a recently discovered herpes virus may accelerate the development of AIDS in people infected with HIV Dr. <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lusso </PERSON> said the virus, called HHV-6, enhanced the growth of HIV in test tube, causing more cells to die more quickly. More than half of Americans, Canadians and Europeans have been exposed to HHV-6 without any ill effects and may be capable of passing it on, studies have shown. _ Researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> said it was now possible to predict two years in advance which patients infected with HIV will develop AIDS Studies suggest that a majority of people infected with the virus get AIDS or related illnesses. A similar study by researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, found that a combination of five laboratory tests can predict which patients will develop AIDS during a four-year period.

 Thousands of the troops responsible for the bloody crackdown on the pro-democracy movement fanned out from the city center Wednesday, spraying gunfire as they passed Chinese and diplomatic residential areas. They appeared to be taking up positions for an attack, possibly from rival military factions which had moved into the city's outskirts Most of the troops from the <ORGANIZATION> 27th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, in a convoy of hundreds of trucks and support vehicles, appeared to be shooting into the air, although some aimed at an apartment complex where hundreds of diplomats and other foreigners live. Several dozen bullets hit the windows of apartments facing the main street. There were no reports of injuries. At a nearby intersection, troops took up defensive positions behind barricades and trees as if expecting an attack. Troops were also seen reinforcing positions at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Railway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> to the east of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and at the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> northeast of the square. The 27th drove unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators from the center of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on early Sunday, killing hundreds in the most violent suppression of a popular movement in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 40-year history Troops from the 28th and 38th armies and soldiers from northeastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have moved into the city, raising fears of a battle. The 27th Army is closely linked to President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> hardliners. The 28th Army is believed to back <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, a moderate who challenged the conservatives and was stripped of his post as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader. The 38th Army, which is based around <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, reportedly refused orders to open fire on civilians and opposed the martial law crackdown. There have been several skirmishes between rival military groups, but no major clashes. An unidentified general appeared on national television Tuesday night and denied factional divisions in the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement condemning the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for what it called its `` short-sighted'' policies toward <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, joining other Western countries imposing sanctions on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, has suspended arms sales and other military contacts to protest the violent suppression of the pro-democracy movement. The ministry, in a statement read on television, insisted the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is stable and there has been no change in the nation's foreign policy. About 3,000 foot soldiers carrying rifles left <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in two waves Wednesday. The first group of about 1,000 had packs on their backs and marched 20 abreast. They were accompanied by a tank and two armored personnel carriers. Some 400 split soon from the main group and turned toward the south. Some in the second group were in plain clothes. The troops chanted, `` Down with corruption, we love the people, we love the capital, we love youth, long live the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'' as they left their positions in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. People along the sidewalks initially cheered when they heard the chanting. But one office worker said, `` They can sing any slogan they want but then they start shooting.'' An undetermined number of troops and tanks remained in the square. Another group of 600 foot soldiers wearing red armbands was seen advancing toward the square from the west. They appeared to be preparing to take over traffic control. Thousands of foreigners are trying frantically to leave <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> has told all Americans to leave as soon as possible and the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> has told the 3,000 Japanese in the city to prepare for immediate evacuation. Many nations were arranging for special planes to transport their nationals out of the country. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Shi </PERSON>, one of five members of the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, received a telegram from the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> supporting the crackdown. The report, read on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> radio, was significant because the telegram was sent to <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON> and not <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> has not been seen publicly since May 19, officials have not confirmed he has lost his post. Diplomats have often considered <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON>, 64, a top candidate to replace <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. But a Chinese source said Wednesday that a family member said <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON> had not been appointed party chief. <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON> generally is viewed as the party's law-and-order chief. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> radio also reported that conservative Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> attended a meeting Tuesday to hear reports on industrial production. A <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> newspaper reported that <PERSON> Li </PERSON> was shot in the thigh by a young guard officer but his wounds were not serious. The reports were the first official indications of leadership positions since Saturday's assault. The leadership, including senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, has not made any public appearances since the crackdown. A report that <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> had died added to the chaos. The report, from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, was denied by the government. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration said it appeared likely that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leaders had left <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Soldiers continued firing into crowds around <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Tuesday and early Wednesday. Witnesses said a small boy was killed and a girl wounded in the head Tuesday. Anti-government demonstrations spread to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nanjing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shenyang </LOCATION> and other cities. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most famous dissident, astrophysicist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, took refuge in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. He had told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> last week he was concerned conservatives might arrest him. Government spokesman <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON> said on television 300 people were killed in Saturday's crackdown, including 23 students; and 7,000 were injured and 400 soldiers were missing. The evening TV news said 32 people were arrested, most of them for trying to set fire to public buses. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence reports reaching <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> indicate 3,000 people probably were killed, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Tuesday. On Tuesday afternoon, witnesses said the <ORGANIZATION> 27th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> fought with soldiers from <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> province's 28th Army, believed loyal to <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. There were no reports of casualties. The brief exchange, including several rounds from a tank cannon, occurred just south of the <LOCATION> Military </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. It followed unconfirmed reports of soldiers fighting soldiers in the western and southeastern parts of the city. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is organized into about 22 Group Armies. Each has about three divisions and totals about 40,000 soldiers. Hundreds of citizens flocked to the bridge at <LOCATION> Muxudi </LOCATION>, also in the west, to welcome soldiers Tuesday evening who said they were from the 38th Army. `` Exterminate the 27th Army! Avenge blood with blood!'' people in the crowd chanted as they handed buns, eggs and cigarettes to the troopers. `` People, do not be afraid!'' said a voice from a loudspeaker carried by the soldiers. `` The 38th Army will not kill the people.''

 Third-place <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> plans to become the network of the 1990s with more sports coverage and innovative programming, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> broadcast group told affiliates. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON>'s comments Tuesday were enthusiastically received by broadcasters attending the network's annual affiliates meeting. The mood was in contrast to the skepticism at last year's meeting, which followed the network's first-ever third-place finish in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> prime-time ratings behind <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Referring to praise for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s news coverage of the weekend massacre in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON> said: `` It gives me great pleasure to see my old friend <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> become the talk of the town again. When people ask what <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> is going to get for $ 3 billion, this is an example.'' <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> is president of CBS. The broadcasters also heard from Rather and <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>, who talked by audio hookup to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and by television satellite to White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> defended President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s cautious reaction to events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We're pushing as hard as we can, but we ca n't push beyond the point of constructive interaction,'' he said. `` We do not want to give anyone cause to feel we are intervening or instigating bloodshed.''

<HEAD>Political Blood Lust Still in Evidence on Republican Right</HEAD>

 When the House Republican leader warned his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> colleagues against a French Revolution mentality in which `` evil Democrats'' are hauled to the guillotine, some began humming the French national anthem. The incident at a party meeting Tuesday illustrates the political blood lust that persists in a chamber fractured by months of ethics charges and countercharges, and the uphill fight new House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> will have in trying to restore order. `` The task I see for myself is to create the environment where ... debate can take place without recriminations, without the kind of angry, hostile feelings between members'' that have dominated the House of late, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> told reporters. `` This tension which has built up over a period of many months is going to require a little time to turn around,'' he said. `` It's not going to be done in a day. ... But I believe it will happen.'' Some Democrats, stung by the sacrifice of former speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in the ethics storm, have turned their sights on Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., who filed the original ethics charges against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> An ethics investigation of <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s book-promotion deal could begin as early as Thursday. Of the ethics committee and <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Slaughter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said: `` I want them to treat him fairly, but I certainly want them to treat him.'' The political knives remained out in the Republican camp, as well. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> political operatives were searching financial disclosure reports for possible ethical shortcomings of Democrats, and <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> spoke of new ethics cases yet to be filed against members of the majority party. Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, who warned his colleagues against a frenzy of political executions, blamed the atmosphere on `` 35 years of uninterrupted power'' for Democrats and said ethics abuses wo n't be forgotten. `` I am all for putting an end to bitterness,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said. `` I am all in favor of putting our House in order, but we wo n't do so by sweeping things under the rug.'' In an acceptance speech to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> directed many of his comments at the Republican side, promising increased consultation and appealing to shared values of trust and public service. The calming style was in sharp contrast to that of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Where <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> confronted, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> counsels; where <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> followed his own compass, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> seeks advice. Republicans will now be looking for that style to be translated into changes that will benefit them. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> may be able to buy some peace by permitting more Republican amendments to be offered to bills on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, or by bringing legislation before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> under less restrictive rules. `` If he does, I'll be totally and cheerfully bipartisan,'' said <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s chief gadfly. But he doubted that <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> would be able to give the Republicans much latitude on issues they want most, such as a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and the death penalty for drug and other offenses. `` Those are anathema to the left wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. While he appealed for cooperation, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> did not seek to hide his own ideology. He openly acknowledged at a news conference that he is a liberal, the label that Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sought vainly to avoid last year. And he clearly reserved the sole right to set the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s agenda, the prerogative of the majority. `` Procedurally, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> will try to work with the Republicans to be fair,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` I think the difference will be he will be a fighter on issues the Democrats stand for.

<TEXT>
 With President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowing that the `` scourge'' of drugs will stop and drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> organizing the troops for a full-scale war, calls for decriminalization of drug use are like cries in the dark. But the cries are getting louder and have drawn together people from disparate sides of the political spectrum _ from conservative <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON>, a former prosecutor. Advocates of such a stance point to a drop in crime rates following the 1933 end of Prohibition that had outlawed liquor sales since 1920. Today, huge drug profits and artificially high drug prices are fueling the violent crime plaguing cities throughout the country, they say. Removing the profits would remove the criminals, the argument goes, and the billions of dollars now spent on unsuccessful enforcement efforts could be funneled into treatment and education programs. But the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration maintains the need for `` zero tolerance'' of illicit drug use, and fighting the war on drugs _ even if it requires scarce federal financial resources _ is a priority on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. In March, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told one group of high school students that legalizing drugs would be `` 180 degrees wrong.'' A recent forum featuring advocates of decriminalization _ organized by the libertarian-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Cato </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and featuring presentations by <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Ethan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadelmann </PERSON> and attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostrowksi </PERSON> _ drew attendees from <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s Office of National Drug Control Policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The three who spoke to the forum emphasized that they were n't advocating use of now-illicit drugs `` The available evidence indicates that legalization would not lead to an explosion in drug use. The repeal of alcohol prohibition did not,'' said <PERSON> Ostrowski </PERSON>. `` The decriminalization of marijuana in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> did not. The cheap and ready access to cocaine and narcotics in the 19th century did not. `` The fact is, most people in our society are capable of acting responsibly when it comes to drugs,'' he said. `` Users of nicotine are declining. Alcohol abusers are only a small percentage of the population.'' The panel members differed, however, on how much decriminalization they want. <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> stressed that although he believes marijuana use and sales should not have criminal penalties, he was not advocating that sales of cocaine, heroin and other dangerous drugs be allowed in the same manner that alcoholic beverages are now sold. `` The model that I think makes the most sense is the model in <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, in which the government treats addicts as patients and says that you can obtain these substances from certified health professionals,'' <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> said. `` But if you obtain these substances outside the public health system, you're subject to criminal sanctions.'' Such a plan lowers the crime rate, because `` you do n't have to rob and steal and break into people's houses to obtain enough goods to buy drugs,'' and it restricts the spread of AIDS that otherwise would be transmitted through the sharing of needles, he said. <PERSON> Nadelmann </PERSON> said that from a strict cost-benefit analysis _ including money spent for enforcement of drug laws as well as the cost of violence, corruption and the need for ever-expanding prisons _ the prohibition on drugs makes no sense. He acknowledged that while the illegality of some drugs may make some people, particularly those in higher socioeconomic groups, stay away from the substances, the nation ca n't ignore the violence plaguing inner cities, much of it caused by the illegality of the drug-dealers' trade. Ever-increasing spending on unsuccessful enforcement makes no sense, <PERSON> Nadelmann </PERSON> argued. `` Everything we've been doing in the past or that we're talking about doing now and that people are talking about doing in the future in terms of criminal justice approaches is doomed to failure,'' he said. `` Twenty years of experience has shown that. `` And it has nothing to do with corruption in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> or turf squabbles between law enforcement agencies or with whether or not we have a drug czar or whether or not his name is <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Nadelmann </PERSON> said. `` What it has to do with is the nature of the market, the nature of the commodity and how lucrative the whole thing is.'' It's impossible to wipe out all the opium fields in the world, he said, and it's impossible to intercept all the cocaine imported to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> without virtually closing down foreign trade and sealing the borders. Former Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> said after the forum that he remained undecided on the issue. `` I think the strongest argument is getting the criminal element out of the drug business,'' said <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 1972 and is now on the lecture circuit. But <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said he doubted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is ready to hear the decriminalization arguments. `` Maybe five to 10 years down the road, you'll be getting more serious evaluation of this side of the argument,'' he said.

<HEAD>Questions Raised About Company's Subsidies, Ties to Fugitive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is reviewing a grain company's possible links to a fugitive commodities trader in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and its receipt of at least $ 65 million in government export subsidies. At issue are the company's ties to <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, who fled to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> in 1983 before his indictment for criminal tax evasion, racketeering, mail and wire fraud. A department official confirmed Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> was examining <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a Swiss-based company with an office in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and payments it received through the Export Enhancement Program, known as EEP. The review was started at the request of the chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., who raised questions about the company at a hearing earlier this year and on Tuesday asked the agency for a full investigation <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, in a letter to the agency, said `` an unmistakable line of ownership, control and profit runs from'' <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> through a series of subsidiary arrangements. `` While I am disturbed that a company whose main operations lie outside of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can establish but a nominal onshore presence and qualify to receive <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> bonuses, as appears to be the case with <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION>, I am truly shocked that a fugitive from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> justice can benefit from a program funded by taxpayer dollars,'' <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> said in his letter to Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. Under the Export Enhancement Program, private exporters can sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities at lower prices to meet foreign competition and then collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON>, under secretary for international affairs and commodity programs, said <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> had started `` checking through what the connections are'' between <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>. He declined to provide any details on the findings so far. An official of <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Church </PERSON>, declined to comment about the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> review and would not provide any information about the company. <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> asked that <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Inspector General determine whether <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> qualified for the export subsidy program and whether department eligibility guidelines need to be changed to close any possible loopholes used by <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> has the same telephone number as <ORGANIZATION> Clarendon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Marc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. A.G. of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> <PERSON> Clarendon </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> company settled a federal tax evasion case in 1984 by pleading guilty and agreeing to pay more than $ 200 million in back taxes, fines and other penalties. Criminal charges against <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> were unaffected by the settlement. The government alleged that <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> and his commodity-trading empire cheated the government out of millions of dollars in taxes through a series of illegal oil transactions among Rich-controlled companies. <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> has received at least $ 65 million worth of subsidies through <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, ranking it ninth among grain exporters in the program, according to information supplied to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>. Most recently, <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> picked up estimated subsidies of $ 250,000 for a wheat sale to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Last month, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> approved use of the subsidy program for the sale of 1.5 million tons of wheat to the Soviets. <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> handled at least 30,000 tons of the initial part of the wheat deal. Subsidies averaged $ 8.46 per ton for <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> and four other companies, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, who met Tuesday with <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> might need to pass legislation disqualifying <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> from the export program unless <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> administratively barred it from receiving more subsidies. `` The export enhancement program has undergone some criticism anyway.

 While several police organizations are urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve strict controls on semiautomatic assault-style weapons, some 225 officers gathered on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to say those groups do n't speak for them. `` The average policeman in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> right now is extremely upset with the misrepresentations,'' said Patrolman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aveni </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who asked that his department be identified only as being in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The notion that policemen favor `` gun bans as a solution to violent crime'' is wrong, said <PERSON> Aveni </PERSON>, who recently organized a group called Law Enforcement for the Preservation of the Second Amendment, which guarantees the right to keep and bear arms. `` The majority of us have taken an oath to uphold the Constitution,'' he said in an interview. `` The Second Amendment's the cornerstone of the Constitution If the Second Amendment goes, there's no guarantee that the rest of the Constitution will remain intact. ... Without arms, people are powerless to dissent against any kind of tyranny or repression of government.'' <PERSON> Aveni </PERSON> was one of the 225 officers flown to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to participate in a news conference Tuesday and lobby their respective congressmen and senators. The only state not represented by an officer was <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. They were here to combat the impact of gun-control endorsements by law enforcement officials such as <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Behan </PERSON>, who are pushing for controls on assault-style weapons including semiautomatic versions of the AK-47 and Uzi. Law enforcement groups that have taken similar stands include the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> and the Police Executive Research Forum. `` For thousands of us out there that the chiefs, the appointed officials, do not speak for the law enforcement officers that are in the field, in the trenches, doing the job,'' said <PERSON> Patrolman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Maples </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, countered that his organization speaks for 200,000 of those officers, not for their bosses. `` The Fraternal Order of Police does speak for the cop on the street,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` There are no chiefs, there are no sheriffs. They do n't speak for anyone except for the cops on the beat.'' The contention by some law enforcement leaders that their officers are being `` outgunned'' by criminals wielding assault-style weapons `` offends me,'' Officer <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyle </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said at the news conference. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, Officer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON> said criminals have better firearms because they're making more money these days. `` Unfortunately, police departments have for many years been forced to look at the bottom line in terms of low bid, and that applies to our safety equipment in particular,'' <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> Police Lt. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said many of the officers attending were `` under direct orders from their police chiefs to disassociate themselves from their respective police departments'' in their comments. `` The remarks that are made here should not be construed as the official policy of our respective police departments,'' he said.

<HEAD>Two Reports Give Differing Views of Airline Hubs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The domination of an airport by a single airline is either a blow or a boon to competition and low fares, depending on whose report you believe. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, in a study released today, says air fares average 27 percent more per passenger mile at 15 major hub airports than fares at non-hubs. It said competition has decreased on many routes. The airline industry's <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, in a 60-airport study made public Tuesday, said competition is up and average fares at two-thirds of the nation's hub airports have decreased in the last four years. It says average fares at 30 hub airports are only 1.5 percent higher than at non-hubs. Direct comparisons between the two studies are not possible because they deal with different statistics, each putting its own slant on the controversy over the practice of major airlines of routing a large share of their flights through a single airport. Both studies agree, however, that fares generally have decreased since deregulation a decade ago and that the establishment of hub airports has brought greater efficiency to commercial aviation. Hubs enable airlines to consolidate maintenance and other operations at one or two airports. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on aviation today was looking into the effects of the hub system on passenger fares and competitition among the airlines. Both studies have been submitted to the subcommittee. The study by the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, which is the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, says fares for dominant airlines at 13 of the 15 hubs studied were higher than fares for other airlines serving the same airports. It also says fares for the airlines rose after they established the dominant position at the hub airports. Comparisons were made with 38 non-hub airports. In showing decreased competition, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report says that after a single airline gained dominance at an airport, the number of destinations served by four or more airlines fell 52 percent while the number served by only one carrier increased 25 percent. `` Hubbing generates important operating efficiencies, but it can also lead to substantial market power for the airlines, which could lead to higher fares and reduced levels of service,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> in testimony prepared for the subcommittee hearing. The industry study conducted by the aviation consulting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Simat </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helliesen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Eichner </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> ATA </ORGANIZATION> concludes that despite increased concentration within the industry and at some airports, competition in individual markets has increased. `` There is very little, if any, significant relationship between average fares and airline concentration at either hub or non-hub airports,'' the study says. `` The hub and spoke system has evolved into a highly competitive national transportation system which provides enormous benefits to the American public,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Aaronson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ATA </ORGANIZATION> president. The industry study says that higher levels of service, such as more non-stop flights, account for higher average fare levels at some hubs. But the association said passengers have the option of flying multi-stop flights or connecting flights at lower fares. The <ORGANIZATION> ATA </ORGANIZATION> said its study looked at airline schedules at 25 airports fed by hubs and found that they are now servied by an average of nearly twice as many airlines as in 1978, prior to deregulation of the industry.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Major airlines in April flew more on-time flights, lost less baggage and received fewer complaints, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly consumer report. Airlines reported the highest on-time rate in six months _ 83.4 percent, an 11 percent improvement over the previous month. Delays due to mechanical problems were not counted in the report released Tuesday. Passengers filed reports of lost baggage in April at the rate of 6.15 for every 1,000 passengers, compared with 7.53 in March. This also was the lowest total in six months. Complaints against individual airlines continued a long downward trend, with 876 filed with the government in May, down from 933 in April. The May figure was 53 percent below the 1,859 complaints received in May 1988. The department maintains a file of consumer information for more than 20,000 flights. Airlines and travel agents have access to performance data for specific flights.

<HEAD>The Folks in `The People's House' Go Ceremonial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> loves to call itself `` The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'' and its members like to act like folks On high state occasions, like Tuesday's, when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> installed a new speaker, it has to go ceremonial but it could n't quite shed its old-shoe habits. When <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> had been duly elected, the doorkeeper bellowed out, just as he does on State of the Union night, `` Mister Speaker!,'' introducing new Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> to departing Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. And <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> marched the route of presidents: down the central aisle, accompanied by an escorting committee, shaking hands all round. But still, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is the House. So some members brought their children to work, to be there for the history of it all, and plunked them on the plush brown leather seats. Six of the kids sat in one row. One tried to figure out how his white sailor hat could be made to fit his knee. Another tried out his sunglasses against the bright lights. When the adults stood and applauded, so did the kids. To old timers in the galleries, the moment brought to mind another occasion when a popular product of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> stood before the chamber at the climax of a tense national drama. That was 1974, when <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leader, arrived as president, having succeeded <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, a chief executive who resigned in disgrace, largely due to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s own impeachment process `` Mister Speaker!'' the doorkeeper bellowed then, too, but <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> showed the members that he was still a man of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with a corny line; he was, he said, the same old guy: `` I am a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, not a Lincoln.'' The ethical troubles which compelled <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to resign as speaker were no Watergate, but within the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, an insular body, the trauma was almost comparable. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> had no catchy line like <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s but he called up some numbers to deal with something <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and others had been saying about the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ that it has become a self-perpetuating body. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, just before leaving office, noted that 98 percent of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who ran for re-election won and concluded it was easier to be re-elected to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> than to the Supreme Soviet. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s answer: `` Only 7 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s current members were in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> when I was first elected in 1964. Eight-one percent of the current members have been elected since 1974. More than half of the current members _ 55 percent _ have been elected since 1980. The constant change in membership is a source of great strength for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but fundamentally, and more importantly, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> reflects the will of the electorate.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> had another comparison. He contrasted the transfer of power here with the awkward reaching toward democratic formulas in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and the bloody events in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. He said congressmen can be proud that the values which have sustained the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> `` now sweep around the world.'' `` We are,'' he said, using that phrase again, `` proud to call this the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the fundamental institution of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> democracy.''

<HEAD>Panel Told of Failures to Protect Elderly From Financial Abuses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government is not doing enough to keep the elderly from being ripped off by people appointed to handle their Social Security checks, senators said after being told of abuses. An <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> woman and a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> woman misused <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> payments that they had been entrusted to manage on behalf of elderly beneficiaries, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging was told Tuesday at a hearing. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, testified that she was told by the government that she needed a representative to handle her disability benefits because she was incapable of managing the money herself. But she said the woman who was appointed kept some of the benefits for herself, and had a history of writing bad checks. She did not identify the appointee. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of <PERSON> Marvell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, told the panel that her representative collected her disability benefits, but then refused to use the money to buy a telephone, clothes or other necessities that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> requested. `` She often would not tell me how much money she would have of mine, or what was going on,'' she said. The system is so ripe for abuse that `` in some communities in our nation, private profiteers are virtually lining up at Social Security offices in the hope they can get their hands on a beneficiary's money by being appointed a payee,'' said <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Child </PERSON>, attorney for a legal services firm in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. He called the government's oversight of the payee program `` lax.'' About 4.6 million Social Security beneficiaries have mental or physical impairments deemed serious enough that they need someone to manage their benefits. The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> accepts applications from anyone who wants to be a payee, but gives preference to relatives or to public or private groups with good records in handling elderly affairs. But Sens. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., said the government has not been vigilant enough in overseeing the `` There is some evidence that <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> has not been keeping a close watch on those who apply to be representative payees,'' <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said. `` Presently, the <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> does not do background checks, nor does the <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> monitor the program to ensure that the beneficiaries actually receive their money.'' <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Enoff </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> deputy commissioner, said the administration recognized there was a problem, and was evaluating steps to remedy it. He said the victims represent a small percentage of the beneficiarfies and are often poor or handicapped people without relatives to care for them. <PERSON> Enoff </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> verifies the identities of payee applicants, and asks them whether they have felony convictions. He said he was concerned about a bill introduced by <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> on Tuesday that would require <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> to conduct criminal background checks on applicants, while barring most creditors from becoming payees. A ban on creditors would be too stringent and would keep, for example, helpful landlords from becoming payees, <PERSON> Enoff </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>U.N. Optimistic Sudanese Relief Supplies to Arrive in June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials in charge of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s famine relief operation say an agreement between rebels and the government to allow safe transit of emergency supplies could help save up to 100,000 Sudanese lives. The delivery of food and other supplies _ before the rainy season cuts off access by dirt roads and airstrips _ is behind schedule but recent accords between guerrillas and the government improve the survival prospects for thousands, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, head of Operation Lifeline <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, said Tuesday. `` It's going to be a very difficult summer and fall, but I think at this stage, barring a collapse of the present sort of pattern of cooperation, I think we can say that the great majority of those 100,000 deaths that looked so likely in February and early March can be averted,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said. More than 60,000 tons of food has already been delivered, and the relief operation is attempting to deliver another 20,000 to 40,000 tons before the heaviest rains hit in July and August, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. `` For the first time in history, there is, in the middle of a civil war, a plan of action agreed to by both parties with ` corridors of tranquility' for the passage of supplies,'' said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, who returned from observing the operation last week. The rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> SPLA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is fighting for more autonomy in the southern provinces, where the government generally controls only garrison towns. A railway route from central to southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> is now open, said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. One rail trip was completed in late May; another is set to begin Saturday, and two more runs are planned later this month. The first train, with over 100 cars, moved south through rebel and government-held areas, reaching war-weary <LOCATION> Aweil </LOCATION> on May 28. `` At one government garrison where the train stopped overnight, the train was so long that the <ORGANIZATION> SPLA </ORGANIZATION> was guarding the tail end of the train while the government was guarding the front of the train,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. The government and rebels have both agreed to respect the `` corridors of tranquility'' as long as necessary, said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. In addition, both parties have agreed to meet in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, on Saturday to open talks aimed at reaching a comprehensive truce. The <ORGANIZATION> SPLA </ORGANIZATION> has also announced it is extending its monthlong unilateral cease-fire for another two weeks, said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. Although the rainy season has already begun, <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lifeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> has not yet lost the use of all dirt roads and airstrips, he said. Bulldozers have been able to keep open dirt roads linking <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> with southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> so truck convoys can pass, and the relief operation has been able to use lighter planes to land on rain-sodden dirt airstrips. However, a barge convoy planned for the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nile </ORGANIZATION> between <LOCATION> Kosti </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malakal </LOCATION> has not yet been able to start, said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. Negotiations with the government, unions and barge crews are still under way. Despite that setback and other delays, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said he was `` more optimistic for the prospects for success than at any time in the past.'' The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> estimates 250,000 Sudanese died last year from starvation due to flood or drought, or war-induced famine.

<HEAD>Hearing Pits Animal Rights Groups, Veal Producers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chef of an exclusive <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> restaurant says veal producers who confine calves in small stalls and feed them no-iron formula to get pure white meat have a mistaken idea of what the best cooks want. `` As a chef, the quality of the veal used in my kitchen is very important, and yet of equal concern to me is the quality of life of these calves,'' said <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palladin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jean-Louis </LOCATION> restaurant at the Watergate Hotel, in support of legislation that would change the way veal is raised. <PERSON> Palladin </PERSON> was one of 34 witnesses Tuesday at a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee hearing in a debate over whether calves destined to become cuts of milk-fed veal ought to spend their short lives in a freer state consuming more than just liquid. The legislation pits animal rights advocates against government agriculture officials and most of the relatively small <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> veal industry. <PERSON> Palladin </PERSON> and others supporting the bill sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said the rationale behind current practice is that the public wants pure white meat `` For me, the foremost concern is the taste, not the color of the meat,'' said <PERSON> Palladin </PERSON>. He said he thinks the confinement of calves in small crates can lead to weakness, illness and use of antibiotics in milk formulas, all of which affect the quality of the meat. But <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who has been raising calves in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> since 1976, said `` disease problems were nothing short of horrifying'' when she and her husband tried letting the animals roam. `` We had no control over the amount of milk calves could drink at will. Weak calves were pushed aside. Navel sucking, ear sucking and urine drinking were common,'' she said. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlone </PERSON>, associate professor of animal science at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said there is no scientific evidence that solid food is better for calves than a milk formula with nutrients. In answer to concerns about the lack of iron in calves' diets, <PERSON> McGlone </PERSON> said, `` Borderline anemia of veal calves does not cause serious health problems.'' He said many of those attacking the industry actually have a broader goal of ending all human consumption of meat. `` The veal industry is a small segment of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agriculture,'' <PERSON> McGlone </PERSON> said. `` Because of its small size, it is a relatively easy target for advocate roups that seek to reduce or eliminate use of animals by humans.'' The <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> bill would require that calves be given solid food and iron, have physical contact with one another and be kept in larger enclosures. `` The crate system most commonly used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is so confining that the calves can not turn around or lie down comfortably,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` These normally playful animals are kept practically immobile, are prone to be unhealthy and lead a miserable existence,'' said <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. Dr. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Loew </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> school veterinary medicine, said veal stalls commonly are 22 to 24 inches wide and 60 inches long. He said calves average 239 pounds when they are slaughtered. Dr. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plowman </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s agricultural research service, said about 1 million of the nearly 40 million cattle slaughtered each year are special-fed calves at the center of this controversy `` There is a general perception that calves are purposely made iron deficient or anemic to produce the desired coloration of the meat.'' said <PERSON> Plowman </PERSON>. `` This is not true.'' He said research shows that raising calves in elevated, individual stalls reduces disease and increases survival rates. When calves nuzzle each other, they pass along infections, he said.

 Even as <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> nominated <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> as Speaker of the House in a somber speech on the floor, workers were trundling his possessions out of the speaker's ceremonial office on canvas-covered carts. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> spent his final moments as speaker Tuesday holding his regular pre-session news conference but revealed little about his plans or his state of mind. He declared simply, `` I feel fine.'' Last week <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> announced he was giving up the speakership and his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat after charges of ethics rules violations that virtually paralyzed the House. By next week, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, he would be `` enjoying life, I hope and trust, rejoicing in the good portion that has followed me and the opportunities that have been given me in life.'' Colleagues said they expected the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat to keep a hand in political affairs. `` He is healthy and well and feeling good and he's going to be able to contribute to political debate and thought for many years,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has said he will resign his seat later this month. As giant orange trash cans waited to be filled with cardboard boxes stuffed full of folders, frames and plaques in his staff's adjacent office, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was asked if he had any parting words `` I might express my appreciation to all of you for keeping a robust discussion going,'' he told a room full of reporters. `` I might want to write a column or two. Someone suggested I should become a columnist. It might be a good thing. In fact, I might discover who these unnamed sources are.'' Just 45 minutes before he was to nominate <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> before <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> closeted himself in his office with notes written the night before and wrote his last speech as speaker. A floor below, outside the dining room where <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrats have met for lunch on Wednesdays with <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as their leader, Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, said he sensed an `` aura of hopefulness mixed with sadness'' prevading the Capitol. `` For the first time in three months I feel upbeat because the ascension of <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> promises a great deal in the area of rebuilding the institution -LRB- of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, which is at its lowest level,'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said. At the same time, he said he felt sadness for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who had campaigned for him and looked after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s interests in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` But I've talked to the speaker and he's at peace with himself and that made me feel better,'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said. `` He looks serene, he looks comfortable ... In the last month he had looked crestfallen.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> resigned after a year-long investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee that produced allegations that he had violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics rules 69 times. The allegations surrounded sales of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' his wife's employment by a family friend, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, and his relationship with <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Third World Falling Behind on $70 Billion Owed US Banks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal auditing agency says Third World countries are falling behind on $ 70 billion in debt repayments to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> regulators should make banks put up more reserves to protect depositors against loan losses. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the auditing arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, did not name the debtor countries. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, the third largest debtor behind <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, has paid no interest on its foreign debt for more than one year and owes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks more than $ 8.5 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said regulators should demand that banks put up about 12 times more reserves against loan losses than is currently required. `` Because banks generally respond to reserve requirements by writing down assets by the required amounts, a decline in the book value of their assets results,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said in a note on figures it sent to Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Though the auditors' report did not say so, writing down a bank's assets reduces the amount of business it can do and makes the management look bad to depositors and stockholders A bank is now only required to put up reserves when the regulators declare foreign loans it has made to be either a total loss or `` value-impaired.'' That means the debtors have not paid interest for six months or have shown in other ways that they are in deep trouble. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> regulators next week are expected to discuss behind closed doors whether to put loans to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in the `` value-impaired'' pigeonhole. The list already contains <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>. But their total debt is small compared with the major debtors. In a letter Tuesday to <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON> joined in urging that the banks put up more reserves. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> takes the lead in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulation process. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks maintain lower reserve levels than almost all other industrialized countries,'' <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON> wrote.

<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> was 30 minutes late for his first meeting as speaker with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could n't have minded, since the Democratic leader was running late from a speech that warmly praised the Republican president A few days before, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> stood outside <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s oceanside vacation home in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and publicly hailed the president's <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> arms-control initiatives and his response to the turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. At the highest levels of the nation's elective government, sweetness and light is the prevailing theme. And while this harmony may be threatened by rumblings below, including new efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to discredit <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, some political analysts are predicting a period of rare bipartisanship ahead. There are some striking similarities among <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, both in matters of style and personality. And in their appeals to bury partisan differences and work on forging consensus positions, they often sound alike. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s acceptance speech on Tuesday following his election as speaker echoed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s own inaugural address invocation of `` the age of the offered hand'' to the Democratic leadership. After lavishly praising Republican Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said Republicans and <PERSON> Dmocrats </PERSON> should `` come together, put aside bitterness and hostility.'' Of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> declared: `` We have one president at a time. And he who does not wish President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> well is no friend of the Republic.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> then came to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ late _ and the love fest continued, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> telling a bipartisan group of congressional leaders <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s election was a `` main happening.'' Outside, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> told reporters, `` the problem is to turn whatever rancorous atmosphere we have in the Congress ... back to a spirit of conciliation and cooperation.'' Like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who kept a low profile in eight years as vice president and in a string of top appointed jobs before then, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> earned a reputation for working quietly behind the scenes. He is far more subdued than his immediate predecessor, the highly partisan <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, under whom <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> worked as majority leader, as well as the colorful Thomas P. -LRB- Tip -RRB- <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, who was speaker when <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> was majority whip. Much of the same could be said of <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a former judge who was appointed to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 to fill the unexpired term of Sen. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON> when <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON> quit to become secretary of state. Even though he had no prior political experience, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> went on to win in 1982 and 1988 and became widely respected for his hard work and even-handed approach. As chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, he helped engineer the Democrats' recapture of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. All three men _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> _ have been accused of having a somewhat wooden speaking style and a low-key approach. But all three have made large numbers of friends in both parties. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> has even been known to hitch a ride to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> on Air Force Two from time to time, back when then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headed to his home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> on weekends in the days when he had more time on his hands. `` These three men are, in a single word, professionals,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, an political analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> values professionalism, you can tell from the kind of appointments he made. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> worked up through the ranks, trusted and admired by his colleagues. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was a judge, which might automatically suggest judiciousness. These are people who know what they're doing,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> continued. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, agrees, says `` this is unique for a period in which you have divided government'' with one party controlling the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and another the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` The sort of conciliation these individuals represent is perfect for this moment. But not necessarily for all times,'' <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> continued. `` It's not necessarily the best way to create innovation, or to take the political risks that are sometimes needed.''

 Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, the senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officer, plans to open an 11-day visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by asking his Soviet counterparts for details of their proposals to cut conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told reporters Tuesday he also expected to sign an agreement in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on curtailing dangerous military incidents. The focus of the trip is likely to be proposals by the East and West blocs to sharply reduce their troops, tanks and warplanes in Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The two sides have recently advanced similar proposals, but details remain to be spelled out. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in his arms-cut proposals, `` has talked about men and he has talked about weapons systems,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said in remarks at the Pentagon. `` There are a lot of questions in our mind about exactly what that means, and what dismantling means, and what they will do with those systems, and what systems they are talking about. Those questions have not all been answered,'' said <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, who is scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next Monday. He will tour five of the 15 Soviet republics. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said he would ask the Soviets why they recently increased tank production, despite statements by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that defense spending would be cut by 14 percent and military production by 20 percent over coming years. The proposed Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities, which <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said he expected to sign on the first day of his visit, is designed to prevent such incidents as the shooting death of Maj. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> at the hands of Soviet soldiers in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on March 24, 1985. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said the proposed agreement also would address naval incidents inside territorial waters, such as the bumping of two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels by Soviet ships off the <LOCATION> Crimea </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on Feb. 12, 1988, and the use of laser range finders that might blind soldiers or sailors on either side. The visit by <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, who will be accompanied by the vice chiefs of the four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military services, follows a tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last July by Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, then the Soviet chief of staff. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> has since become an adviser to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and has been replaced as defense minister by Col. Gen. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moiseyev </PERSON>. The Americans, according to an itinerary handed out at the briefing, will visit an unidentified Soviet missile facility in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, see a ground exercise in <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>, ride on a Soviet missile cruiser and watch a naval maneuver off <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION>, the northern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> port on the <LOCATION> Barents </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said he also asked to see a Soviet submarine but had not received a response.

 A key contractor helping to design the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Seawolf nuclear attack submarine says development snags could delay completion of the first vessel The warning, issued last December by the <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> News </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Drydock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, complained of a lack of progress by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and another contractor, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, in developing the combat system of sensors and computers needed to operate the new sub's weaponry. <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> said the delays could mean the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> may not get the first completed sub in May 1995 as planned. `` Continuing delays in completion of the -LRB- combat system -RRB- design or the emergence of significant changes in the design could seriously impact the lead ship design schedule,'' the company said. The Seawolf, or SSN-21, is described by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> as the key to rebuilding the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> edge in underwater warfare _ an advantage that has eroded over the past decade because of espionage scandals and Soviet efforts to build quieter submarines of their own. The report from <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> was disclosed Tuesday by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> voicing `` strong concern about a high-risk acquisition strategy being pursued by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the procurement of the $ 50 billion-plus SSN-21 Seawolf submarine program. <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> holds the contract for designing the Seawolf's hull and interior layout. The company concluded in its December report that it could not keep the project on schedule unless `` the combat system design development -LRB- is -RRB- brought in line with the ship design development.'' `` In essence, the ship design and the combat system design -LRB- have become -RRB- out of phase by over a year,'' <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> to review the program and give his view of whether all operational tests should be completed on the first sub before a full-scale production go-ahead is given. Each Seawolf is now expected to cost more than $ 1.5 billion. `` My concern about this matter has been reinforced by a copy of a letter which has recently come to my attention indicating strong concern about the design of the AN-BSY-2 fire control system ...,'' <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> wrote. The congressman said would like the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary to tell him `` when and how will you know whether the problems raised in the <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> letter will affect the planned delivery date of the first SSN-21?'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday declined to discuss the substance of the <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> report, saying `` it would not be appropriate to comment on what will become the substance of a reply'' to <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> did say, however, it was confident the combat system would be delivered on time for the lead Seawolf sub. The SSN-21, like the current 688 - or Los Angeles-class attack sub, will be designed primarily to hunt and kill Soviet submarines It is supposed to feature greater speed, better sensors and longer-range weapons than the 688 class. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> maintains the Seawolf `` is going to represent a major advance in speed, depth, quieting, weapons capability and supportability.''

<TEXT>
 The commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> has ordered every <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> aviation unit around the world to shut down for two days of refresher safety training in hopes of reversing a `` devastating trend'' in aircraft accidents. Gen. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, the commandant, wrote in a directive that 45 Marines had died this year in flying accidents and that `` crew error'' was to blame in each case. `` It is time to pause, catch our breath and come to grips with the devastating trend established this year,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> wrote in his one-page directive, which was distributed Monday night and obtained Tuesday by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our machines are not letting us down; we are letting ourselves down.'' The four-star general said he would leave it to the commanders of each unit to decide when to schedule the refresher training, but that it must be `` within the next two weeks.'' `` Forty-five Marines have perished in seven aircraft mishaps thus far in 1989. May alone saw 22 Marines and five aircraft lost. When I examine the information available on the circumstances surrounding these tragedies, aircrew error predominates and most likely will be a primary cause in all these mishaps.'' Lt. Col. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> headquarters here, said it was `` most unusual'' for a commandant to order a complete shutdown of the Marine aviation community. `` None of our people can ever recall this happening in the past,'' said <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>. `` But you can see from the directive how seriously Gen. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> takes this.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> _ both active and reserve _ operates about 1,200 aircraft of various types, spread among 87 different squadrons. The order for refresher safety instruction comes less than six months after the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> completed its safest flying year in history. Indeed, in less than six months, the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> have exceeded the entire 1988 total for aviation fatalities by 73 percent. During 1988, the corps suffered 11 so-called Class A accidents involving 12 aircraft and lost 26 people. Forty-five people already have died this year in Marine aircraft accidents involving seven aircraft. Six of the seven aircraft destroyed so far this year have been helicopters, several of which were carrying large numbers of Marines on training maneuvers. The most recent occurred May 30, when a CH-46 transport crashed into the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> after taking off from the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> off the coast of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, killing 14. Prior to that accident, two CH-46's collided in the air on May 27 near <LOCATION> Reno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, killing two Marines. On May 3, five died when a UH-1 <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> crashed during an exercise in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and one Marine died the same day when his AV-8B Harrier jet crashed at <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, S.C. In March, during the annual Team Spirit exercises in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, four died on March 17 when a CH-46 crashed. And on March 20, 19 died when a CH-53D crashed. The military services rarely discuss the probable cause of fatal accidents, instead following procedures that call for completion of a final investigative report. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s disclosure that all of this year's accidents appear to have been caused by crew error is thus unusual. It was described by one <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> source as a disclosure `` that we believe is necessary under the circumstances.'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, in his directive, said the real issue was `` the preservation of our most precious war-fighting asset, our Marines.'' And that, he added, `` demands that we be ruthlessly honest with ourselves, ensure strict accountability and rededicate ourselves to excellence.''

<HEAD>Republican Protest of Gregg Probe is Paralyzing Senate Panel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Republicans on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, angered by a Democratic-led probe into ambassadorial nominee <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s alleged involvement in the Iran-Contra affair, are leading a boycott that is paralyzing the panel. The boycott of committee meetings is preventing action on two pending authorization bills providing a total $ 16 billion authorization for foreign aid and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spending. Democrats say they may retaliate by blocking action on all diplomatic and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> appointments, including nominations for key posts the administration wants to fill quickly. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., who is spurring the <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> investigation, told reporters: `` We may not determine anything for awhile; this committee may not have any hearings on anything, including <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>. `` If this committee ca n't meet on anything else, maybe the committee also ca n't meet on <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. Republicans opened the tug-of-war on Tuesday, boycotting a working session and preventing action on a pending $ 4.5 billion authorization bill for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies. Also frozen by the standoff was a two-year, $ 11.5 billion foreign aid authorization bill. The investigation is focusing on <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s alleged links to the Iran-Contra affair while serving as national security adviser for Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The key questions are: _ Did <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> help <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> secretly and illegally resupply the Nicaraguan Contra rebels in 1985 _ Is he lying about it now On Tuesday, eight Democrats gathered to try to act on the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> bill. The only Republican present was Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the panel's ranking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member, and he walked out. A quorum of 10 members is necessary to permit the committee to act on pending legislation or nominations. `` It's very apparent that we are unable to do business because the Republicans are objecting to the fact that a legitimate committee inquiry is taking place with respect to Mr. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said Republicans in the past have held up certain nominations for months, yet Democrats continued to permit the committee to get on with its other work. `` I think the process is subjected to a kind of tyranny when ... there is this wholesale boycotting,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said. `` I would hope the comity of this institution would not lead to other important business being held up ...,'' he said. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> complained that a lack of cooperation from the administration is delaying final action on <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, saying he has had no response to requests for documents and information relating to <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>. `` The administration seems to me to be showing some contempt for the committee in this particular matter,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said the boycott is being organized by Sen. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky., who, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said, wants a specific date set for holding another hearing on <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> and a specific date for voting on his nomination `` I do n't want any suggestions made that we're holding up anything,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. `` Sen. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> is holding up. ... He's got a vendetta going against Mr. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>.'' `` This is an attempt to dredge up Iran-Contra again'' said <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>. `` I'm having a problem on my side because of their discontent over what Sen. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> is doing. I think Sen. <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>'s indignation is well justified.'' At that point, Chairman <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, attempted to move for action on the pending <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> bill. Would <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> agree? he asked. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> stood up. `` I'll see you later, Mr. Chairman,'' he said, walking from the room. `` I've got to defend my side.''

<HEAD>Study Finds Divorce Usually Sought by Wife</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wives seek divorces nearly twice as often as husbands, a government study says. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that 61.5 percent of divorces acted on in 1986 were fought by the wives. Husbands petitioned for 32.6 percent and the rest were sought jointly, the report said. Statistician <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> expressed surprise that, in a time when no-fault divorces are becoming more common, the joint petitions amounted to only about 6 percent of the cases. While the center did not provide an analysis of the reasons for the difference between men and women in seeking divorces, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> commented that over the years women have traditionally been more likely to file divorce petitions. At one time, she said, it was considered `` gentlemanly'' to allow the wife to sue for divorce, regardless of which party was at fault in the dispute. Various studies, she added, have showed that it is more often the woman who becomes dissatisfied with a marriage than the man. And the presence of children apparently did n't encourage wives to remain in unhappy marriages. In the breakup of marriages where children were present, wives filed 65.7 percent of the divorce petitions, while women initiated 56.9 percent of the divorces of childless couples. This was the first time the Center for Health Statistics, a division of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, has reported on who initiated divorces. The figures were included in its detailed final report on divorce statistics for 1986, a year that saw 1,178,000 marriages break up in the country. Preliminary reports show that divorces fell to 1,157,000 in 1987 and then climbed to 1,183,000 last year. But the reports for 1987 and 1988 have not been completed in the detail which is included in the 1986 report. While the 1986 report was the first to include figures on who initiated the proceeding, it did cover the period back to 1975, indicating that women are becoming somewhat less likely to be the one filing the papers than in the past. In 1975, women filed 67.2 percent of divorce papers, compared with 29.4 percent for men and the rest filed jointly. That was down to 63.4 percent by filed by women in 1980, with men filing 30.2 percent that year and the balance filed jointly. The new study also found that divorces were most likely to occur early in marriages, with 33.6 percent taking place between the first and fourth years of wedlock. Overall, marriages that ended in divorce lasted an average of 9.6 years, according to the analysis. The report found that first marriages lasted an average 10.7 years before divorce, while second marriages ended after an average of 6.7 years. Third marriages lasted an average 7.2 years.

 <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the syndicated columnist, is being investigated for carrying an unloaded gun into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol to demonstrate security lapses, congressional authorities said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> displayed the handgun, and a bullet, on May 24 when he interviewed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in the Capitol for a television special on terrorism, said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Riker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Riker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> claimed to have walked through a metal detector with the 9mm Austrian-made pistol on his way to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s office He pulled out the gun and handed it to the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Republican after <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said in the interview that no place was immune from terrorists. `` We realized afterward that we'd been had, that it was an on-camera stunt. ... We were taken aback, but as we thought about it, we realized he may have committed a crime,'' said <PERSON> Riker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s aides turned the bullet, which <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> left behind, over to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Sergeant at Arms <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Giugni </PERSON>. <PERSON> Giugni </PERSON> said Tuesday that the bullet and statements about the incident had been turned over to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and officers from that force were investigating the incident along with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> the following week broadast tape of the interview and footage of him walking through a Capitol metal detector. A Capitol Police duty officer said no spokesman was available to discuss the investigation Tuesday night. There was no answer at <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s home. In an interview broadcast Tuesday on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> WUSA-TV </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was asked how he would react if he were charged with a criminal offense. `` I would say that the authorities in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as usual are going after the whistleblower rather than the offense,'' he said. <PERSON> Riker </PERSON> said the news media in general could be hurt by the incident. `` The ironic thing is, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> through this stunt has hurt the media people who have to go through those entrances every day,'' he said. `` The legacy of this is the media are going to have a harder time.'' <PERSON> Giugni </PERSON> said screening has been tightened up at the building. `` Naturally they're looking more carefully at press passes and such. We normally give a certain courtesy to reporters trying to get through,'' he said.

<HEAD>Research: Risk From Pill Low for Relatives of Breast Cancer Patients</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Birth control pills pose no increased breast cancer risk even for women with a family member who developed the disease. That's the finding of a new study of oral contraceptive use among women who have a family history of breast cancer, one of the major concerns in the medical community about long-term use of th pill. `` These data suggest you do n't need to be nearly as concerned as some people thought previously if you have a very strong family history -LRB- of breast cancer -RRB-,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadel </PERSON>, co-author of the study and a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Uniformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. <PERSON> Stadel </PERSON> said that women whose mothers, sisters, daughters, aunts, or grandmothers had breast cancer are known to be at higher risk of developing the disease. As a result, doctors for years have recommended that women with such a family history not take birth control pills. The perception, he said, was that oral contraceptives would aggravate an existing risk. But the new study relieves this concern, said <PERSON> Stadel </PERSON>, and shows `` oral contraceptive use does not appreciably alter risk of breast cancer as far as we have been able to study.'' The research, published in the journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obstetricians </ORGANIZATION> and Gynecologists, involved an analysis of data collected from eight areas of the country by two federal agencies for what is called the Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study, or CASH. The CASH research examined the medical histories of 4,730 women with cancer and 4,646 who did not have cancer. From these groups, the new study analyzed the relative risk of breast cancer among oral contraceptives users who had a family history of breast cancer in comparison with those pill takers who had no family history of breast cancer. The length of time that oral contraceptives were used also was analyzed. `` We looked to see if there was a different effect for women with a strong family history compared to women with no family history,'' said <PERSON> Stadel </PERSON>. `` We found no adverse effect -LRB- from the pill -RRB-. Our data suggests that oral contraceptive use does not increase the risk of breast cancer in women with a family history.'' Though the research seemed to give definite results, <PERSON> Stadel </PERSON> said there is a need for confirming studies. `` This is the largest study of this issue, but it is one study,'' he said `` In this sort of research, we always like to see the building over time of a consensus based on more and more data. But this is certainly a strong piece in that direction.'' <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverberg </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a medical school professor who has researched any connection between birth control pills and cancer, said the findings confirm a continuing sense of confidence in the safety of oral contraceptives. `` This is not unexpected,'' he said. `` I would have expected oral contraceptives to not be associated with increased risks, even for women with a family history of breast cancer. The birth control pills now being prescribed should n't pose a high risk of breast cancer at all.'' Other co-authors of the study were <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesselman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Uniformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>IRS Favors Bill Limiting Penalties Against Taxpayers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is endorsing a bill to reduce the number of penalties it can assess against errant taxpayers. The bill, by Rep. <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, is aimed at simplifying and eliminating duplication in the penalties, which number close to 150 in current tax law. The number has risen from just 25 in 1967, reflecting to some degree <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' use of penalties to raise revenue rather than simply to encourage compliance with the tax law. More than 26 million penalties totaling nearly $ 6 billion were assessed last year. `` Penalties should exist for the purpose of encouraging voluntary compliance,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, acting <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> commissioner, told <ORGANIZATION> Pickle </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> oversight subcommittee Tuesday. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> suggested the penalty system has been thrown together helter-skelter. Unless there is some coherent philosophy underlying the structure, he said, `` it is very difficult for us, as penalty administrators, to fairly and consistently assert these penalties.'' <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>'s bill, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said, `` will result in substantial improvement to the penalty system we have now.'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> offered proposals for changing some parts of the bill, as did several others witnesses who testified. Overall, however, the witnesses apparently agreed with the position of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Motley </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, who called the bill `` a great step toward simplifying and clarifying what tax penalties exist and when they will be assessed.'' Under present law, a taxpayer can be hit with two or more separate penalties for the same violation, such as failing to pay tax on time. <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>'s bill would eliminate such duplication and consolidate different penalties for negligence, overvaluation of a deduction and understatement of income into one uniform penalty for inaccuracy. The bill would boost to $ 1,000 the current $ 500 penalty for filing a frivolous tax return, such as one that claims the income tax is unconstitutional. <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON> proposes to sharply increase the penalty for failure to file a return on time when the failure is intentional or fraud is involved. Such action could result in a penalty of 15 percent of the net amount of tax due per month, up to a maximum of 75 percent. The penalty for failing to file an information return with the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> _ such as a Form 1099 statement of interest paid by a bank to a depositor _ would be raised to a level that would depend on when it was eventually filed. The penalty now is $ 50 for each failure, with a maximum of $ 100,000 a year. The proposed penalty would vary from $ 15 -LRB- $ 75,000 maximum -RRB- to $ 50 -LRB- $ 250,000 maximum -RRB-.

<HEAD>Rules Panel Says Only a Few Bailout Bill Amendments to be Considered</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> are telling colleagues the panel is unlikely to permit the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to consider more than a few of the 100-plus proposed amendments to savings and loan bailout legislation. However, it is clear from panel members' comments that the committee will clear at least one or perhaps a combination of several of the 10 proposed amendments that would blunt the tougher capital requirements that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration says is the cornerstone of its plan to reform the industry. `` There seems to be great sympathy throughout the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to do something with this'' capital rule, said Rep. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N </LOCATION>. The committee, which decides the rules for debate of legislation in the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, heard in a 4 -LCB- - hour session Tuesday from 12 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members seeking to reshape parts of the S & amp; L bill written in the Banking, Ways and Means and Judiciary committees Forty-seven members remain on the witness list and the Rules panel scheduled another session this afternoon and may have to hold a third on Thursday. Panel members conceded that the flood of amendments means there's little hope of meeting <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s request to move the bill to the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> this week They predicted House action next week. That would set the stage for a conference to reconcile the House bill with a version passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in April and send finished legislation to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s desk in July. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials are insisting that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> require all S & amp; L owners to risk more of their own capital _ $ 3 for every $ 100 in lending _ as a buffer against losses to the government deposit insurance fund. However, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., and others are arguing that 732 of the nation's 2,949 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls should keep an accounting break known as `` supervisory goodwill,'' which in some cases allows S & amp; L owners to operate without risking any of their own money According to <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, 241 of the 732 will fail to meet the new capital requirements unless they keep the goodwill, which regulators permitted in the early 1980s as an inducement for merging with failing S & amp; Ls. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> wants S & amp; Ls to have the right to appeal to regulators to keep their supervisory goodwill, but critics say that could delay the imposition of tougher standards for as long as 18 months. Reps. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on financial institutions; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a member of the banking panel, and two members of the Rules committee, Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quillen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Tenn </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, are proposing other accommodations on goodwill, arguing that it's unfair for the government to renege on previous `` I think it's really a bad day in the history of this country when we as legislators agree to do away with written agreements the government has made,'' <PERSON> Quillen </PERSON> said. However, Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, pleaded with the <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to permit consideration of at least one amendment to strengthen capital requirements even further from the 3 percent standard favored by the administration. <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> wants S & amp; L owners to hold 4 percent tangible capital within two years and five percent after five years. In addition to the capital standards, the Rules panel was expected to approve floor consideration of an amendment by the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to add $ 50 billion in government borrowing for the bailout to the federal budget deficit. The administration favors a mechanism for keeping it out of the budget deficit.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is trying to finish crafting a bill funneling $ 3.3 billion to veterans, college students and other groups, with some lawmakers hoping to use the measure to block a surtax on the elderly. Legislators planned their fourth day of debate on the legislation today, hoping to complete work on a bill that has garnered a slew of provisions on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> since President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> first sought the measure in March. Discussion was continuing today on an amendment by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., postponing implementation of much of the new catastrophic care program for the elderly under <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, including a cap on doctors' bills <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>'s proposal also would delay for a year the surtax on people 65 or older that is designed to pay for the program. That levy can reach a maximum of $ 800 this year for the wealthiest senior citizens, and some of them have complained that the tax is excessive. `` We're laying an incredible cost on them for coverage they do not want or need at that cost,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said. But opposition to <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> came even from his own political party. `` I think I know where the crux of the problem comes from ...,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` They all live in <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and they all have incomes of $ 30,000 to $ 40,000 a year.'' <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is a retirement community in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. Democrats said the size of the surtax should be reconsidered instead in future legislation. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected 69-29 a proposal by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, allowing the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to withhold aid from communities refusing to let transit projects to companies doing business with the pro-apartheid government of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Lawmakers also adopted by voice vote an amendment by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to revamp a tax law that business considers burdensome. That followed a 50-49 defeat for Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>, R-Wis., who instead wanted the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to repeal the tax law, which forces companies to prove their health benefits are as generous to low-paid workers as they are to executives For technical reasons, <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> would have needed 60 votes to prevail. The overall spending bill is designed to provide federal agencies with enough money to see them through the Sept. 30 end of fiscal 1989. It would pump $ 1.2 billion to veterans programs, $ 892 million for Guaranteed Student Loans for college students, and $ 225 million for food stamps. It would finance other costs including those for Soviet refugees moving to this country, last year's forest fires, foster care, and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping efforts. The measure also is studded with provisions directing federal resources at projects important to individual lawmakers. Thus, it would prevent a school district in <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, from losing about $ 700,000 in federal education aid this year it would otherwise forfeit. The provision was sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Other clauses would order the Army to spend $ 50 million this year on cold weather clothes manufactured in 10 states; provide <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> political parties with $ 1.5 million to conduct a referendum on the island's future political status; and distribute $ 6.6 million in subsidies to airlines that serve small communities in 39 states. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed a $ 3.7 billion version of the bill on May 24, two months after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought legislation totaling $ 2.2 billion. The two chambers will have to agree to a compromise before sending a bill to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s signature.

 A landmark measure to create a direct tax on households and businesses to support child care was failing in early returns Tuesday as cities and child-care advocates nationwide watched. With 27 of 84 precincts reporting, the vote was 3,218 against the measure to 858 for. The measure, which faced an uphill battle to win passage by a two-thirds majority, would raise $ 1.8 million a year from residents, businesses, developers and the city's own coffers to open care centers at 30 elementary schools. The program in this city of 165,000 on the east side of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> also would help sick kids and subsidize poor parents for baby-sitting costs. `` Cities around the country are looking to the Fremont example to see whether taxpayers are willing to pay for child care,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON>, director of the Children and Families and Cities Project of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` People in 80 percent of all cities are saying child care is the most pressing need for children from birth to 9 years old,'' he said. `` Cities are looking for ways to handle that need, and resources are the biggest barrier to providing good services.'' About 100 cities offer some kind of support for child care, <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> said. Some simply coordinate programs or offer training; others spend money through general funds, federal community block grants or developer fees. `` Fremont's measure is the only example I know about of a dedicated tax for any services having to do with children,'' <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> said. `` This is on the forefront of things to come in the future.'' The measure would impose a $ 12 annual tax on every homeowner, with renters exempt, and a 20 percent business tax surcharge. It would expire in 15 years. The vote in <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION> will indicate `` how deep public support is for child care,'' said <PERSON> Abby </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, managing attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` We all have magnifying glasses and we're watching it very carefully,'' said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, coordinator of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>'s office on child care. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION>, which has 1,400 member cities and 49 state and municipal members representing an additional 14,000 cities, said many cities are watching closely. `` Advocacy groups see Fremont as an example of what can be done to deal with a need that is felt in all cities,'' <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> said. `` It's not just something for the rich or poor Lots of people need it. This measure will make city governments think about this problem.''

 More proof of the danger is needed before governments launch programs seeking to correct the `` greenhouse'' warming of the planet, a pair of scientists is cautioning. There does seem to have been a warming over the last 100 years, but too much uncertainty remains about the causes of that change to justify immediate government action, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jastrow </PERSON>, former head of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Goddard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. The effect of clouds is not well understood, and the small warming recorded so far could easily be a result of normal climate variability or changes in the brightness of the sun, explained the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> scientist. `` Current forecasts of the man-made greenhouse effect do not appear to be sufficiently accurate to be used as a basis for sound national policy decisions,'' said <PERSON> Jastrow </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jastrow </PERSON> made his comments in releasing the study `` Scientific Perspectives on the Greenhouse Problem.'' The report was presented by <PERSON> Jastrow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON>, a former president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and of <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

The study was published by the <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The institute, funded by foundation grants, conducts research on public policy issues, said <PERSON> Jastrow </PERSON>. In recent years the threat of greenhouse warming has attracted considerable attention, with some scientists warning that it could raise the Earth's temperature, changing the climate, turning major farm areas into dust bowls and melting the polar ice caps, causing a rise in sea levels. The warming would result from increases in gases such as carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere. These gases allow warmth from the sun to pass through to the earth but block outgoing radiation, raising the planet's temperature in somewhat the same way a greenhouse warms its interior. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jastrow </PERSON>'s successor at <LOCATION> Goddard </LOCATION>, has been a leader in this research, warning that the effect may already be observable in studies indicating the planet is about 1 degree Fahrenheit warmer now than it was a century ago. That conclusion has been widely debated, with various climate experts differing on the effect of clouds, urban growth and other factors in changing average temperatures. `` We do n't believe he has overstated the risks,'' of this warming, commented <PERSON> Jastrow </PERSON> of <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>'s work. But, <PERSON> Jastrow </PERSON> added, `` the one place we part company is the ability to forecast the next century from what we know now.'' <PERSON> Jastrow </PERSON> recommended increased research spending to determine the extent of the danger, if any. Research facilities costing $ 100 million or so could help provide these answers in three to five years, he said, still plenty of time to act if it is found that a gloabl warming is, indeed, underway.

 Former Philippine President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> underwent emergency surgery Tuesday, but hospital officials declined to give any immediate details. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who has been listed in very critical condition since May 18, underwent 3 -LCB- hours of surgery at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> beginning at 3:30 p.m., said <LOCATION> Gemmo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>, a family spokesman. `` He's very much alive,'' <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said, `` They did n't tell us yet what the surgery was for.'' Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Kop </PERSON> said a statement on the operation would be released soon. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 71, has been suffering from a variety of serious ailments, including kidney and heart failure, pneumonia and bacterial infections. He has been unable to breathe on his own and has been undergoing constant kidney dialysis. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who has lived here since his ouster in a popular revolt in February 1986, has been hospitalized since Jan. 15. On May 23, his doctors said it was a miracle he was still alive. `` I think if you asked any one of us, we'd all say he has a low probability of long-term surivival,'' transplant surgeon Dr. <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> said then. Although the prognosis for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> remained poor at the time, doctors would not rule out the possibility of recovery. The former leader's illness has prevented him from traveling to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to face racketeering charges alleging he plundered his homeland of more than $ 100 million and used the money to buy real estate and art in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. His wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, who also is charged, last month appealed to <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to allow her husband to die in his homeland.

<HEAD>OAS Gives Panama Mediators More Time; Panama Blames US for Crisis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> gave a team of mediators an additional six weeks to work out a democratic transition in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> but a top Panamanian official said no solution is possible so long as his country is `` permanently threatened'' by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers met Tuesday night to review the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> three weeks after they authorized envoys from <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> to try to work out a democratic `` transfer of power'' in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. During almost four hours of debate Tuesday night, there was little sign that the mediators had come close to fulfilling that goal. Tuesday was their original target date and their new deadline under the extension is July 19. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, told reporters after the session that his government had no intention of moving toward a solution so long as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintained economic sanctions and continually threatened <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> with the use of force. `` There can be no normal political process under the current circumstances in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' he said. The crisis in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> grew out of the decision by authorities there to declare national elections null and void three days after they were held on May 7. International observers claimed that the government committed fraud on a massive scale, depriving opponents of the military-dominated government of a 3-1 victory at the polls Some of the opposition candidates were brutally beaten. With the scrapping of the election returns, a crisis of legitimacy has been created, which the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> has been attempting to address. But with the passing of almost a month since the crisis reached a peak, some of the hemispheric indignation over the continued rule of <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has dissipated. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> undersecretary of state for political affairs, said the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> must take account of charter provisions calling for the establishment of representative democracy as a guiding hemispheric principle. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> must show that the charter `` is not mere words,'' he said. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> assailed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and said that the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> must consider `` further action'' against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> if progress toward democracy is not achieved quickly. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the problem,'' he said. Sept. 1 has become a `` guidepost'' for the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mediators because that is the day on which the Panamanian constitution says a new president must take office. The current president is <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ally, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recognizes the president ousted 15 months ago by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s supporters in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> recounted what he described as the series of abuses committed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s ouster. These include the freezing of Panamanian assets abroad and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refusal to pay <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` a single cent'' on operations relating to the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has contributed to the destruction of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy, <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said He noted that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> authorized the dispatch of an additional 2,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> combat troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last month after the elections and said one consequence is that the `` civilian population lives in fear'' of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military attack. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> did not oppose the extension of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mandate. The only opposition came from Nicaraguan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON>, who said no extension was appropriate without the explicit support of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Much of the day was spent discussing the propriety of giving the mediators a reporting deadline or making their mission open-ended. The mediators were said to oppose the imposition of a deadline but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other delegates argued that an open-ended mission would ease pressure on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 For Filipinos, the bloody attacks on pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have served as a shocking vision of what could have happened to their own `` People Power'' revolution three years ago. Commentators and officials have also taken advantage of the massacre of hundreds and possibly thousands of Chinese to discredit Filipino Communists, who have have patterned their 20-year insurgency on the Chinese `` people's war'' that brought the late <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> to power 40 years ago. Newspaper and broadcast commentators have drawn parallels between the turmoil in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and the events of February 1986, when hundreds of thousands of Filipinos poured into the streets to protect military officers who had mutineed against President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> ordered his troops to suppress the mutiny. But <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' troops refused to fire on civilians who included nuns, priests and students On Feb. 25, 1986, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> fled <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> for exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The only casualties were three pro-Marcos soldiers slain defending the government television station against mutineers. `` There, but for the grace of God, we might have gone in February 1986, when that glorious buzzword ` <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>' was invented,'' wrote columnist <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Soliven </PERSON> in The Philippine Star of the carnage in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` In that crucial moment, that crossroads of history, the -LRB- Philippine -RRB- Armed Forces chose to side with the people rather than with our tyrant.'' In the years since <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> fled, President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and other Filipino leaders have attributed the success of their `` revolution'' to factors ranging from the `` power of the people'' to intercession by the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. `` In -LRB- 1986 -RRB-, we were all praying because we are all Christians,'' said Cardinal <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sin </PERSON>, who called civilians into the streets three years ago. `` To us, a man is indeed very valuable. Even soldiers loyal to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> felt that their obligation is toward their country.'' Some Filipino commentators also believe the key was American diplomatic pressure. After supporting <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for years, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats warned him not to use force and finally offered him safe haven in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. No foreign government has such leverage with the Chinese. Meanwhile, the military has already begun using the events in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> as a propaganda weapon against the underground Communist Party of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said Tuesday that the events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> prove that Communism is a discredited philosophy. In a statement Monday, <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sin </PERSON> said the savagery in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> should serve as a warning to Filipinos who support the rebels. `` Please open your eyes to the reality that Communism can only make our lives more miserable,'' he said.

 It happens every year at the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, a springtime silly season when rampant rumors reign. Because the nation's highest court often waits until late in its October-June term to issue decisions in the most closely watched cases, anticipation gets the best of some. This year's first rumor bubbled up late last week when pro-choice and anti-abortion forces were convinced a decision in a key abortion case would be announced Monday. The court is being asked in a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> dispute to overturn or curtail its 1973 ruling that legalized abortion. No one could pinpoint the rumor's origin, but news reporters, lawyers and political activists helped spread it quickly throughout the capital city. The television networks, with live-transmission equipment outside the court building and correspondents wired for sound, were poised to break into their mid-morning programming Monday. The decision was a no-show. Such rumors about the timing of decisions, often assertedly based on some unnamed knowledgeable source, have an amazing track record. They are never, ever correct. But, much like a stopped watch, some day ...

 Including the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> abortion case, the court has 51 decisions to announce before beginning its summer recess. To date since October, it has issued 85 signed decisions. The term's last scheduled day is June 26, but Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> has the option of extending it. Under former Chief Justice <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> the court term often stretched into early July, but the <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> court has wrapped up the last two terms on June 26 and June 29, respectively.

 In a recent speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Australian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the current chief justice voiced concern about the number of lawyers surrounding some legal disputes. `` Obviously, if a client wishes this sort of massed battalions of lawyers on his side and is willing to pay for them, presumably no one else is the worse for it,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said. `` But I have a sense that often law firms impose this sort of a regimen upon a client without it being requested. `` There is no question in my mind that -LRB- these -RRB- developments ... have driven up the cost of legal services in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the past 35 years out of proportion to inflation,'' he said.

 News reporters who face tight deadlines on days the court issues its decisions often _ but not always _ find help in shorter summaries prepared by a court officer called the reporter of decisions. Here's an excerpt from one such synopsis accompanying a Bankruptcy Code decision earlier this term: `` The pre-Code practice of denying postpetition interest to holders of noncensensual lines, while allowing it to holders of consensual lines, was an exception to the exception for oversecured claims from the rule that the running of interest ceased when a bankruptcy petition was filed, and was recognized by only a few courts and often depended on particular circumstances.''

<TEXT>
 In an unprecedented report submitted to parliament, the government has revealed that many of the major contributors to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s political parties in last year's national elections were foreigners. The report only gave the first initial, last name and sum contributed for the 20 largest givers, but the list included figures from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, State Comptroller <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> said. She would not elaborate on the contributors' identities. The report, submitted Tuesday by Mrs. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>, publicly revealed for the first time the names of political contributors. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s two major political parties, the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, have long opposed any efforts to disclose the names of large contributors, saying it would inhibit contributions. The report named <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> as the largest single contributor. He gave $ 1.3 million to Labor. The second largest donor, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, gave $ 415,000, also to the Labor party. Although corporate contributions are outlawed, there is no ceiling on private donations. Speaking before the report was formally issued, former Labor party Secretary-General <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Baram </PERSON> said: `` To my knowledge there is no other example in the world where most of the donations that are made to political parties do n't come from the same nation where the elections are held.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> said she released the report to prevent large contributors from trying to influence <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> politics. `` If we know about these contributors and, <PERSON> God </PERSON> forbid, one of them sees it as an investment, and wants it to be realized, the public can come and help me so it does n't happen,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> said. The report listed the names of all contributors who donated more than $ 31,000 to political parties after August 20. Ms. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> first notified parties that the names of contributors would be published on that date. The election was held Nov. 1. The report lists 14 contributors who together gave $ 2.8 million to Labor and five who together gave $ 405,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. One contributor, from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, gave $ 100,000 to the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. The report did not include the names of three donators. One gave $ 250,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, and two gave a total of $ 470,000 to Labor. Ms. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> agreed to withhold publication of their names when leaders from Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> said they were in sensitive positions in foreign countries and publication of their names could endanger their lives. The report said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 17 political parties raised a total of $ 41.8 million, with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor both gathering almost $ 15 million.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has agreed to a general amnesty that is to allow 41,000 Namibian black nationalist guerrillas and refugees to return home to the territory from camps in neighboring <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. The move is part of an independence plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled for 74 years in defiance of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and a 23-year fight for black majority rule. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> signed the amnesty Tuesday, paving the way for the repatriation to begin Monday. Some Namibians will be coming home for the first time in 20 years. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said they would be airlifting the Namibian refugees at a rate of 1,000 to 1,400 a day through July. In conjunction with the amnesty, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s South African-installed administrator repealed security laws, including those allowing detention without trial and empowering <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to halt court proceedings against security force members. The repeal is a prelude to pre-independence elections in November. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s administrator, and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> had been negotiating the moves for weeks. `` The discriminatory and restrictive laws that are to be repealed represent only a small fraction of those that have existed in this territory for many years,'' <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> said. He said all 41,000 Namibians returning from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> will be covered by the amnesty. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees plans to bring the first 1,374 refugees to the northern towns of <LOCATION> Ondangwa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Grootfontein </LOCATION> and the capital, <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, officials said. They will include members of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s only guerrilla-backed movement <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> is favored to win the November elections, though it is unclear if the organization will capture the two-thirds majority needed to control a new government. Campaigning is to begin July 1, but senior guerrilla leaders have not said when they plan to come home. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and South African officials still must resolve issues including voter registration procedures and the release of political prisoners. Namibian authorities say they are holding 29 political prisoners. The guerrilla movement says 201 dissidents were freed recently. More than 4,000 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military personnel are in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to monitor the transition to independence, and <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> said he would deploy 500 more police monitors. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> independence plan in a three-nation regional accord involving the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops helping <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s government fight right-wing rebels armed by <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. At <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> announced Tuesday that two black African diplomats have been appointed as senior staff to strengthen the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Namibian independence operation. African front-line states had lobbied intensely for appointment of an African assistant to give them a stronger voice in the <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> operation. <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Legwaila </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Legwaila </PERSON>, was named an assistant secretary-general to serve as deputy special representative for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. B.A. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Nigerian </LOCATION> ambassador, was the U.N. Transition Assistance Group's special representative in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> to improve liaison with Angolan authorities.

<TEXT>
 Voters decided to close the <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> nuclear power plant on Tuesday, marking the first time an electorate has chosen to shut down an operating reactor. With absentee ballots in and all precincts reporting, 112,138 or 53.4 percent voted to close the troubled plant, while 97,698 or 46.6 percent voted to keep it open. Election officials had projected a heavy special election turnout of up to 50 percent of the 529,658 registered voters in the <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the plant 25 miles southeast of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s capital. Voters in the district that includes most of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Placer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> gave the plant a reprieve in June 1988, but put it on probation until the election this year. Though the vote was not binding on the utility district, a majority of its elected board members said they would follow the will of the people.

 Rancho Seco critics feared the 15-year-old facility was unsafe and they were angered by rising utility bills. They also pointed to a $ 400 million repair bill after a 1985 accident in which the reactor was cooled too fast, raising fears of structural damage and causing a 27-month shutdown. Supporters said the 913-megawatt plant's bad days were over since it had been overhauled and had new management. For the past 17 years, opponents of atomic power have tried unsuccessfully to shut down nuclear power plants by appealing to voters. While nuclear opponents have failed to persuade voters to close down any existing plants, they have won elections that prevented new nuclear plants from being built in some states. The industry, fearful that closing one of the few publicly owned nuclear power plants in the nation could strengthen the hand of critics of privately owned plants elsewhere, raised $ 580,000 to push for its continued operation. Opponents, which included the Campaign <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> environmental group formed by <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> and his estranged wife, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, raised $ 111,000, according to the latest campaign reports. Since its restart in April 1988, the plant has been nagged by a series of mechanical problems that shut it down or forced cutbacks in power production. Overall, since restart, the plant has run at about 47 percent of its operating capacity. But plant spokesmen <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> said the plant had won praise from the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for improvements since the accident and that the restart last year was one of the smoothest in the industry. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said other ballot measures aimed at closing or blocking nuclear power plants all had been voted down. More than a dozen such measures have appeared on ballots around the country in the last 14 years. Last November, voters in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> turned back a referendum that would have prohibited the generation of nuclear wastes. The measure was aimed at forcing the closure of the state's two nuclear plants.

 Striking miners marching through <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> this week are self-consciously following the path of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> in its bloody fight to unionize the Appalachian coal fields 70 years ago. `` It's the same struggle,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON>, a delegate in the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> member who was among 60 miners marching Tuesday. `` We're not facing rifles, but they're using the courts and economics on us.'' Since early April, the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> has been battling <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. More than 2,000 miners and their wives have been arrested for civil disobedience and the union has been fined millions of dollars. In 1921, the union faced the rifles of federal troops in the bloody five-day Battle of <LOCATION> Blair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, where 50 marchers were camped out Tuesday night. The union lost the original fight, but retrenched and later won the right to organize workers in southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> during the Great Depression. `` They lost the battle, but they won the war,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> employee for eight years before the strike. The strikers this week were marching 85 miles north to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, where they will be joined at a rally by machinists hoping to call attention to their strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is the featured speaker at the rally. Gov. <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>, a Democrat who won election last year with union support, has not said whether he will attend. `` We're going to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> to see what side of the fence the governor's on,'' said marcher <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomblin </PERSON>, 35. About 1,500 <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> workers walked out April 5 after working 14 months without a contract. More than 100 miners with the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> also have been off their jobs since January in a related dispute. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> miners claim the company, which refused to go along with an industrywide <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> agreement and has kept its mines open with non-union labor, is trying to break the union by reducing job security and setting up an independent pension fund. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> officials say they want to maintain a union shop, but with more flexible work rules permitting greater subcontracting and seven-day work weeks, to meet growing competition from non-union and foreign companies. Both sides say the outcome of the strike could affect contract negotiations throughout the coal industry. Miners started their march Tuesday with a 10-mile trek from <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> to the summit of <LOCATION> Blair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>. The route was lined with large signs proclaiming `` We Support the U.M.W.A.'' The marchers said they were carrying on the work of the miners who faced federal troops 68 years ago after marching from <LOCATION> Marmet </LOCATION> south to the mountain. This year's march reverses that path. `` They passed this way to win what they got. So we're passing this way to keep what we've got,'' <PERSON> Tomblin </PERSON> said. The Battle of Blair Mountain had its start in the southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> coal fields during the early 1900s, when miners rebelled against industry policies that kept them in check with company-owned stores and housing, and oppressive, unsafe work conditions. The conflict led to the `` Matewan Massacre'' on May 19, 1920, in which 10 people were killed, including seven coal company detectives and <PERSON> Matewan </PERSON>'s mayor. The next year, <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, a defender of the union, was shot and killed at the <ORGANIZATION> McDowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courthouse </ORGANIZATION> where he was standing trial for murder in connection with the Matewan shootout. Upon news of <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>'s death, miners marched to the mountain and were confronted by federal troops called in from <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. In the ensuing battle three union men died and 40 men from both sides were wounded. The union says it is committed to non-violent methods today, but equally committed to beating <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've got all the berries in one basket,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. `` We're not planning on losing.''

<HEAD>Justice Department Launches Criminal Investigation Of Rocky Flats</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Scores of federal agents seized records at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant as the government announced a criminal investigation of possible environmental violations at the facility. Investigators were checking allegations that employees treated, stored and disposed of hazardous wastes without permits, falsely certified federal environmental reports and concealed environmental contamination, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said 75 agents from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s office of criminal investigations began searching the plant Tuesday morning. The probe is expected to last six months to a year. Federal officials declined to say what prompted the search at the plant, identified last year by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> as the most environmentally hazardous site in the nuclear weapons industry because of contamination of an underground reservoir. Officials stressed that no new dangers existed at the plant, which processes plutonium for nuclear weapons. `` It is absolutely essential that the public understand that this investigation does not signal any major new environmental safety or health concern,'' Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>, D-Colo., whose district encompasses Rocky Flats, said the implications of the swarm of investigators at the plant `` is the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> had some reason to believe they would be risking destruction of evidence if they did n't act in that fashion. He told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he has heard `` there were several informants that became the basis for the FBI-Department of <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> investigation and that's been going on for the better part of a year.'' The plant 16 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> is operated for the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Investigators are examining actions by both government and <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> employees, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> said the company had advised employees to cooperate with investigators but declined to comment further. Rocky Flats has been dogged by environmental problems. DOE inspectors closed the plant's main plutonium reprocessing building last October for four months because of safety violations. The DOE also issued a report last December that revealed 32 new safety problems. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he authorized disclosure of the investigation because the search was a matter of public record. <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>, a staunch critic of Rocky Flats' operations, said there was apparent `` reason to believe a number of individuals at the plant were involved in concert in the effort to falsify and mislead with regard to environmental compliance issues.'' Energy Secretary Admiral <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, in a statement, said his department will perform an independent analysis of Rocky Flats operations `` and ensure that continued operations, regardless of past practices, are conducted in a safe and environmentally sound manner.'' He also said part of the plant would be shut down as a result of the investigation, but he offered no specifics in the statement. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said he was suspending `` those operations for which safety could be adversely affected by the presence and functioning of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> investigating team.'' Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON>, a Democrat who has prodded federal officials to deal with <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION>' radioactive waste disposal problems, was informed of the investigation only an hour before it was announced. <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said he was assured he would be notified immediately of any new dangers. `` I'm outraged by the possibility that some criminal action may have occurred at Rocky Flats,'' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> told a news conference shortly after the federal announcement. `` I have been trying to say to people this is an operation that we're monitoring closely and it's not endangering your health. Today I have to say to people, ` Wait a minute. I do n't know yet,''' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said. The investigation involves alleged violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act and the federal false statement law, <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> DENG </PERSON> <PERSON> XIAOPING </PERSON>, 84, who ordered troops to march on the capital to suppress pro-democracy unrest, is the most powerful leader in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> even though the highest ranking position he holds is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The commission, not the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, has the final say on military matters. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was purged twice by radicals during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and then staged a comeback that transformed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> from a country dominated by ideological battles into one with pragmatic, market-oriented economic policies. Living standards have improved for millions of Chinese but the modernization drive has led to serious problems of inflation and corruption. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has been out of sight since May 16. Chinese sources say he has been hospitalized for treatment of prostate cancer. The government denied a report Tuesday that <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> had died, calling it a `` fabrication designed to make people uneasy and create chaos.''

 <PERSON> ZHAO </PERSON> <PERSON> ZIYANG </PERSON>, 69, reportedly purged for sympathizing with the students, was general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> since 1987 and had been the nation's leading advocate of rapid economic reforms. As governor of <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province in the late 1970's, he led the country in successful experiments in restoring family farming. In 1980, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> brought him to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and he was quickly named premier. He became party chief in 1987 following the ouster of fellow reformist <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, who was blamed for student unrest. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was last seen on May 19 when he went to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> to meet student hunger strikers. He is said to be under house arrest.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> LI </PERSON> <PERSON> PENG </PERSON>, 60, who declared martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on May 20, has been premier since April 1988. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> studied in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the 1950's and represents the technocrats now filling many government offices. He opposed <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s moves in market-oriented reforms, saying he supports the plan but prefers a more cautious pace. One <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> newspaper reported that <PERSON> Li </PERSON> was shot Sunday by a police officer in the Great Hall of the People and wounded in the thigh. It said <PERSON> Li </PERSON> was not seriously injured and the officer was immediately shot to death. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> has not been seen in public since he met three new ambassadors May 25 and said the government was `` stable.''

 <PERSON> YANG </PERSON> <PERSON> SHANGKUN </PERSON>, 82, who supported <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s declaration of martial law and led the hardliners demanding a tough stand against the students, became <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s president, or head of state, in April 1988. The post of president is largely ceremonial but <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> has close ties to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> and holds a seat on the 17-member party Politburo. A career military man who was active in <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> campaigns in the 1930's and 1940's, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> was appointed permanent vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in 1982. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>'s power in that post reportedly has grown and some say he has been running the commission.

 Stock prices rose sharply in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today, while the dollar edged up against the Japanese yen amid uncertainties over turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, dealers said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION>, which slipped 5.07 points Tuesday, rose 174.88 points, or 0.52 percent, closing at 33,626.89. The index had fallen four straight days since Thursday. The dollar ended trading at 142.80 yen, up 0.17 yen from Tuesday's 142.63-yen finish. After opening at 142.45 yen, the currency ranged between 142.40 and 143.00 yen. <PERSON> Toru </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanai </PERSON>, foreign exchange analyst with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the unstable Chinese situation encouraged dollar buying, but speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> might cut interest rates also gave participants a reason to sell the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. `` We had a lot of dollar buying because many investors believe the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> money is a safe investment in time of emergencies,'' he said. `` But they did n't want to hold too many dollars either because of expectations the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> might cut its interest rates soon.'' Investors speculate the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> may ease its monetary policy following the cut in the prime lending rate on Monday by major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks. <PERSON> Kanai </PERSON> said there were unconfirmed rumors that the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> intervened in the market to support the yen when the dollar hit the 143-yen mark. `` It had no impact on the market,'' he said. The central bank usually does not comment officially on its market interventions. On the stock market, dealers said the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index began to rise as investors picked up cheap issues following the four days of losses. But trading was basically directionless because of uncertainties over political unrest in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which made many institutional investors remain on the sidelines, said a trader with a major securities firm. Speculative buying pushed up the index, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Trading was moderate, with volume on the market's first section estimated at 600 million shares, up from Tuesday's 550 million shares. Among the winners were steel and construction issues.

 There's no periscope and there is water inside, but a two-man submarine built by students is <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>'s bet to crack the eight-minute kilometer and win the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Submarine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Race </ORGANIZATION>. After months of planning and production, the cigar-shaped Icarus was launched Tuesday on its first voyage _ in the Alumni Pool of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. They did n't go very fast: swimmers lapped them. <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Goudey </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> project director, said the $ 5,000 top prize was a major incentive to enter the one-kilometer race off <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> later this month. `` When the prize was announced, the idea of winning, combined with the reputation <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> has in doing well in these kinds of things, was motivation enough to get us involved,'' <PERSON> Goudey </PERSON> said. `` We all want to be heroes.'' The two-person submarine's trial run did n't get off to a flying start. Students in the project _ <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mead </PERSON>, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Cangahuala </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, all 23; <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nee </PERSON>, 22; and <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>, 18 _ added and removed small floats to the submarine to balance it under water. The craft's nose was too light, then too heavy, then too light. After about 30 minutes of tinkering, the crew began slowly propelling the Icarus back and forth with <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> providing the legwork for the pedal-powered craft. Swimmers on the other side of the pool easily lapped the submarine during its first efforts. But as navigator Cangahuala and <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> hit their stride, the Icarus began picked up speed. The three-day race, beginning June 23 off <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, is sponsored by the H.A. <ORGANIZATION> Perry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit scientific foundation created to inspire development of undersea technology through education, research and experimentation. The MIT entry will be up against 18 other submarines from 16 colleges or engineering firms. <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> crew will use `` ringers,'' or athletes, to pedal the submarine. The subs are `` wet,'' or water-filled, meaning the pilot and first mate will have to wear SCUBA equipment. If Greek mythology has anything to do with it, the MIT entry could be the favorite to win the competition. According to legend, <PERSON> Icarus </PERSON> and his father, <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION>, attempted human-powered flight. While <PERSON> Daedalus </PERSON> stayed aloft, Icarus plunged into the sea.

 Turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> provoked protests worldwide against the violent suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, while economic fallout from the crisis was building throughout <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The unrest that left hundreds and perhaps thousands of people dead has seriously damaged the goodwill and trust once extended the Communist nation. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> have barred diplomatic contacts with officials in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> banned military sales to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> today rebuked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for trying to exert pressure on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> over what it said was a `` purely internal affair.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> sells <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> more than $ 600 million of military equipment a year, and private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dealers sell another $ 85 million. Officials would not provide <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s military sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> set the amount at $ 4.7 million a year. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> expressed `` utter revulsion'' at the Chinese crackdown and said, `` We will be thinking how best to demonstrate that in practical ways.'' The Dutch government summoned Chinese Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ping </PERSON> and told him the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> `` is exceptionally shocked by the violent and brutal actions of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>.'' The 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> strongly condemned the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> action and appealed to authorities to stop using force. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> called on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders to use `` wisdom, reason and a weighted approach'' but did not denounce the violence. The Soviet Foreign Ministry made no comment. The two communist giants are trying to mend fences after decades of estrangement. <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Occhetto </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, urged the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to take a strong stance against the massacre and distanced his party from the leaders responsible for the crackdown. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> has the largest communist party in the West. Meanwhile, Chinese students and others staged protests outside <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> embassies in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhabi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and other cities. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, authorities used tear gas to disperse 4,000 people in the twin city of <LOCATION> Kowloon </LOCATION> who tried to break into <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> banks in the area and hurled stones and bottles at police this morning. Singaporeans joined a movement started earlier in the week in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to withdraw $ 32 million in deposits from <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> banks out of fear and to protest the bloodshed in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, bank officials said. <PERSON> Wewe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cho </PERSON> <PERSON> Yao </PERSON>, president of a <ORGANIZATION> Singapore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> group </ORGANIZATION>, the Chinese Clan Associations, said the killings in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had shaken the confidence of foreign investors. About 76 percent of the 2.6 million people in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> are ethnic Chinese. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, wreaths were placed outside <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> office in memory of those who died in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and some people wore black armbands. Authorities in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> lifted a ban on telephone links to the Chinese mainland to encourage private contacts between people on both sides of the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Straits </LOCATION> and to help break a news blackout inside <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, Communications Minister <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chien-pang </PERSON> said. The links will be through <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and will be operable within three days, he said. The Nationalist government, which lost a civil war in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to the Communists in 1949, has lifted restrictions on visits to the mainland the past two years, although it continues to ban official contacts. The <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s state radio station, kicked off a 24-hour news broadcast to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on shortwave channels with a hotline accepting telephone calls from <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> listeners. About 20 leaders of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> began a 15-day hunger strike to mourn the deaths in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, while in the central city of <LOCATION> Miaoli </LOCATION>, about 74 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, 10,000 people rallied in protest. Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, in remarks to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said `` leveling guns at the people is a grave matter.'' Japanese Vice Minister <PERSON> Ryohei </PERSON> <PERSON> Murata </PERSON> summoned Chinese Ambassador <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhenya </PERSON>, and told him the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was `` very regrettable,'' but <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> continued to view it as an `` internal affair,'' a ministry official said. Negotiations on a $ 120 million loan for an oil project and another $ 250 million loan through the <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> were cut off, said <PERSON> Teruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Takada </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the largest contributor of aid to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the assistance, most in the form of loans, has totaled more than $ 6.1 billion during the 1980s. Many governments have advised their citizens in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to leave the country as reports spread of Chinese soldiers battling each other in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Some, including <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, have ordered the evacuation of non-essential diplomatic personnel and dependents. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> urged the 1,440 Americans in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to leave and made arrangements for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to fly them to safety.

 A Democratic congressman seeking to avenge a narrow defeat eight years ago and a Republican who vanquished seven rivals in the primary won the right to battle for governor. Democrats on Tuesday overwhelmingly nominated Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, while his congressional colleague <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> won the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination in a far closer race. Elsewhere, voters for the first time decided to shut down an operating nuclear power plant. A measure that would have kept open the troubled Rancho Seco plant in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was rejected by 53.4 percent to 46.6 percent. The vote was not binding on the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> Municipal Utility District, but the plant operators said they would begin shutting down the plant today. Looming budget problems, soaring auto insurance rates and high property taxes promise to dominate campaigning for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s Nov. 7 gubernatorial election. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> is making his third try at the governor's office. He lost to Republican Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> in 1981 by a heartbreaking 1,797 votes out of 2.3 million cast. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> ran third in the 1977 Democratic primary. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> emerged from a tight four-way primary battle to score a surprisingly decisive victory, winning by nearly 27,000 votes. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> already has targeted <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> with statewide mailings of news clippings that describe his role as a political powerbroker in his district in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, across the state line from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> said he is optimistic and wasted no time in jabbing at his opponent's longtime ambitions. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> has been running for governor nearly 14 years now,'' <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> said he did not care which <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> won Tuesday. `` I am looking forward to taking charge of an out-of-control state government. We need someone who knows the answer is not new taxes, but the courage and willingness to make hard decisions. ... We will ease the crushing burden of outrageous property taxes on the citizens of this state,'' he said. Since losing to <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> has carefully built solid support among Democrats and has softened his image. He was perceived as brusque and aloof in the 1981 race. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> ran on anti-tax platforms and attacked the rapid growth of the state budget, which doubled during the <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> administration. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> supported President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative and distinguished himself on the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, while <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> gained a national reputation as a fighter for the environment and author of the Superfund cleanup law. In the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary, <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> was attacked by one opponent for his dismal attendance record in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year, and most of his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> foes charged he knows little about state issues. Former Attorney General <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON> and state Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON> were in a close battle for second place. Sen. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardinale </PERSON> ran a distant fifth, while three other Republicans shared about 3 percent of the vote. With 5,817 of 5,845 precincts, or 99 percent, reporting, <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> had 110,852 votes, or 29 percent; <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> had 84,124 votes, or 22 percent; <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON> had 81,193 votes, or 21 percent; <PERSON> Gormley </PERSON> had 65,684 votes, or 17 percent, and <PERSON> Cardinale </PERSON> had 32,159 votes, or 8 percent. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> beat his challengers in all 21 counties, scoring the most decisive <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary win since 1965. He maintained a low profile during the campaign against <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> and Assemblyman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON>. With 5,818 of 5,845 precincts reporting, or 99 percent, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> had 248,059 votes, or 68 percent; <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> had 60,470 votes, or 17 percent; and, <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> had 55,929 votes, or 15 percent. <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> by law was not allowed to seek a third consecutive four-year term.

 Former Philippine President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was said to be resting comfortably after emergency surgery for an abdominal infection, but his prognosis for recovery remains poor, a hospital spokesman said. During Tuesday's three-hour operation at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, surgeons drained a pancreatic abscess, the suspected source of the persistent infection, said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiwanak </PERSON>, the hospital's assistant administrator Following surgery, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 71, remained in very critical condition as he has been since May 18 when he was readmitted to the intensive care unit with a variety of serious ailments, <PERSON> Tiwanak </PERSON> said. An infection had plagued <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for the past few weeks. Doctors believed it was centered in his abdomen but were not sure of its exact location, <PERSON> Tiwanak </PERSON> said. `` They felt his condition was worsening and they needed to do the exploratory surgery,'' he said, adding they were not certain if there are other sources of infection. Doctors hoped to see some improvement in his condition today, he said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> agreed to the surgery after doctors explained that tests indicated an infection, said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON>. `` They did it cautiously. They went through several X-rays and several scans first,'' <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON> said. `` The surgery was a good call.'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazo </PERSON>, an ardent supporter, said he saw <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> after the surgery, and saw him `` resting comfortably. He is sleeping, but he looks good.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, was at his bedside Tuesday night, <PERSON> Lazo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who was hospitalized Jan. 15, has been suffering from kidney and heart failure, pneumonia and bacterial infections and has been undergoing kidney dialysis. He breathes with the aid of a respirator. On May 23, his doctors said it was a miracle he was still alive. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has lived in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> since his ouster from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in a popular revolt in February 1986. His illness has prevented him from traveling to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to face racketeering charges alleging he plundered his homeland of more than $ 100 million and used the money to buy real estate and art in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who also is charged, last month appealed to <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to allow her husband to die in his homeland. The request was denied.

Two other Soviet finalists were <PERSON> Elisso </PERSON> <PERSON> Bokvadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aleksei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultanov </PERSON>, who at 19 was the youngest finalist and the sentimental choice of the audience. Other finalists, out of a field of 38 that began competing May 27, were <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Cocarelli </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Benedetto </PERSON> <PERSON> Lupo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ying </PERSON> <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The quadrennial competition was launched in <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON>'s hometown in 1962 and has become one of the world's most prestigious piano contests. Each of the finalists will perform two piano concertos with the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra. The medalist will be chosen Sunday. Besides launching a career, first place means a gold medal, $ 15,000, a Carnegie Hall debut recital concert, concert tours and free air travel. The finalists were announced at 1:15 a.m., about 2 -LCB- hours after <PERSON> Lupo </PERSON>, the last of 12 semifinalists to play, finished <PERSON> Rachmaninoff </PERSON>'s Sonata No 2 in B-flat minor. <PERSON> Sultanov </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student, had brought more than half the audience to its feet Saturday with a rousing finale of <PERSON> Chopin </PERSON>'s Sonata No. 3 in B minor. `` I identify in my own mind so with each one of these young artists that has come for the competition, because the common bond that we each have is that we all started playing the piano when we were very, very small,'' said <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON>, who is 54. Judges chose the 12 semifinalists from a field of 38 representing 19 countries. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Coronado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> semifinalist.

 The ducks have been dumped and their supporters are crying foul. The few Muscovy ducks that have survived a 17-month-old feud over their presence in this north <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coastal community were exiled by commissioners at a late-night session Monday unattended by most pro-duck forces. On a 3-2 vote, the city commission banished the half dozen remaining <PERSON> Muscovies </PERSON> and disbanded a committee that had been formed to resolve the dispute. No destination or departure date has been decided for the ducks, which once numbered near 150 but dwindled after some residents complained the large fowls defecated profusely and harassed other animals. The duck debate became a cause celebre in January 1988, when the commission voted to reduce the <LOCATION> Muscovy </LOCATION> population from 150 to 20. The ducks were caught and taken to farms or residences outside the city and eggs were destroyed. In late August, a Muscovy swooped down and attacked a city commissioner and his family. In December, pro-duckers accused anti-duckers of running over the birds with their cars. One duck was found with its legs chopped off. Commissioner <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> did n't present his resolution to oust the Muscovies until shortly before midnight Monday because the commission had a two-hour public hearing on a new veterinary clinic. `` The ducks have to go,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. `` Loud mouths and money have talked against the ducks, and we ca n't match that,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanairsdale </PERSON>, the only pro-duck committee member to witness the vote. `` I'm really taken aback.'' `` Some people are mad as hell about it,'' said Commissioner <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodson </PERSON>, who also backed the birds.

 People in more than a dozen provincial cities have taken to the streets to protest the military massacre in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, blocking major roads and railways with barricades in anticipation of military assaults. Six people were killed when they run over by a train while manning a barricade in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and tens of thousands set up roadblocks in <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION>. A Chinese source in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> said besides the six dead, six other people were injured Tuesday night when a train, unable to stop, struck them as they were gathered by a barricade on tracks near <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> station. <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said angry crowds set fire to the train engine and 21 railway security officials were beaten and injured by crowds who tried to prevent them from putting out the blaze. A Scottish student in the ancient capital of <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION> said huge crowds were holding anti-government demonstrations today in front of city offices. He said barricades had been set up on roads leading to city as rumors spread the military would be called in. Official <ORGANIZATION> Xian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> claimed crowds had `` wrecked communications facilities, blocked buses, trolleybuses and cars, and forced passing vehicles to halt.'' It said the demonstrations had `` seriously wrecked the city's life. The Scottish student, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he had seen no evidence of violence or looting. He said foreigners in the city were planning to leave for <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, which also has had demonstrations, although smaller in scale. Radio broadcasts from <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province, said `` a handful of thugs'' on Tuesday continued to `` smash cars, loot shops, rob pedestrians and throw petrol bombs at bookshops.'' On Sunday `` a number of scoundrels'' stormed offices of the city legislature, beating up 300 security officials and police, the broadcasts said, adding that about 100 people were arrested and one was shot and wounded. The report did not mention unconfirmed reports that 20 people were killed in the rioting. Crowds continued to erect street barricades in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Changchun </LOCATION>. `` If this situation continues, the city's economy will be paralyzed,'' the local radio quoted <LOCATION> Changchun </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Shang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhenling </PERSON> as saying. In <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> there were small funeral marches for the thousands of people killed and wounded when troops stormed <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to drive pro-democracy students from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. An American student in the port of <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> said the city was disrupted by demonstrations and foreign students were trying to make their way out. Large demonstrations were also reported in <LOCATION> Nanjing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION> and the southern city of <LOCATION> Changsha </LOCATION>, a hotbed of protests since the pro-democracy movement began nearly eight weeks ago.

 The turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has turned what had been an increasingly popular destination for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> travelers into a canceled trip for many vacationers. The bloody upheaval has prompted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour operators to cancel vacation packages to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and compelled airlines specializing in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> region to re-evaluate their service to Chinese cities on a daily basis. A number of operators, including <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday they had decided to scrub tours to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Tourism had been one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s fastest-growing industries before the military crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on pro-democracy demonstrators. `` We're looking at it on a day-by-day basis,'' said <PERSON> Lythia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rousseas </PERSON>, a marketing associate for <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tours </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, considered the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour operator specializing in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Customers have been promised full refunds, but may experience delays in claiming them from smaller tour operators, travel experts warned. Travel companies continuing normal operations, such as <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, are closely watching developments in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We're continuing to monitor the situation,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> at its <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> headquarters The airline is operating a normal schedule of three flights a week between <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, he said. `` The flight yesterday had a very light load going in -LRB- to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> -RRB- _ just five people. We had 307 going out.'' United has adjusted the schedule to minimize risks. The planes now arrive at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in daylight, stay about an hour and leave; previously, they had an overnight layover. <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> has doubled its Tokyo-Beijing schedule by adding three flights a week, according to <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Simoncelli </PERSON>, a spokesman for the carrier in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The flights out of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> are fully booked through Saturday, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued a new travel advisory Monday, warning Americans not to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and for those in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to stay indoors. The department also urged caution in other <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> cities. On Tuesday, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration urged the 1,440 Americans in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to get out, and said it was considering using chartered aircraft to evacuate Americans from the capital and other areas of the country. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> said its four tour groups currently in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ about 80 travelers in all _ have been told to cut their visits short and leave the country immediately, said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Rada </PERSON>, a company spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 Sixty-nine years after women won the right to vote, they are on their way to winning potty parity, thanks to lawmakers in the state's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The Republican-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday approved a bill that requires buildings constructed after June 1, 1990, to have the same number of toilets for women as men. That's to correct an age-old inequity when it comes to bathrooms, according to the bill's sponsor, state Sen. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Velella </PERSON>. Current <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state law allows men to have more toilets than women, and that's a `` gender-based inconvenience'' and a potential health hazard, <PERSON> Velella </PERSON> said. Besides, women take longer than men, so they should have at least as many stalls in public restrooms, <PERSON> Velella </PERSON> said. The bill passed 40-1. <PERSON> Velella </PERSON>'s bill probably wo n't make it into law this year. As of Tuesday, there was no similar bill in the Assembly.

 A passenger said it `` felt like death'' when turbulent weather buffeted a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet, tossing babies in the air and bouncing luggage and a food cart off the ceiling of the plane. At least 21 people were injured, none seriously, after a DC-10 bound for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> dropped 100 to 200 feet Tuesday while traveling at 37,000 feet over <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, officials said. Passengers said at least two babies were pulled from their mothers' arms by the force of the drop, with one plucked out of the air by a man who lunged to catch her. The other woman could n't find her baby for several minutes, said passenger <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON>, 29, a <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, printing engineer. `` There was a woman in front of the plane holding a baby and I saw that baby bounce off the ceiling,'' he said. `` I thought we were done, I thought it was all over, it was that violent. Seats were broken and luggage racks were broken.'' `` It felt like death,'' said passenger <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, the president of a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> equipment company. Others on <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 90, which was carrying 232 passengers and 11 crew members, said they felt like they were riding in a roller coaster or a dropping elevator. `` Anything that was n't tied down flew up to bounce off the ceiling,'' <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON> said. Four people were admitted to hospitals after the plane landed at about 7 p.m. at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, authorities said.

 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> will cut back its nuclear test program in a move to limit rising defense costs, Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> told a parliamentary committee. In a written statement released Tuesday, <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the reduction plan but no details were given. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> conducts nuclear tests at its <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> center at <ORGANIZATION> Mururoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atoll </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> reported that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> exploded a 20-kiloton nuclear device Sunday at an underground site in <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polynesia </LOCATION> believed to be <LOCATION> Muraroa </LOCATION>. It was the third French nuclear test this year and the 106th in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s underground series. The government's policy is to neither confirm nor deny reports of its nuclear tests. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>'s statement did not say how many tests the French had planned to carry out or how great the reduction would be. President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> announced May 24 that the defense budget would be cut $ 2.5 billion over the next two years. But the defense budget still will increase by about 3 percent next year and 4 percent in 1991. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>'s statement also said: The launching of a new generation of missile-launching submarines would be set back about six months. Work on the new Rafale fighter will be delayed for about two years and a battlefield radar surveillance system called Orchidee will be delayed a year. In other reductions the statement said the number of fighter planes destined for the armed forces would be cut from 33 to 28 units and the number of light transport vehicles to be delivered to the army would be lowered. To avoid `` price drifts and financial approximations'' on major programs a new external auditing system will be in place in the autumn, <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> said. It will be jointly directed by an army controller and an inspector of finance and will be able to call on private auditing agencies.

<HEAD>NCNB Launches Loan Program For Child Care In South Carolina</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bank is offering low-interest loans for the start-up or expansion of day-care centers to make child care more widely available to working parents. `` The biggest ` why?' is that we just really feel like it is the right thing to do, because there is, as we perceived it, a continuing need for quality day-care facilities in the state,'' said <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, a regional bank. The bank will lend money to operators of licensed child-care programs at the bank's own cost of funds. On Monday, that would have meant 8.53 percent for a 15-year loan, or nearly 3 percentage points below the prime rate. Some of the loans will be guaranteed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a fairly new concept,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` There have been other things in other states with various governmental agencies being involved, but this is the first thing we know of that a bank has actually gone out and tried to do something to be of assistance.'' The program is limited to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> for now, but <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said that if it is successful, North Carolina-based <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> might expand it to some of the other six states in which it operates. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said he had n't heard of any similar loan programs <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Yes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> child-care resource and referral agency, said the program was important symbolically and financially. `` I know of child-care providers who quite frankly would expand with this fund, who are waiting to take advantage of something like this,'' she said. `` The fact that a major bank would come out and make a commitment like this is certainly symbolic of the community need.'' The program also won praise from the office of Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, who backed a compromise child-care measure passed earlier this month to give tax breaks to businesses that offer child-care programs to their employees. `` I think it very clearly dovetails with the legislative initiatives of this year, which clearly focus on private sector involvement in expanding day-care opportunities,'' said <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> <PERSON> Eskew </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman.

 A 600-year-old landmark oak was intentionally poisoned with a tree-killing herbicide, officials said. `` It's obviously not an accident,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Giedraitis </PERSON>, a city forester who has been directing efforts to save the <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION>, under whose branches legend has it <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, the father of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, signed a treaty with the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> in the 1800s.

The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, which has been investigating the incident, said initial test results pointed to a strong herbicide. `` It's pretty nasty.

Treatment of the tree last week consisted of replacing contaminated soil and injecting charcoal and bacteria into the ground to neutralize the chemical.

<TEXT>
 Real estate tycoon <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> is mentally incompetent to stand trial on tax evasion charges, a judge ruled. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> on Tuesday severed <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> from the trial of his wife and two others after finding that the 80-year-old hotel magnate can not assist in his defense because of memory lapses and reasoning difficulties. The judge did not dismiss the 47-count indictment against <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, only delayed his trial indefinitely. But noting that medical experts expect <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s mental deterioration to continue, the judge said, `` For all practical purposes, today's order will remain the final ruling in the government's case against this defendant.'' Citing several doctors, including a court-appointed neuropsychologist, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s condition had been aggravated by a series of slight strokes. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and his 68-year-old wife, <PERSON> Leona </PERSON>, were indicted in April on charges they evaded personal income taxes by disguising about $ 4 million in renovations to their <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, mansion as business expenses. The couple head a $ 5 billion hotel and real-estate empire. `` Just as no man by position of wealth stands above the law,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said, `` so too will no man, who is unfit to stand trial, be subjected to a trial simply because the public's interest in his case is great, or simply because some people may erroneously conclude that the system enables a wealthy man to avoid the consequences of his conduct.'' <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> declined to comment after the ruling and was ushered by aides from the courthouse to a limousine. His wife did not attend the hearing. Jury selection for the trial of Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and two former aides begins June 26.

 The Chinese government says that 300 soldiers, `` thugs,'' bystanders and students have been killed during the martial law occupation of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. But most other estimates of casualties are far higher. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON> said on Tuesday that 7,000 people, including 5,000 soldiers, have been injured and 400 other soldiers are missing and may be dead or wounded. Non-official sources say Yuan's figures on civilian casualties are far too low, but most have different estimates on the number of victims. They range from 500 to 12,000 people slain. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence reports indicate 3,000 people probably were killed, according to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said estimates of the number of dead could go higher. Nearly all of the deaths and injuries occurred Saturday night and early Sunday when troops, firing randomly into large crowds, smashed through barricades to reach Tiananmen square and attack demonstrators demanding democratic reforms. One doctor said Sunday that a quick check of 10 hospitals placed the death toll at 500. Other sources, compiling various reports and surveys, estimated more than 1,000 people had been killed. That number has increased with additional details and rumors of killings. Some officials of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said 2,600 people were killed but <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> office has refused to provide any figures. One <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> newspaper reported 5,000 deaths and 30,000 injured. An Eastern European diplomat, whose country has good relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, insisted that 12,000 people were slain by soldiers as they attacked protesters in Tiananmen Square. That figure is certainly high. Probably fewer than 10,000 people were in the square when the troops moved in and most were able to escape unharmed. But students who had joined the <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> occupation said hundreds of colleagues from the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> who were huddled around their `` Goddess of Democracy'' statue in the square were shot or crushed by tanks. <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students said 150 of their fellow students who were in the square are missing. There were rumors that after the square was cleared troops burned many corpses in large bonfires and other bodies were removed by helicopters and garbage trucks to minimize the death count. Yuan's statement said only 23 of the 300 people fatally injured were students. The exact number of people killed may never be known. Victims were taken to dozens of hospitals, clinics and homes, and there is no indication the government will reveal many details of the tragedy. And the death toll mounts. Troops manning checkpoints in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> continue to fire on unfriendly crowds and victims fall.

 The battleship USS Iowa left today for a six-month tour of duty in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> with the cause of a gun turret explosion that killed 47 sailors still uncertain. Several dozen relatives of the 1,500 crewmen gathered at the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> Naval Station to watch the ship leave. Family members waved, cried and embraced each other as the ship pulled away, its crew in dress whites lining the rails. <PERSON> Cherrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> said she and her husband, seaman <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, were worried about the ship's safety. `` It's scary,'' she said. `` You do n't know what to expect.'' She said her husband has 18 months left in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and is anxious to leave the battleship. Other relatives said they were not worried. `` It does n't seem to be anything that would happen again,'' said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jegel </PERSON>, the wife of a crewman. The No. 2 turret damaged in an April 19 explosion in one of the ship's 16-inch guns will be used during the deployment to train replacements for the dead sailors in the workings of the gun, ship spokesman Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Goforth </PERSON> said Tuesday. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has barred the firing of 16-inch guns aboard any of its four battleships until the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> investigation is completed. Shipboard work on the investigation has been completed, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. Although the turret is not in working condition, crew members said the guns can be moved and the area of the blast has been cleaned up. The ship will undergo about $ 13 million in repairs when it returns from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators have yet to report on the cause of the explosion during an exercise off <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Speculation has focused on faulty gunpowder, inadequate training and a crewman who may have set the blast to commit suicide. Despite uncertainty about the cause, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> sailors who spoke to reporters said they were anxious to resume firing the World War II battleship's 16-inch guns. `` The longer you wait, the more you're going to think about it. The sooner we do it, the better off the whole crew is going to be,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>, a fire control crewman who spoke on condition his last name not be used. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> will have the use of its six five-inch guns and surface-to-surface missiles during the tour of duty.

 A Palestinian suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was hacked to death with a hatchet and hanged naked by chains from a utility pole in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> today, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports said. Masked youths also seriously injured a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> woman and her teen-age daughter, who were accused of aiding the Israelis, beating them with clubs and chains and stabbing them. The army confirmed the Arab man was slain in the city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. It said the victim had a criminal background and that police were investigating. Also today, soldiers maintained a curfew for a fourth day in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, confining more than 700,000 people indoors. The restrictions have prevented nine of an Arab hospital's 12 doctors from reaching work because the physicians lacked special curfew passes, said <PERSON> Jorgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosendal </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Palestinian doctors said a 75-year-old <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> man was hospitalized after being struck in the head with a bullet when troops opened fire on stone-throwing demonstrators at the Shati refugee camp. Also in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, soldiers blew up the home of a 17-year-old Palestinian convicted in a military court of leading Molotov-cocktail attacks on Israeli patrols. The home in the town of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lahia </LOCATION> belonged to the family of <PERSON> Basam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaaban </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Makusi </PERSON> and housed at least 13 people, neighbors said. A second home in <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lahia </LOCATION> that belonged to the family <PERSON> Akilan </PERSON> <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bamilat </PERSON> was bulldozed. <PERSON> Bamilat </PERSON> also was convicted of anti-Israeli activities, the army said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and international human rights groups have strongly opposed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s use of home demolitions as a punitive measure, saying it constitutes unfair collective punishment that often is carried out before Palestinians are tried in court. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION> three Palestinians were wounded in a clash between troops and stone-throwers that broke out as soldiers conducted a search-and-arrest raid, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. During the raid, soldiers also reportedly demolished two illegally built homes in the village. The Israeli Maariv daily, meanwhile, quoted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence experts as telling <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials they expected an escalation in the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising, as well as increased efforts by Palestinian rebels to obtain firearms. Participants in the 18-month-old uprising so far have mainly used stones and firebombs in their attacks. The death of the suspected collaborator, <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ras </PERSON>, 30, raised to 509 the number of Palestinians killed in the uprising, which has also claimed the lives of 22 Israelis since beginning on Dec. 8, 1987. In all, 48 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs on charges of collaborating with Israelis during the uprising. The women accused of collaborating and beaten were in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports identified them as <PERSON> Najeeha </PERSON> <PERSON> Kudruj </PERSON>, 45 and her daugher <PERSON> Lina </PERSON>, 17. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has rejected numerous appeals from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> for him to meet with the organization's chairman, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rejects any contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, claiming it is a terrorist organization bent on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s destruction. In southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> today, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> helicopter gunship fired three rockets at positions manned by Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, injuring at least three, police in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> said. It was the seventh Israeli air attack in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year.

<TEXT>
 A proposal to get heavy trucks off the street during rush hour has gotten the green light from major construction unions and businesses, Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. Following long negotiations, city officials exempted trucks and other equipment required to pour concrete, lay hot asphalt and erect structural steel from the traffic - and smog-control plan, the mayor announced Tuesday In return, the construction industry agreed to shift its work hours _ without premium pay _ to 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. instead of the current 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. to reduce truck and automobile traffic, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. `` Compromises such as these will ensure cleaner air and provide free-flowing streets and highways for all in the city of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> area,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. The plan is expected to go before the City Council next month. However, Councilman <PERSON> Zev </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaroslavsky </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> later in the day approved spending $ 250,000 to help develop the plan, said much work remains. `` There are a lot of flaws to any program which deals with city streets and does n't deal with freeways,'' he said. `` And I do n't think you can deal with one city and not deal with surrounding cities. The plan's one-hour shift would remove about 125,000 construction workers from city streets during the morning and afternoon rush-hour, the mayor said. The altered work schedule involves 83 union locals, including boiler makers, brick layers, carpenters, operating engineers, Teamsters, general contractors, pipe trade workers and painters. The proposal, developed by the city with a regional air quality control agency, would require truck operators to pay a surcharge to use city streets during rush hour.

 Roman Catholic leaders facing a shortage of priests have moved into the video age with a 30-second commercial that asks young Bostonians to abandon society's self-indulgent values for the religious life. `` If <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> were alive today, he would be on Madison Avenue,'' Cardinal <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON> joked on Tuesday in unveiling the TV spot. `` We have in our seminary some very successful yuppies,'' said Law, whose 2 million-member archdiocese is the nation's third-largest `` They were in that scene but felt it was n't responding to the deepest feelings in their heart. The church hopes stations will run the ad for free as a public service announcement. It was developed for free by an ad executive. `` The attitude in the last 10 years has been ` you can have it all and you do n't have to feel guilty about anything,''' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON>, who put his agency to work on the campaign after reading about the shortage of priests. Law said his archdiocese is short about 28 assistant pastors. The ad is n't much more than a blur of decadent visions: expensive jewelry, fast cars, caviar and champagne. But at the end, the screen goes black and a pair of hands emerge holding the Eucharist. `` A world that does n't deny itself anything could use a few men that do,'' says an on-screen message followed by a telephone number. The Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, who worked with <ORGANIZATION> Fortuna </ORGANIZATION>, said the church has to take a more progressive approach if it's to compete with things of the flesh. `` Priests do n't get hit by a bolt of lightning. They go through a natural process,'' he said. `` And we have to recognize the impact the media has on people today. It's how we communicate.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakowicz </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Niles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> seminary, said he has used billboards to advertise the priesthood in his diocese. He said a flashier approach to promoting the priesthood was n't necessarily less sincere. `` I certainly believe the priesthood is a call from God,'' he said. `` A billboard or television ad is n't going to create a vocation ... but it's planting a seed.'' However, <PERSON> Sakowicz </PERSON> said the ads have not been `` real successful in terms of actually getting men to the front door.'' The Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> tried to plant similar seeds in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> archdiocese in 1987 when he launched a campaign that included radio spots and ads in Sports Illustrated and People magazine.

 A man who has passed himself off as an astronaut, senator, pro athlete and gynecologist says he's going straight. He's entering politics. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Hunt, 27, is collecting signatures to run as himself against Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Colella </PERSON>. He said he made up his mind during a three-month stint in jail. `` I will be the next mayor of <PERSON> Revere </PERSON>, I have no doubt,'' the man of many disguises said Tuesday. `` I am honest. I think the people are saying that if this guy can do what he did, maybe he can do something for this community.'' In his heyday, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s favorite guise was that of an astronaut. Wearing a uniform and aviation wings ordered from <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> lectured on aviation to pilots, went to the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> and drank tea with the lord mayor of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. `` People like me,'' said <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, who trained as a plumber. `` I know how to talk to people. I'll make a great politician.'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> shows little remorse about his past. `` I went to the White House, I was made citizens of countries, I was an impersonator and there's no law against that,'' said <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>. `` I had fun. I'm a thrill seeker.'' According to information that surfaced after his arrest in February on charges of swindling a couple out of $ 4,000, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> also masqueraded as a fighter pilot, building contractor, baseball player and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> captain. Earlier this year, he was ordered to pay restitution to the couple and placed on a year's probation. He was also convicted of credit card fraud and put in jail. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said his `` impersonations'' led to friendships with such Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Atlantis shuttle pilot <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>. During his years of posing as others, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said he was never tripped up by anyone. He said he reads voraciously on subjects like aviation and nuclear war and picked up other knowledge from `` my friends in high places.'' The only time <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> recalls faltering was during a lecture to pilots when someone asked the `` climb rate'' of a F-18 fighter and he was off by 2,000 feet. `` They just thought I was tired,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Troops in the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> have not been able to halt bloody ethnic riots that have left 67 people dead and prompted thousands to flee, officials and a newspaper reported today. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies the situation was under control but not stable, and said there were still incidents of arson and killing `` It has not changed for the better,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` It concerns us very much.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> joined him in appealing to ethnic Uzbeks and <PERSON> Meshki </PERSON> <PERSON> Turks </PERSON> to halt the bloodshed. Interior Minister <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON>, in an interview published today in the communist youth newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` It is now difficult to maintain stability in areas where Uzbeks and <PERSON> Meshki </PERSON> <PERSON> Turks </PERSON> live together.'' He told the newspaper 11,000 of the 15,000 ethnic Turks living among the 2 million Uzbeks in the <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> have been evacuated to temporary refugee camps. The unrest, which broke out on May 23, has mainly involved Uzbeks and the Turkish minority. The newspaper said 67 people have died and 417 homes were burned in the rioting. Most who lost their homes were ethnic Turks, it said. It also said 87 soldiers have been injured. The Communist Party daily, Pravda, said 9,000 <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> soldiers were trying to maintain order in the <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, a cotton - and grape-growing region of eastern <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> exiled about 300,000 ethnic Turks to <LOCATION> Uzebekistan </LOCATION> in the 1940s. The Turkish minority, who are Moslems, have pressed recently to return to their homeland in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, near the Turkish border. The violence is the latest ethnic dispute in the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where unrest in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> area and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> has killed scores of people and left thousands homeless. <PERSON> Nishanov </PERSON> said the violence in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> began with a dispute over the price of strawberries in a market. <LOCATION> Uzbeki </LOCATION> sources said it started between an ethnic <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> and a Tadzhik and <PERSON> Kirghizian </PERSON>, two other local ethnic groups. But Uzbekis resentful of the Turks joined the fray. The youth newspaper said soldiers trying to end the violence had `` honestly fulfilled their duty.'' There was national outcry after soldiers in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> used chemicals, shovels and clubs to break up a pro-independence protest on April 9. Nineteen civilians were killed, and one was shot by soldiers for violating a curfew. <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> said arson, robbery, and looting attempts persisted in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> despite the heavy military and police presence. He said 315 people were arrested for violating curfew. Soldiers guarded streets, squares, government buildings and fire stations, the interior minister was quoted as saying. Chronic local unemployment and economic downturn has also added to tension in the region. The <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> were the principal labor force used to build an irrigation system in barren north-central <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, which became a flourishing farm district. Emigre sources say many were overworked and died.

 Mayoral candidate <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> is taking an earlier-than-planned leave from his law firm to avert further attacks over its work for the Panamanian government. The former chief federal prosecutor in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> said through a spokesman Tuesday that he will leave the payroll of White & amp; Case on June 15 and close out his work there by June 30. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> had planned to leave later this summer. He moved now to devote more time to campaigning and defuse criticism over his affiliation with the firm, said spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s opponents have suggested the Republican tainted himself by joining a firm with links to <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> dictator Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug smuggling charges. `` The people scared by his candidacy have been able to divert attention from the real issues facing this city,'' <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> said.

 A first-in-the-nation plan under which <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> will take over <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION>'s troubled school system is headed for Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' desk, where its fate was unclear. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gave the plan final approval in a voice vote late Tuesday. House endorsement came earlier in a 122-24 vote after a sometimes personal debate that had some lawmakers near tears. Under the plan, <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> would run the 3,500-student system for 10 years and pump in money from private donors and foundations for a variety of new programs, including early childhood education, counseling and nutritional services. Legislators and teachers, however, have raised concerns about provisions exempting <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> from open-meeting and public-records laws. Teachers fear BU may make key personnel and salary decisions behind closed doors. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he supports the concept but would not back the measure unless such concerns were addressed. The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> added no such amendments. Press secretary <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubber </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was reviewing the legislation this morning and `` will do something today'' without indicating what action that would be. <PERSON> Chelsea </PERSON> schools have been woefully underfunded, according to officials, and the school system in the largely working-class, Spanish-speaking city outside <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> has one of the highest dropout rates in the state. Rep. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dedham </LOCATION>, though a supporter of the concept, said Tuesday she was concerned about the public-scrutiny provisions.

Who do you think is going to appear if BU walks away?'' In an oblique reference to <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON>'s husband, who is a car dealer, <PERSON> Voke </PERSON> said, `` People who own car dealerships and people who own banks do n't live in <LOCATION> Chelsea </LOCATION>.''

 Tens of thousands of mourners today chanted support for <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s interim successor, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, at a memorial service for the revolutionary patriarch at <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Iranian new reports said almost 11,000 had been injured during the demonstrations of national grief since <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> died on Saturday night. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio quoted an unidentified health official as saying `` many died,'' but no number was given. Eight deaths were reported on Monday. News reports said 438 people had been taken to hospitals. Carrying black flags and portraits of the imam, or spiritual leader, today's crowds at <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> chanted `` The imam is in heaven today'' and `` Better we were dead and you were here with us.'' The 86-year-old <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, who turned <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> into a fundamentalist Islamic state after the overthrow of a 2,500-year-old monarchy in 1979, died of a heart attack on Saturday. He had undergone intestinal surgery 11 days earlier. Today's memorial service was held at the site of a weekly prayer service. Attending were <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>, Chief Justice <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardebili </PERSON>, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s president, was named caretaker leader on Sunday, winning 60 of 74 votes cast by the Assembly of Experts. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> had formed the group to handle his succession. `` Obedience to <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> is obedience to the imam of Ummah -LRB- The Islamic nation -RRB-,'' the crowd chanted. After the ceremony, many people beat themselves rhythmically on the head in a traditional gesture of grief by Shiite Moslems. Many fainted in the heat. They were lifted above the crowd and passed overhead to stretchers that took them to first-aid stations. However, life was gradually returning to normal a day after the city was convulsed with grief during the funeral of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. Shops reopened today with long lines for bread and other supplies. Heavy traffic also reappeared on the streets; private cars carried black flags and portraits of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> on their windshields. Also today, the official <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> news agency reported that <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> removed as his designated successor in March, visited his grave in <LOCATION> Beheshte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zehra </LOCATION> cemetery. The news agency said the cemetery was still mobbed with people paying their respects at the grave. On Tuesday, mourners blocked a van carrying the body in an open coffin from the square where it laid in state for 24 hours in an air-conditioned glass cubicle. Scrambling for mementos, they grabbed the white burial shroud and tore it to shreds. The body, which fell to the ground, was taken away in an ambulance and lifted by helicopter to the gravesite.

<HEAD>Citywide Child Care Measure Defeated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREMONT, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A first-in-the-nation measure that would have taxed residents and businesses to pay for day care citywide was trounced at the polls. `` It's a resounding victory for those family values that have gotten us this far,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Samson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION>, which opposed the measure. He said before the election Tuesday that parents who had already raised children without help would defeat the measure. With all ballots counted, 3,671 or 22 percent voted in favor of the measure, and 12,697 or 78 percent voted against it. The tax needed a two-thirds majority to become law in this city of 165,000 on the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Under Measure B, households would have paid an additional $ 12 annually and businesses a 20 percent tax surcharge to raise $ 1 million annually. An additional $ 800,000 would have come from general funds and developer fees. The money was slated to buy 30 portable day-care classrooms, provide child-care vouchers for poor families and train child-care providers. While other cities subsidize child care for the poor, <ORGANIZATION> Fremont </ORGANIZATION> attempted to tax citizens directly to pay for child care for the entire community. The proposal drew support from working parents, feminists and business leaders. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of the pro-Measure B Citizens for Quality Child Care said he may return with another version. `` Children do n't go away,'' he said. `` People are going to have to recognize and deal with it one way or another.'' Supporters of the measure maintained that `` children are the responsibility of the entire community and that's precisely the point of disagreement,'' <PERSON> Samson </PERSON> said. `` We're frightened by that point. Children are the responsibility of their parents except where financial assistance is a necessity.'' Despite the lopsided defeat, just getting the measure on the ballot is an accomplishment and a signal the public recognizes child care is `` a pervasive problem for all classes,'' said state Assemblyman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, co-chairman of a task force on the changing family.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the June 6: <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s response to student protests: In the end, the old men who cling to power in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> could think of no better way to deal with six weeks of popular clamor for change than by ordering the army to turn its machine guns and tanks against the protesters. The ensuing slaughter in the streets of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has appalled the world and quite probably severed the final cords of respect linking <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ruled with their rulers. ... It was a response of a kind that invites open rebellion. At no point during the demonstrations did the protesters ever attack the unique authority claimed and exercised by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. ... Instead there were calls for a freer press, for curbs on rampant official corruption and nepotism, for the regime to pay more attention to what the students and the masses want. ... The regime has claimed from the beginning and claims now that only a handful of troublemakers were involved in the calls for a freer society. That attempt to minimize the depth of the protests fools no politically aware person in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. What has taken place, what still goes on, is a mass protest triggered by frustration and anger over economic and political conditions. ... The costs of this morally odious action to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s stability, to its international standing, to its prospects for future development are certain to prove enormous

The West has no active roll to play in the drama engulfing these nations. But <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in his second term and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of late have correctly noted that an economic hand extended during periods of liberalization in communist countries pays dividends to all. In the future, economic relations with the communist bloc should be geared to the degree of which these nations reform themselves and encourage private-market initiatives. That wo n't prompt the East to embrace capitalism. But it will stimulate the transition from a political system economically bankrupt at its inception to a new economic and political order befitting a world about to move into the 21st century.

 June 2 Post-Bulletin, <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, on Bush-Soviets: President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has responded effectively to recent policy initiatives by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.

It also was well-received in this country, where public opinion has tended to believe that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and less bellicose attitude are genuine and hopeful signs. There is no assurance that reforms now under way in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> countries or in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will succeed. Repression may return. But whatever happens, the people in communist-dominated countries never again will be as docile or submissive as they have been for the past 70 years in the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> and the past 40 years in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is right in encouraging these reforms. He is right in challenging Soviet leaders to reduce armaments to a level that makes sense for defense, but drastically reduces offensive capability.

 The government said today that savings and loan customers withdrew $ 5.4 billion from their accounts in April, a high number but an improvement compared with the record outflows earlier in the year. It was the 12th consecutive month of withdrawals and the sixth in a row when outflows exceeded $ 5 billion, according to a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the nation's 2,934 S & amp; Ls. In the first four months of the year, customers withdrew $ 33.7 billion more than they deposited, compared with a $ 16.2 billion gain in deposits during the same period of last year. Withdrawals set a one-month record of $ 10.8 billion in January, slipping to $ 9.2 billion in February and $ 8.3 billion in March. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON>, chief economist of the bank board, said the April figure is better than it at first appears. `` About half of the outflow is accounted for by 10 thrifts, four of which are insolvent,'' he said in a statement. `` The deposit outflow figures are even smaller when you account for seasonal factors, since one of the poorest deposit flow months of the year is April when people are paying income taxes. `` On a seasonally adjusted basis, the outflow was $ 1.6 billion, down sharply from $ 6.7 billion in March, and the smallest outflow since ... last September.'' <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> attributed the continuing withdrawals to the failure of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to keep pace with rising interest rates offered by competitors such as mutual funds and to orders from regulators requiring overextended thrift institutions to shrink. Private analysts say lack of public confidence in S & amp; Ls is also a factor. To remedy that, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to move more swiftly on its bailout plan, now not expected to reach the president's desk until next month.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rejected an attempt by lawmakers today to name maverick Communist leader <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> as head of a government watchdog agency. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolbin </PERSON>, party chief of the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, to head the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees government planning and spending. But a parade of Supreme Soviet deputies took the floor to promote <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> for the job. They praised <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s reputation for independence and battling corruption, which they said made him better suited for the post. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, however, insisted it was his constitutional right to name his own choice, subject only to the legislature's consent. After permitting more than an hour of debate, during which deputies spoke on behalf of either <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> or <LOCATION> Kolbin </LOCATION>, the president moved to cut off further discussion and forced a vote that resulted in overwhelming confirmation of <LOCATION> Kolbin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> himself took the floor near the end to say he thought <PERSON> Kolbin </PERSON> was qualified for the post, but he did not withdraw himself from the running. Only nine of the 509 deputies participating voted to reject <PERSON> Kolbin </PERSON>; 34 deputies abstained. Under the confirmation procedure, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s name was not submitted for a vote. Earlier in the day, Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> was bombarded with lawmakers' complaints about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s economic and environmental ills, then won near-unanimous approval to remain at the helm of the country's vast bureaucracy. The new Supreme Soviet legislature, elected from the membership of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> with 500 of the 509 deputies voting for the 59-year-old technocrat. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, a former factory director, has been premier since September 1985, overseeing efforts to implement <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic and political reforms. Already tapped for the post by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, he had been expected to win confirmation by the new legislature. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> as a `` determined proponent of the policy of perestroika'' and defended his record as the country's economic chief But other legislators grilled him about poverty, poor agricultural performance, a shortage of consumer goods and the ecological crises in many Soviet cities. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Komarov </PERSON>, a deputy from <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, commented that <PERSON> Gosagroprom </PERSON>, an agricultural superministry created at the start of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and abolished last March, was so inefficient that `` people were saying it was the most successful action by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> against the Soviet economy. A Lithuanian deputy demanded to know what the government plans to do about 43 million Soviets he said are living below the poverty line, calling their position `` disastrous.'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> agreed that something must be done but did not specify what. Deputy <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Miloserdny </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> heads for short-sightedness, saying it had led to a shortage of `` the most basic consumer goods.'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> denied that the council had made `` strategic errors'' in implementing reforms but admitted to `` some specific mistakes that had a negative effect on the economy.'' For example, he said attempts to make state enterprises more independent led to an `` unbalancing of the consumer market.''

 The butcher raised his cleaver and slammed it into the neck of a duck at a <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> grocery store. `` Killers,'' he spat out as he chopped the duck and listened with two other men to a Chinese-language radio broadcast on the weekend massacre in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Anguish pervades this Chinese enclave south of downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, as it does in other Chinatowns around the country. Groups of people _ mostly men _ squat on street corners or sit in restaurants. Newspapers in hand, they talk about the military suppression of the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s student-led, pro-democracy movement. `` The tanks,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON>, pointing at a newspaper picture of the scene in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square. `` Students were in a tent. The tanks, they crush them, over and over! Until all bodies be a mess! A mess!'' Yuan's face twisted in pain and he took off his glasses to wipe the corners of his eyes. A pastor at the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> was handing out fliers advertising a prayer service. `` The only thing we can do is pray,'' he said. About 16,000 people live in the 15-square-block <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>. The district's commercial strip is a tourist attraction with its welcoming green and red gate and blocks of restaurants and gift stores. After the massacre, residents of Chinatowns in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and elsewhere held demonstrations against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s hard-line leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> residents grab for the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and other Chinese-language newspapers every morning, said <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Ti-yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON>, a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> bureau. Some wait for an hour by news stands for delivery trucks that arrive at 10 a.m. Advertisements in the World Journal announced a meeting planned for Sunday to raise money to buy facsimile machines to get news out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and medical supplies and airline tickets for students who want to go to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to demonstrate. `` It's going to be very dangerous,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON> said, nodding. `` There are rumors that doctors who treat the wounded in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> are executed.'' Rumors seemed to be as prevalent as hard news along the commercial strip. `` I heard that <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> is dead,'' a bartender said in the Three Happiness restaurant. The Chinese government on Tuesday denied the rumor. At <PERSON> Mabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Moy </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seasons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Moy </PERSON> has been counseling people not to return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` I tell them they better think it over before they go,'' Ms. <PERSON> Moy </PERSON> said. `` Everyone in <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> knows each other and I'm not going to put anyone's life in danger just to sell a ticket.'' Many people in <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>, like the butcher, would not talk with a reporter, and some who did would not give their names. `` I do n't even feel like eating,'' said a Chinese student who declined to give her name. She works part time in a gift shop packed with paper fans and miniature Buddhas. Her family, including her husband, are still in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. She talked with them by telephone on Monday. `` My brother and my husband spent the whole night at Tiananmen Square the time they started shooting,'' she said. `` I'm lonely here,'' she said, adding she had planned to return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> next year. `` Now I do n't know when I can see my family.''

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> told a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> does not possess a nuclear weapon, will not build one and `` will not provoke a nuclear arms race'' on the Indian subcontinent. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> made her pledge in an address in which she said democracy is on the rise in her region and dictators are in retreat around the world. She said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> represent a partnership for democracy that must redouble its efforts to bring a broad-based, democratic government to war-scarred <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have traveled a long road with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in quest of self determination,'' the Pakistani prime minister said. She said that now that Soviet forces have withdrawn, `` let us not leave with indifference, we must not abandon the cause.'' Turning to the most active concern voiced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about her country's conduct, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has no intention of becoming a nuclear weapons power. `` I can declare that we do not possess nor do we intend to make a nuclear device,'' the Pakistani prime minister said. She said her government is ready to accept international safeguards on its nuclear materials and reactors `` on a non-discriminatory regional basis.'' <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has long advocated a nuclear-free zone in the region, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said, adding that her country is prepared to conclude a nuclear test ban with neighbors in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. She mentioned no other country. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s regional rival, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, has resisted such proposals unless they include <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> which already has nuclear weapons. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> told her audience gathered in the chamber of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>: `` We will not provoke a nuclear arms race on the subcontinent.'' Earlier, a senior administration official told reporters that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has agreed to sell <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> 60 more F-16 fighter jets, meeting a longstanding request by the Moslem nation. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the president's national security adviser, said Tuesday night that the deal, which was not officially announced, was complete except for congressional notification. He spoke with reporters after a state dinner in honor of Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. The F-16 deal reportedly is worth about $ 1.4 billion. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s talks Tuesday focused on the bloody conflict in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s defense needs, its nuclear program, and the international battle against illicit drugs, officials said afterwards. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which has given refuge to 3.6 million Afghan refugees, have cooperated for years in the effort to support the Afghan rebels seeking to topple <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s Marxist government. With a glittering dinner and a full-dress military review, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> orchestrated a warm White House welcome for the 35-year-old Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who is the first woman to lead a Moslem nation and is the world's youngest prime minister. In his formal farewell remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he and Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> had `` discussed ways to encourage a political solution in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'' that would replace the `` illegitimate regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'' with a peaceful and non-aligned representative government. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will continue to explore any serious avenue towards this end,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> replied: `` We are in complete accord'' on the course of policy in regards to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. She added that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> `` remains committed to a political solution of the Afghan problem.'' The late President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ul-Haq </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutoo </PERSON>'s predecessor, had rejected the idea of a political settlement in neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father was by deposed <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> in 1977 and hanged two years later. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> remained in power until perishing in a mysterious plane crash last year that also claimed the life of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> and an American general. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed aside reporters' attempts to ask about earlier reports of the F-16 deal. An administration official, briefing reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> discussed the F-16 sale, but added that he did not anticipate any specific announcement during her visit. The official, speaking under condition of anonymity, indicated there were no stumbling blocks to the sale. The two leaders also discussed efforts to combat drug production and trafficking. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he applauded Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s `` tough stance on eradicating the opium cultivation'' and thanked her for extraditing an alleged drug trafficker. After a luncheon in her honor at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> witnessed the signing of agreeements providing for $ 465 million to help <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> finance housing, narcotics and education programs. The agreements are part of a $ 2.28 billion, six-year aid package designed to support <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s economic development, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is the third largest recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid.

 Two Cuban-born Republicans today entered the race for the congressional seat left vacant by the death of <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, the liberal Democrat whose district came to be dominated by conservative Hispanics. State Sen. <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> and conservative businessman <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> announced bids to become the first Cuban-American in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported today that Democratic state Sen. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> also will run. The special election will be held Aug. 29. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON> pledged to continue the district's tradition of `` a leadership which has been based on a caring conscience and conservative convictions. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>'s passing has left a void that is nearly impossible to fill.'' She said her priorities are bridging the ethnic and social differences in the district, protecting <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, waging war on drugs, taking a tough stand on <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and strongly supporting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> called the special election on Tuesday, a day after the 88-year-old congressman was buried in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> after a week of mourning. `` <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> will be difficult, if not impossible, to replace in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But it's vitally important that we move as quickly as possible so that the people of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 18th congressional district can be represented,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. Primaries were set for Aug. 1, with runoffs, if needed, on Aug. 15. Pepper was elected to the seat after its creation in 1962 and won re-election by large margins every two years He drew no opposition last year. In his absence, Republicans are hoping to control the district, whose registration is 54 percent Democrat, down from 72 percent a decade ago. Hispanics are estimated to comprise nearly half the district. `` I think the chances are pretty good for a Cuban-American to be elected,'' said <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendixen </PERSON>, a Democratic strategist. `` Without a doubt, that person would be the most powerful Cuban-American in the country.'' The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area is home for many of the 1 million Cubans who have come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s revolution 30 years ago. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, an independent elected in 1985 as the city's first Cuban-born mayor, has indicated he will support <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, a 36-year-old educator, is married to popular <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>, who has said he is happy in his current high-profile position. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, a millionaire banana importer, is a staunch supporter of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. Republican State Rep. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutman </PERSON>, whose Cuban-Jewish heritage fits two large ethnic groups in the district, also was mulling over a candidacy. On the Democratic side, state Sen. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said he would decide by Friday whether to run. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, 67, shares much of Pepper's constituency and liberalism, but may have problems with Hispanic voters because of his opposition to Nicaraguan Contra aid <LOCATION> Hialeah </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, also Cuban-born, was a possible Democratic contender as were Commissioner <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gersten </PERSON>, State Attorney <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> and former school board chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cejas </PERSON>.

 Swarms of desert locusts have been spotted in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> nations of <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday.

The report said there might be extensive breeding later in the year. The agency said most swarms were small, but one was reported to cover an area of 60 square miles. Swarms of locusts emerged in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> at the end of last year but have not been reported in past months. The report said the locusts' flight activity was limited until about three weeks ago. It was not immediately known what caused the change.

 A gas producer has agreed to pay $ 2 million to eight families forced from their homes by toxic waste, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <ORGANIZATION> Colonial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged dumping coal-gasification byproducts decades ago where the homes were later built, the newspaper reported.

The <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified sources as saying the company, in addition to paying each family $ 250,000, agreed to pay $ 750,000 to the Department of Environmental Quality Engineering for testing, fencing the site and cleaning it. Residents had claimed their homes were rendered worthless and the land was so contaminated that sections turned blue from cyanide and other pollutants. They were moved to condominiums last year, with the state paying their rent. `` We're greatly relieved and very happy,'' said <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeley </PERSON>, who moved with his wife and three children last year. `` It's like being a bird in a cage and suddenly having the door sprung open.'' The families' attorney, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlitchmann </PERSON>, told the Globe the settlement is believed to be the first environmental case between a company and homeowners to be resolved through mediation rather than a lawsuit. Mediation took six months, <PERSON> Schlitchmann </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> launched an effort Wednesday to get local government officials involved in making sure everyone is counted in 1990. The agency said it is sending technical guides to 39,000 local governments, encouraging them to review census maps to make sure all housing units are included. More than 100 million census forms will be sent to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> households at the end of March 1990 to be used in completing the national head count April 1. The bureau said it will hold 470 training sessions for local officials across the nation. Then, later this summer, census maps will be sent to the local governments for comparison with local tax records, occupancy and demolition permits, utility hookups and other records to make sure no home has been overlooked. Once that is completed the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> will compile block-by-block housing counts and send them back to local officials in November for yet another check prior to the actual census. Census counts are vital to city, state and other local governments because those numbers are used to determine representation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and in the distribution of billions of dollars in state and federal funds to communities.

 Between 12 and 22 percent of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s children _ as many as 14 million of those under age 18 _ are suffering from some type of mental disorder, but only about a third are receiving any treatment, a study released today reported. A committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> said in the study that though millions of childhood mental disorders are not treated, the situation has improved in the last 20 years and there is `` demonstrable progress'' toward understanding, preventing and correcting many of the mental diseases of youngsters. `` There is increasing reason for optimism that many of the major childhood mental disorders are responsive to treatment,'' the committee said. But in far too many cases, no treatment at all is being offered to troubled youngsters, the committee said. At a news conference today, committee chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leckman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said that of the mentally ill children `` a third or less are treated,'' often because their problems go undetected or because resources for care are not available. `` We have a long way to go,'' said <PERSON> Leckman </PERSON>. `` This group has been underserved -LRB- by society -RRB-. There is a stigma associated with mental illness. That is a clear and persistent problem in our society.'' Americans respond to physical disorders much more readily than to mental health problems, said Dr. <PERSON> Fredric </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, director of the mental health division of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. `` Eighty percent of the phyically disabled children are served,'' he said. `` For mental disorders, less than 20 percent of the children are served, even if they are noticed.'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said that studies have shown that even medical professionals, such as pediatricians, generally recognize only about about quarter of their patients who are suffering from mental disorders. He said often the children who receive attention by society are only those with disruptive behavior. Members of the committee said it is difficult to obtain reliable data to precisely define how many of the childhood population are suffering from mental problems, but <PERSON> Leckman </PERSON> said there are indications that `` the likelihood is that the rate is increasing.'' Dr. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, vice chairman of the committee and a professor of psychiatry at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said studies have shown a definite increase in childhood suicides and in eating disorders. Though conservative estimates place the number of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children with mental disorders at about 7.5 million, or 12 percent, the committee said the number could be much higher. `` Recent studies have suggested that the ange may be as high as 17 to 22 percent, or 11 to 14 million children and adolescents,'' the report said. Problems identified in the report included mood disorders such as depression, behavior disorders such as hyperactivity, developmental disorders such as autism, as well as chronic drug use, sexual problems and eating disorders including anorexia. `` Approximately 2.5 million children in this country received treatment in 1985 for a mental disorder,'' the committee reported. `` This means that at least another 5 million other children needed some type of intervention, but did not receive any treatment.'' Poverty and ghetto life contribute heavily to the nation's troubled youth, the study said Youngsters with mental and behavioral problems `` may exceed 20 percent in some populations, such as inner-city children, who are exposed to severe psychological adversity,'' the study said. The total cost to the nation has not been measured, but the committee said the figure would probably run into the billions of dollars a year. In addition to the costs of treatment, the committee said there are substantial indirect costs from the need for social services, criminal justice and special education. `` Each year in this nation about 49,000 children and youth are held in various public youth facilities, and many thousands more are in adult prisons,'' the study said. `` Millions of children are involved with child welfare, foster care and residential treatment. Many of these children have a diagnosable mental disorder, but receive neither diagnosis nor treatment.'' The study also said that about 25 percent of all mentally retarded children also have behavioral and emotional difficulties. These compound problems often result in such children being confined for life to institutions. A national plan of coordinated research and training that would attract more professionals to the mental health field, and lead to a better understanding of how to prevent, evaluate and treat mental illness in children was proposed by the committee. The report called for a national investment of up to $ 198 million annually by the fifth year. The Institute of Medicine is part of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, a private organization chartered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as an adviser to the federal government in scientific and technical matters.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday opposed legislation to make it disclose numerical ratings on how well banks and other financial institutions lend money for community needs, particularly low-income housing, small business and small farm loans. <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seger </PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s seven governors, said the Community Reinvestment Act -LRB- CRA -RRB- ratings, if released publicly, could be `` misunderstood'' as a reflection of financial soundness and `` undermine public confidence in the safety of deposits in an institution.'' Under the 1977 law intended to encourage the plowing of deposits back into lending for local needs, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and other regulators now rate banks, savings and loan associations and other deposit institutions on a 1-to-5, best-to-worst scale. Like commerical examination ratings, the <ORGANIZATION> CRA </ORGANIZATION> numbers have been treated by regulators as confidential, although on occasion they have been used to challenge and deny a bank's application to expand. Testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on consumer affairs, Ms. <PERSON> Seger </PERSON> said the ratings were designed as a `` supervisory shorthand to help us monitor those institutions needing closer attention.'' The number rating `` is in no way a self-explanatory indicator of performance'' and can be misleading, she said. Nonetheless, she said, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> could support amending the 1977 law to require it to regularly publish evaluations of each bank's community reinvestment performance based on regulators' examinations The subcommittee is considering a series of bills by Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, that would require publishing of the numerical ratings and also make banks and other financial institutions cash government checks of non-depositors and provide low-cost checking accounts to the poor and elderly. Civil rights and community activist groups have called for the increased disclosures in the wake of reports over the past two years of `` redlining'' by financial insitutions in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Redlining is practice by which banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls have used zip codes and other geographic factors to systematically deny loans to residents and businesses in areas with high concentrations of minorities or poor people regardless of their credit worthiness. `` Many lenders still do n't accept an obligation to reinvest inner-city deposits in sound inner-city loans,'' said <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> <PERSON> Cincotta </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based group that helps local organizations pressure banks for <ORGANIZATION> CRA </ORGANIZATION> lending. <PERSON> Cincotta </PERSON> said the entire rating system lacks credibility because the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and other regulators already give 1 and 2 _ excellent or good _ ratings to 95 percent of the institutions. `` Disclosing individual ratings of lenders would add to this credibility gap, and make it that much more likely that regulators would actually develop a meaningful and credible ratings system,'' <PERSON> Cincotta </PERSON> said. Trade association lobbyists have opposed <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s bill, citing the arguments raised by both Ms. <PERSON> Seger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cincotta </PERSON> as well as a claim that community activists would use the ratings to exert pressure for granting unsound loans. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> tried to add the measures to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s S & amp; L bailout bill when it was considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in April but withdrew them in the face of overwhelming opposition. The banking subcommittee's chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., endorsed elements of <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s proposal Wednesday but said he also was sympathetic to the arguments made by Ms. <PERSON> Seger </PERSON> against disclosing the numerical ratings

<HEAD>Far-Right Party's Policies to Come Under Close Scrutiny</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities are examining the policies of the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to determine whether they violate constitutional bans against extremist groups, officials said Wednesday. The party might be banned if its policies are found to be contrary to the country's charter, said Bavarian Interior Minister <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoiber </PERSON> He said the party's election rallies have been marked by `` incredible intolerance and brutality.'' The Republicans, led by former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> SS soldier <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenhuber </PERSON>, are campaigning for the ouster of foreign workers from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and for limits on the number of people granted asylum in the country. <PERSON> Stoiber </PERSON> made the announcement 10 days before a vote for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The Republicans' headquarters are in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, the Bavarian capital. Although it is running for seats in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the party rejects most European Economic Community policies. The parliament, based in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, consists of elected members from each <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> nation. The party's views have been described by critics as similar to those of neo-Nazis. And <PERSON> Stoiber </PERSON> said four of the Republicans' 20 candidates for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> have an `` extremist rightist background.'' As an example of the party's growing extremism, <PERSON> Stoiber </PERSON> quoted a recent statement by its leader, <PERSON> Schoenhuber </PERSON>, who reportedly said: `` If <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> was more aware of history, he would not have let himself be dragged into war only six years after gaining power.'' A regional Republican leader in <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> recently caused an uproar by suggesting that the party's leftist opponents be sent to labor camps. The Republicans scored major gains in recent state and municipal elections, winning 11 seats in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and seats in several local legislatures in <LOCATION> Hesse </LOCATION> state. Recent polls have predicted the party might get more than 5 percent in the national elections in December 1990, permitting it to enter <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s federal parliament for the first time. Official <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> documents until now have described the Republicans as a `` radical'' rather than an `` extremist'' party. As such, the Republicans did not fall under automatic observation by the country's top internal security agency, the Verfassungsschutz. Groups judged `` extremist,'' whether rightist or leftist, are routinely watched by the agency. <PERSON> Stoiber </PERSON> said authorities will determine whether the Republicans might be qualified as `` extremist.'' If so, and their policies are contrary to the constitution, they might be banned, <PERSON> Stoiber </PERSON> said.

 New House Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> predicted today that `` attack dogs will be curbed'' and wounds opened by the resignation of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> will heal, but his prediction was tested by harsh <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> attacks aimed at him and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` We should dispute about things of principle, things of policy that we disagree about,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` But we ought to be able to do that without turning to personal attacks or recrimination.'' `` I think the attack dogs are going to be curbed'' by the Republicans and the Democrats, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Democrat said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show He later told reporters that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> already had apologized for a document prepared by a committee aide that attacked him as a closet liberal and likened his voting record to that of Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., an acknowledged homosexual <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> communications director and author of the document, resigned at mid-day. He said he regretted preparing the document but contended he never intended `` to damage anyone's reputation. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s concilatory comments today continued a theme he pressed on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> upon taking the speaker's gavel Tuesday. `` We can not tolerate the continuance of the current distrust and suspicion and expect to fulfill the public's expectation,'' he said. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s words were meant to sooth a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> shaken by an extraordinary upheaval in the Democratic ranks, with two of the three top party officers exiting because of questions about their personal finances. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, resigned after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee charged him with violating <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules on outside income, and the No. 3 Democrat, Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, is stepping down to avoid inquiry into a junk bond deal. The Democrats plan to meet next week to fill <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s old post of majority leader and the whip's job. Republicans have moved quickly to take advantage of the Democratic turmoil, attacking <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and telling Democrats they ca n't run away from the ethics issue House Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., turned the usually good-willed gesture of introducing the new speaker to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> into a strongly worded reminder that Republicans are seething after 35 years under the ruling Democrats `` Thirty-five years of uninterrupted power can act like a corrosive acid upon the restraints of civility and comity,'' he said. `` I am all in favor of putting our House in order _ but we do n't do so by sweeping things under the rug.'' Earlier Tuesday, speaking to a Republican conference, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has been corrupted by the absolute power of one-party domination and it is n't going to be cured by a personality transplant.'' Many Democrats considered <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>'s remarks a slap at the olive branch <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> was extending. `` I think they could have been a little more conciliatory, a little more healing,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Kildee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>. A more personal shot at <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was brushed aside by the new speaker, and he said today that <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> had called him to apologize The <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> issued a paper comparing <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s voting record to that of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. The paper was headlined, `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, Out of the Liberal Closet.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> took ire, calling the document `` despicable'' and said he might expose gay Republican lawmakers if the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> continues making `` scurrilous'' attacks. He noted that Republicans have not been immune from ethics problems, citing the May 26 conviction of Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, on charges of having sex with a 16-year-old girl. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> himself said he had n't read the Republican paper and did n't intend to `` I'm not concerned about political action committees. I want to work with the president, work with the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> also promised to meet <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>'s demand for swift action on an ethics and campaign reform package _ a goal Democrats also want to meet in order to put the whole ethics issue to rest. Reps. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, R-Ill., the co-chairmen of an already-operating task force on ethics, issued a joint statement welcoming <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> also promised to renew the tradition of regular meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leadership _ something <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> abandoned more than a year ago. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> intended to join <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> today for lunch with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House. `` If there's anybody who has the ability to get us back on track and away from the tenseness it's <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> was keeping at arms length from the scramble to fill vacancies in the other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership slots Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., is considered the leading candidate to fill <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s old post of majority leader <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> campaigned for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> last year when <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.

<HEAD>Recalls, Warnings Issued for Children's Products</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A toy boat and three types of baby strollers are being recalled because of the danger of choking children, according to a government agency which also issued a warning about a type of crib toy. No reports of injuries have been received involving any of the products, the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said. Toys `` R'' Us of <LOCATION> Paramus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, is recalling the `` Toot Toot Tug'' toy boat because a metal rod could become detached from the toy and possibly pose a choking hazard, the commission reported. About 5,200 of the toys were sold nationwide for about $ 4.99, and they can be returned for a refund, the commission said. The boats can be identified by the name `` Primex-Shyf 4768.'' The second recall involves baby strollers sold by <ORGANIZATION> McCrory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has its headquarters in <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. Plastic plugs sealing the tube ends on the strollers could come loose and pose a choking hazard, officials said. The strollers were sold nationally in McCrory stores as well as by <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON>, H.L. Green, <PERSON> Kittinger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kress </PERSON>, <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Newberry </PERSON>, Silver, <ORGANIZATION> TG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Y and some independent stores, according to the commission. Imported from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, the strollers involved are Model AT410 Item 129088 umbrella stroller; Model PHT438 item 128942 umbrella with canopy stroller, and Model PHT417, item 129007 canopy stroller. Owners of the strollers should discontinue using them and contact <PERSON> McCrory </PERSON> for details of a free modification kit. Write, including the stroller's item number and style, to <ORGANIZATION> McCrory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, Dept. 06-Mail Stop 0512, 2955 E. Market St., <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, 17402. In addition to the recalls, the commission issued a warning about a crib toy called Crib Kickers made by <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Calliope </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. These toys consist of a series of polyester-filled figures such as animals and flowers, attached to a ribbon for tying them across the top of a crib or playpen. Such toys can pose a danger of strangling to children once the infant is old enough to push itself up and possibly get caught in the ribbon. A warning is supposed to accompany such toys urging parents to remove them when children reach that stage of development. The commission said a warning was included in the box of the crib kicker, but was not attached to the toy, so it issued a public reminder of the danger.

 <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> shares rocketed in early trading today in a runup sparked by a $ 10.7 billion takeover offer from <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The offer rivals a merger agreement Time has with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Time jumped $ 43.50 to $ 169.50 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> After a delayed opening, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> was up $ 1.37 -LCB- to $ 53.12 -LCB- and <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> slipped 87 -LCB- cents to $ 53.12 -LCB-. Paramount, the entertainment and media company formerly known as <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, announced late Tuesday a tender offer of $ 175 a share cash for Time. The company also filed a lawsuit in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where Time is incorporated, to block provisions of the <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> agreement that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> said were aimed at thwarting competing offers. But a judge declined to immediately grant <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s request. The Paramount offer comes 2 -LCB- weeks before <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> shareholders are to vote on whether to approve the merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, a stock swap combination that would create the world's biggest media and entertainment company with $ 10 billion in annual revenue. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, who follows the entertainment industry for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the Paramount bid would provoke `` a much lengthier battle than Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> had anticipated.'' Paramount's bid is 60 percent above where Time stock was trading before the publishing and cable giant announced in March it had reached an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. It's also 39 percent above Time's closing price Tuesday of $ 126 a share, up $ 2.75 from Monday's close. Paramount is the owner of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, whose films include the `` <ORGANIZATION> Crocodile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dundee </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Cop'' and `` Indiana Jones'' series. Its TV programs include `` Cheers'' and `` Family Ties.'' Paramount also owns publishers <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster and Pocket Books. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive, said a marriage of his company and Time would create `` the foremost American communications company, capable of competing on a global scale against foreign media giants.'' That's also a goal of the <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> merger plan. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> also owns a movie and TV production companies. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> said its board would review the proposal `` as required by law'' and urged its shareholders `` not to do anything until they hear from Time.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the company had no immediate comment. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> would make `` a superb business fit'' with <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's biggest publishing company. `` We will have unequaled strength in quality magazine and book publishing, as well as in motion picture and television production and distribution, cable systems and cable programming'' he said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said Time had essentially put itself up for sale by agreeing to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> in a deal that would wind up giving <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders 60 percent of the new company. Nevertheless, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> said it would withdraw its offer if Time shareholders approve the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> transaction on June 23. Until Tuesday, the planned <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> merger had sailed past every potential hurdle, but speculation had persisted that a bidder would emerge for Time, long a target of takeover rumors. Paramount's offer is subject to several conditions, including obtaining financing, the elimination of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s `` poison pill'' takeover defense, required regulatory approvals and ending a proposed lock-up stock swap between Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 384.7 million, or $ 3.21 a share, on revenue of $ 5.1 billion in its fiscal 1988, which ended Oct. 31. The company also owns Madison Square Garden in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knicks </ORGANIZATION> basketball team and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> hockey team, the <ORGANIZATION> MSG </ORGANIZATION> cable network. Time earned $ 289 million, or $ 5.01 a share, on revenue of $ 4.5 billion in its fiscal 1988 that ended Dec. 31. Time publishes such titles as Time, People, Sports Illustrated amd Fortune. It owns the book companies <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foresman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and controls the cable programmer <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Thousands Injured During Khomeini Grieving</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 11,000 people have been injured and many have died during three days of anguished grieving for <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the government said Wednesday. Tens of thousands turned out for memorial service on Wednesday for <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, with many voicing support for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new leader, President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>. Carrying black flags and portraits of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the crowds at <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> chanted `` Obedience to <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> is obedience to the imam of the Islamic nation.'' Iranians called <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> their imam, or spiritual leader. Buses brought hundreds of people to the city center campus early in the morning and streets all around were packed with people. The memorial service was attended by <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> and other leaders, including Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>, Chief Justice <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardebili </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>. Cabinet ministers and ranking members of the armed forces leadership also were present and a special section of the prayer area was reserved for wounded veterans of the 8-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. One man, sitting in a wheelchair, said: `` We were ready to die or the imam, but now he is dead we have nothing to live for.'' In a renewed outpouring of grief for <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the worshippers beat their heads with their fists in the traditional Shiite Moslem mourning rite. `` The imam is in heaven today'' and `` Better we were dead and you were here with us,'' they chanted. Around 100 people who collapsed in the fierce heat and crush of the densely packed crowd were hoisted over the heads of the worshipers and placed on stretchers for transfer to first aid stations. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official media said almost 11,000 people were injured in three days of mourning since <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death on Saturday, with 438 taken to hospital. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio quoted an unidentified health service official as saying `` many died'' but no figures were given. Eight people were reported dead on Monday. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, 86, died in a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> hospital of a heart attack 11 days after undergoing surgery May 23 for internal bleeding. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, considered a moderate, was voted his successor on Sunday by 60 out of 74 experts who were handpicked by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> in the early days of the Islamic revolution to handle the succession issue. But his appointment appeared a stop-gap measure to fill a political vacuum while constitutional reforms are prepared for approval in a referendum to be held Aug. 18. Iranians also will vote for a new president that day with <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, 49, barred from running for a third four-year term under the constitution. The only candidate so far declared is <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, 55, a <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> ally and leader of the so-called pragmatists in the regime's infighting between moderate and hardliners But in a show of unity, the leading hardliners, Ardebili and <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>, joined <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> in issuing a joint statement Wednesday pledging `` to work together'' and continue the revolutionary patriarch's policies. The statement called on Iranians to `` close ranks even further and watch out for probable moves and plots of the enemies'' of the revolution. The state-controlled newspapers echoed that theme, calling for obedience to <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> as the country's new religious leader. Although he is only a middle-ranking clergyman, <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> has been accorded the courtesy title of `` ayatollah'' in recognition of his new status. The constitutional reforms ordered by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> earlier this year probably will invest the president with strong executive powers in order to eliminate competing power centers that have slowed the decision-making process for years. Thousand of mourners poured into the capital from other Iranian cities to pray at <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s grave. He was buried Tuesday amid frenzied scenes of grief in a the <LOCATION> Beheshte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zahra </LOCATION> cemetery in south <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> beside fighters who died in the gulf war and in the 1979 revolution that brought him to power.

 A 12-year-old paperboy got fed up when a customer gave him a hard time, so he walked off the job _ about 10 miles off the job. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> disappeared about 6:30 p.m. Monday while he was delivering The Hour of <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION> newspaper.

<HEAD>IRS Seeking $100,000 in Dispute With Former PTL Official</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is seeking $ 100,000 in back taxes and penalties from <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, contending his $ 259,142 yearly salary from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministries was nearly twice what was reasonable. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> also contends that <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, who was second in command to <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, made personal use of the ministries' airplane and failed to pay tax on bonuses and housing allowances provided by <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. The dispute is over <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>'s tax return for 1984. He challenged the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>' assessment by filing suit in <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. In 1984, <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> served as co-pastor and executive director of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and Missionary Fellowship in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, S.C. According to <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> court documents, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> paid <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> $ 85,104 during the 12 months that ended May 31, 1984, and $ 322,667 during the following 12 months. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> calculated the compensation at $ 259,142 for calendar year 1984 and contended that $ 132,365 of that was unreasonable for a tax-exempt church to have paid. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> disputed <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> allegations that he: _ Should have reported as taxable income two payments totaling $ 125,000 from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> into his account with the Assemblies of God ministers' pension plan _ Used <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s plane for personal use almost 28 percent of the time, which <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> valued at $ 42,888 for 1984 _ Overstated provable contributiorly low-income housing, small business and small farm loans <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seger </PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s seven governors, said the Community Reinvestment Act -LRB- CRA -RRB- ratings, if released publicly, could be `` misunderstood'' as a reflection of financial soundness and `` undermine public confidence in the safety of deposits in an institution.'' Under the 1977 law intended to encourage the plowing of deposits back into lending for local needs, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and other regulators now rate banks, savings and loan associations and other deposit institutions on a 1-to-5, best-to-worst scale. Like commerical examination ratings, the <ORGANIZATION> CRA </ORGANIZATION> numbers have been treated by regulators as confidential, although on occasion they have been used to challenge and deny a bank's application to expand. Testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on consumer affairs, Ms. <PERSON> Seger </PERSON> said the ratings were designed as a `` supervisory shorthand to help us monitor those institutions needing closer attention.'' The number rating `` is in no way a self-explanatory indicator of performance'' and can be misleading, she said. Nonetheless, she said, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> could support amending the 1977 law to require it to regularly publish evaluations of each bank's community reinvestment performance based on regulators' examinations The subcommittee is considering a series of bills by Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, that would require publishing of the numerical ratings and also make banks and other financial institutions cash government checks of non-depositors and provide low-cost checking accounts to the poor and elderly. Civil rights and community activist groups have called for the increased disclosures in the wake of reports over the past two years of `` redlining'' by financial insitutions in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Redlining is practice by which banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls have used zip codes and other geographic factors to systematically deny loans to residents and businesses in areas with high concentrations of minorities or poor people regardless of their credit worthiness. `` Many lenders still do n't accept an obligation to reinvest inner-city deposits in sound inner-city loans,'' said <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> <PERSON> Cincotta </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based group that helps local organizations pressure banks for <ORGANIZATION> CRA </ORGANIZATION> lending. <PERSON> Cincotta </PERSON> said the entire rating system lacks credibility because the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and other regulators already give 1 and 2 _ excellent or good _ ratings to 95 percent of the institutions. `` Disclosing individual ratings of lenders would add to this credibility gap, and make it that much more likely that regulators would actually develop a meaningful and credible ratings system,'' <PERSON> Cincotta </PERSON> said. Trade association lobbyists have opposed <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s bill, citing the arguments raised by both Ms. <PERSON> Seger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cincotta </PERSON> as well as a claim that community activists would use the ratings to exert pressure for granting unsound loans. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> tried to add the measures to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s S & amp; L bailout bill when it was considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in April but withdrew them in the face of overwhelming opposition. The banking subcommittee's chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., endorsed elements of <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>'s proposal Wednesday but said he also was sympathetic to the arguments made by Ms. <PERSON> Seger </PERSON> against disclosing the numerical ratings

 As many as 400 wild horses and 200 deer have been found shot to death and covered with dirt near here, authorities said. Undersheriff <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said Tuesday the carcasses were found in a remote area, including a private ranch, over several months. The shootings apparently began in October and continued into March, authorities said. No arrests have been made. A federal grand jury is investigating.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Suriname </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jetliner flying from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> with 182 people aboard crashed and tore apart today near the capital's international airport, killing 168 people, the airline said. The <ORGANIZATION> Suriname </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the DC-8 went down about 4:30 a.m. -LRB- 3:30 a.m. EDT -RRB- about two miles from <LOCATION> Zanderij </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Airline spokesman <PERSON> Robbi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lachmising </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> that the plane crashed in dense fog. The airport has no radar, <PERSON> Lachmising </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Suriname </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said three of the nation's top military officers were on the flight and identified them as army chief of staff Maj. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieuw </PERSON> <PERSON> Yen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tai </PERSON>, air force commander Maj. <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Djoe </PERSON> and army chief of operations Capt. <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Salomons </PERSON>. All were presumed dead, it said. The plane had been carrying 173 passengers and nine crewmembers, <PERSON> Lachmising </PERSON> said. He said 168 people died. He said the 14 survivors were rushed to <LOCATION> Paramaribo </LOCATION>'s university hospital, but their identities and condition were not immediately known. The airline said the plane was flown by Americans and identified them as Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, pilot <PERSON> Glyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON> and engineer <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, all full-time employees of <ORGANIZATION> Suriname </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. Their hometowns and fates were not immediately known. The 20-year-old plane, which was registered in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, broke into four pieces but did not explode, and no fire broke out, <PERSON> Lachmising </PERSON> said. But <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION> radio reports quoted nearby residents as saying they heard an explosion shortly before the plane hit the ground. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pilot in another airplane, who was not identified, was quoted as saying he saw a ball of fire. Reporters who visited the scene saw burned bodies and wreckage scattered over a wide area. <PERSON> Lachmising </PERSON> said `` the accident was not caused by the plane's technical condition. There were no immediate reports on what caused the crash. The airline spokesman said the jetliner, leased by <ORGANIZATION> Suriname </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> from an unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company, was extensively overhauled in <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> about 10 days ago. Flight PY764, which took off late Tuesday from <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Schiphol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, tried three times to land at <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>'s airport, about 15 miles south of the capital, airline spokesman <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marapin </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> The weather was `` extremely bad'' and on the third attempt the jet hit a treetop, he said. At least three passengers were top Dutch soccer players of Surinamese origin, according to <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION>, a Dutch organization for professional soccer players. They were to participate in a national tournament in <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>, a former Dutch colony on the northern coast of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Nico </PERSON> <PERSON> Snijders </PERSON> identified the three as Orwin Linger, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Doesburg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> _ all of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. He said initially there were four players on the airplane but later corrected the number. A passenger list was not immediately available, but airline spokesman <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jie </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> said most of those on board were Surinamese people living in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. At <ORGANIZATION> Suriname </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>' downtown office in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, dozens of weeping relatives gathered to wait for news. <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>, a nation of about 300,000, gained independence from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> in 1975. About 200,000 Surinamese live in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. Wet terrain from recent rains hampered rescue efforts, the <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION> agency said. <PERSON> Lachmising </PERSON> said a Surinamese army unit on maneuvers near the crash site administered first aid to the survivors. Police, soldiers, and medical personnel went to the crash site, which was sealed off to civilians. State radio said victims were brought to hospitals in <LOCATION> Paramaribo </LOCATION> throughout the morning.

The subcommittee said <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> was paid $ 300,000 for his services. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> said June 1 it was resuming subsidies, under new rules, for the rehabilitation of privately owned housing used by low-income and moderate-income families. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> had suspended the program in April after the department's inspector general reported it had been mismanaged and riddled with favortism for former high-ranking Republicans serving as consultants to developers.

 Before toxic chemicals from the Avtex Fibers plant seeped into the wells of homes across the <LOCATION> Shenandoah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Poland </PERSON>'s house was part of a neighborhood. The neighbors are gone. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and his wife are the only residents left in the Rivermont Acres subdivision, living alone on a dirt road that cuts through fields between cement blocks where other houses once stood. At the entrance to the road, a home-made sign reads `` Entering Water Pollution Area.'' The Polands' ranch house was one of a dozen small homes with back yards slanting down to the river, lined with trees that in summertime blocked the view of the 65-acre rayon plant on the opposite bank. <ORGANIZATION> Avtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fibers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> bought up most of the subdivision five years ago, when tests showed that groundwater had been contaminated by viscose and sulfate bases from the plant's holding ponds. But the purchases stopped short of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s house, the furthest upstream from the plant, because it is outside the contaminated zone, the company says. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> said many of the former residents of the subdivision have died of cancer, and he is worried about his and his wife's health. He'd like to sell the house and move, he said, but most real estate agents wo n't touch the property. `` I'm stuck and I know it,'' he said. `` They do n't have to do anything about it. What makes me so mad is they knowingly endangered the lives of everyone down here. They do n't do anything unless they're forced to do it.'' The Avtex holding ponds have n't been used since the contamination was discovered and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> declared the area a cleanup site in 1984 under the industry-financed Superfund law, said <PERSON> Avtex </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>. But pollution of the groundwater and the river has continued, state officials say. At a hearing last week on the plant's violations of state water pollution limits, state and <LOCATION> Avtex </LOCATION> officials alike described the 50-year-old plant as leaking chemicals through its floors and deteriorated sewer systems. <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> T.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markow </PERSON> is considering a state proposal to fine Avtex $ 140,000 for violating its agreement to comply with state water discharge limits. From the other side of the river, few of the aging plant's problems are visible, except an occasional patch of white gleaming on the river bottom and a cloudy brown plume of water spewing into the green river further downstream <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, 49, worked for Avtex for 17 years until quitting in 1981. He says the first sign of a problem in <LOCATION> Rivermont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Acres </LOCATION> came in 1968, when a neighbor dug a well and found a smelly green substance at the bottom. The discovery led to more than a decade of official inquiries and tests of water in the subdivision. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> started bringing in his own drinking water in 1972, when his water started tasting bad. `` It smelled like sulfur,'' he said. At the same time, he started itching and having skin problems. `` The dog scratched for a week after a bath,'' he added. `` He do n't imagine things.'' In October 1981, the county health department advised residents that `` the well water in this area could be potentially hazardous to your health and you should not drink it.'' Wells in the area had been found to be contaminated with chromium, arsenic, cadmium, carbon disulfide and phenols, the department said. After the area was declared a Superfund site in 1984, <PERSON> Avtex </PERSON> offered to purchase all the plots in the subdivision except <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s. `` Mr. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s property is not within the contamination area,'' <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. `` In July 1984 <PERSON> Avtex </PERSON> did an analysis of his well that proved to be standard for the area.'' After <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> complained to the company of itching after showers, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said <PERSON> Avtex </PERSON> agreed to provide him with water `` as a matter of courtesy.'' <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Avtex </PERSON> built him a 6,000 gallon reservoir at a cost of $ 8,000 and refills it each month. Tests have showed trace amounts of various chemicals in his groundwater, but <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> says officials have told him it's not Avtex-related. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> says he's resigned to staying at Rivermont Acres. And if the Avtex plant closes, as he expects it will, he'll go back to buying his own drinking water. `` I'm just fed up with the area,'' he said. `` It's peaceful in the summertime, but it's lonely as hell down here in the wintertime. You do n't see nobody.''

 Air Force Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> cautioned members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday against increasing funds for the land-based Midgetman missile by cutting money for other military programs. `` It's simply unnecessary. There is no reason for an increase in 1990 funds,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations defense subcommittee. He responded to questions from subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, about congressional opposition to spending levels for land-based nuclear weapons. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has proposed a fiscal 1990 defense budget that includes $ 1.2 billion for the multiple-warhead MX missile, with the existing 50 missiles to be moved from silos to railroad cars by 1992, and $ 100 million for research and development of the single-warhead Midgetman. Democrats who favor the Midgetman have criticized the small amount of money earmarked for it while Republicans who support the MX missile believe the $ 100 million for the smaller <ORGANIZATION> ICBM </ORGANIZATION> is a waste of funds. Last month, some lawmakers said they would introduce an amendment to the defense authorization bill to eliminate money for the Midgetman, and Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., estimated that `` upward of 250'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members would back the plan `` How strongly would you object if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> increases the funds for the smaller <ORGANIZATION> ICBM </ORGANIZATION> at the expense of other <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> programs?'' <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. `` There is no reason,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> secretary, describing the planned budget amount for the Midgetman as adequate. On another <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> program, <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> was pleased by <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s recent assessment of the B-2 stealth bomber. The <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary had said he needed more time to study the bomber before deciding on whether it was worth buying. But after a visit last week to the Northrop plant in <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where the bomber is built, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said that despite the increasing costs, the bomber is worth purchasing. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s former undersecretary for acquisition, had recommended canceling the bomber which recent estimates indicate will cost more than $ 500 million apiece. <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> said his colleagues in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have used the total price tag for the fleet of B-2s _ estimated at more than $ 15 billion _ as `` raw meat for political speeches.'' Gen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s chief of staff, responded that the bomber is `` uniquely qualified to cover a wide range of targets'' and its development will make it a prototype for future generations of aircraft. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> also argued that the bomber is a good buy, noting that the B-1 bomber was 160 percent more than the B-52 while the B-2 is only a 22 percent increase over the B-1. On another topic, Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., a member of the panel, questioned <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> about the quality of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces estimated at more than 40,000 troops and a handful of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> squadrons could be withdrawn as a cost-saving measure `` Our presence there is not worth the $ 2 billion we're spending to stay there,'' said <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, who argued that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s high gross national product and strong armed forces makes the nation qualified to take care of itself. `` We are still an important part of the stability,'' <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> urged lawmakers to be careful about the cost issue, saying it cost less to keep the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> than to bring them back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 A young woman wanted to tell the invading soldiers they were unwelcome in her city. Thinking they would n't shoot a woman, she walked fearlessly toward their lines. They fired. She fell. A bullet wound turned her white shirt scarlet. A stranger ran to her body. Bullets ricocheted by his feet as he hauled her onto his back and carried her toward safety. The woman, bleeding heavily from a chest wound, was loaded onto the platform of a bicycle pedicab and taken to a hospital. The incident Sunday on Tiananmen Square is one of thousands of heroic acts that have marked the public's response to the five-day martial law crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. From moments of great courage to ones of quiet defiance, the people of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s capital have shown they will not soon capitulate to the army's brutal occupation. Troops continue to fire automatic weapons into unarmed but unyielding crowds. `` The people of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> will not die,'' said a worker as he stood watching troops on Tiananmen Square Wednesday. `` The people will be victorious.'' To stop soldiers from ripping their way into the city's center Saturday night and Sunday morning, citizens lay down their lives in front of trucks and tanks. At one point, a young man in a white shirt stopped a line of tanks as they rolled out of Tiananmen Square onto <PERSON> Changan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jie </PERSON>, the city's main boulevard whose name means the Avenue of Eternal Peace. Placing his arm up and palm out like a traffic policeman, the defiant youth stood gallantly in front of the tanks. As the lead tank moved right, he moved right. As it moved left, he did as well. Astonished onlookers first cheered and then ran out onto the street to rescue the man as the military convoy prepared to run him down. `` Only the people can do things like that,'' said an elderly man, who witnessed the incident. `` It shows our power.'' On street corners throughout the city, groups huddled together retell episodes of singular bravery. At the Muxudi intersection on Saturday, machine-gun fire hit a middle-aged man in the back, sending him sprawling. Bullets whipped about his body. Tear gas cannisters exploded overhead. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Min </PERSON> brought his bicycle-pedicab to the middle of the road, picked up the wounded man and brought him to safety. `` He was down and needed someone,'' said the 19-year-old after he returned from bringing the man to a nearby hospital. `` There's no time to think now about why. These are fascist troops invading my city. He's a defender so he's my brother.'' At the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Radio station on Sunday, an announcer broadcasting on the English-language service read a report that troops had killed thousands of people, mostly innocent victims. `` Please remember June the 3rd, 1989, the most tragic event happened in the Chinese capital <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Thousands of people, most of them innocent civilians, were killed by fully-armed soldiers.'' The maverick announcer was replaced by a man who repeated the Communist Party's approved version of events. Residents of the city soon learned of this last incident of objective reporting from foreign radio reports beamed to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. In recent days, as fighting has grown more sporadic, the acts of bravery have taken on a different character. Citizens escort foreign reporters past lines of troops, defying martial law orders prohibiting communication with foreign journalists. Many residents wear black armbands, mourning the dead. Daily, throughout the city, the military stages armed assaults against demonstrators crowding intersections. As soon as the troops withdraw, the people surge back into the street and reclaim the territory. At the corner of one avenue, a sculpture of a dancing girl has been turned into an makeshift memorial for the dead that fell nearby. A banner, reading `` Return the blood debt with blood,'' hangs from her neck, a black band wrapped around her arm. Paper chrysanthemums, the flower traditionally used in Chinese wakes, are scattered over the shrine. A child's drawing shows a soldier riding atop a firing tank, a swastika painted on its side. `` The people's army attacks the people,'' reads the caption. `` My sister died and I will never forget.''

<HEAD>Free Needles Essential to Stop AIDS in Addicts, Expert Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Giving clean needles and syringes to drug addicts does not promote drug use and is essential for stopping the explosive spread of AIDS among narcotics abusers, a researcher said Wednesday. And, in a strikingly upbeat assessment, a leading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health official who pioneered the first anti-AIDS drugs predicted that a cure for AIDS will be found. `` In the early 50s and 60s, there were many people who predicted there would be no progress against childhood leukemia. They were as wrong then as they are about AIDS now,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Broder </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. In an address at the Fifth International Conference on AIDS, <PERSON> Broder </PERSON> noted that AZT, the first approved anti-AIDS drug, has extended the lives of people with AIDS. A study of homosexual men showed that they had a 30 percent chance of surviving for 18 months with AIDS in 1982, but a 60 percent chance by 1987. `` I believe the widespread introduction of AZT is one factor that contributed to this,'' <PERSON> Broder </PERSON> said. He directed the development of AZT, also known as zidovudine. In another report Wednesday, researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said they eliminated any trace of the AIDS virus in a single AIDS patient who was given AZT and a transplant of bone marrow from a sister whose bone marrow type matched his. The experiment showed that bone marrow transplants could work in AIDS patients. Such treatment is unlikely ever to become widely available, however, because matching bone marrow can not always be found and because transplants are too expensive to be done on a large number of patients. Despite being cleansed of the AIDS virus, the patient died of cancer six weeks after the transplant. The study on drug addicts was reported by Dr. <PERSON> Roel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coutinho </PERSON> of the public health service in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> began providing needles to its addicts in 1984. Addicts spread AIDS by sharing needles and syringes, either because that is a customary practice or because needles and syringes are in short supply. Needle exchanges _ in which clean needles and syringes would be swapped for used needles and syringes _ were proposed to help stop sharing. Critics feared that such programs would encourage drug abuse. `` There is no evidence that the needle exchange increased intravenous drug use,'' <PERSON> Coutinho </PERSON> said. Sharing of needles among some addicts dropped from 56 percent of addicts to 16 percent in one study, <PERSON> Coutinho </PERSON> said. `` Apparely intravenous drug users are able to change their behavior,'' he said, if needles are available and if the addicts are given intensive counselling about AIDS and how it can be prevented. `` I think that providing needles and syringes is absolutely necessary,'' he said. <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> has only about 8,000 intravenous drug abusers, <PERSON> Coutinho </PERSON> said, making it much different from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, for example, where there are about 200,000. It is not clear, therefore, whether the lessons learned in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> would apply in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Preliminary results from a study of a recently begun needle exchange program in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> showed that drug abusers were less likely to share their needles and syringes and were more likely to clean them with bleach, which kills the AIDS virus. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Des </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarlais </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Substance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> concluded that the program was substantially reducing the risk of AIDS spread among addicts. A study in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> showed, however, that needle sharing fell when needles were provided, but that some addicts also stopped using condoms to prevent sexual spread of AIDS, and the incidence of AIDS infection among the addicts increased. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, needle sharing declined after an exchange program was started but 30 percent of the study's participants continued to share needles despite the best efforts of the program's organizers

 A federal judge on Wednesday gave short sentences in halfway houses to the first two defendants convicted in the Pentagon corruption investigation and said their trial had revealed purchasing practices that let consultants `` live a parasitic life off the government.'' `` I ca n't believe our government, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and executive, lets a system like this endure,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said in passing sentence on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, vice presidents of <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> was given concurrent sentences of one year each on eight counts of conspiracy, wire fraud and false statements. All but six months of the term was suspended. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> drew concurrent sentences of one year each on one count of conspiracy and three counts of wire fraud, with all but three months of the sentence suspended. The judge directed that the two serve their time in halfway houses so that both men can continue to work. They have been on leave from their jobs. <PERSON> Berkeley </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, assistant to the president for public relations at <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent company of the electronics subsidiary, said by telephone from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that he understood federal law prevented a defense contractor from employing a convicted felon. However, he said, the company `` will want to do the humanistic thing'' and would study the judge's ruling. After completing their time, <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> will be on probation for two years with orders to do 200 hours of unspecified community service. <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> was fined $ 30,000. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> was not fined. His lawyer told the court that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> had no assets except a small equity in a house he bought last year with a <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> loan. <PERSON> Kaub </PERSON> could have been sentenced to 40 years in prison and fined $ 2 million; <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, 20 years and $ 1 million. `` This trial was a window to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> procurement procedures,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` Those procedures are so outrageous that a world of so-called consultants, and as far as I am concerned that is another word for rogue, are permitted to live a parasitic life off the government,'' the judge said. A jury found the two guilty in April of participating in a scheme to hire defense consultant <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, who, in turn, bribed a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official to obtain inside information that would help <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> get a $ 24 million contract for hand-held radar-detection kits. <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> pleaded guilty to bribery charges. Both he and <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> engineer who pleaded guilty to receiving nearly $ 5,000 in bribes from <LOCATION> Parkin </LOCATION>, were sentenced to 26 months in prison last week. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said a halfway house in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> area is expected to have an opening within 30 days and the men will remain free until then. He gave <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> until Aug. 2 to surrender so that he could attend his daughter's wedding July 29. Charges against a third <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> defendant who stood trial, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnittjer </PERSON>, were dismissed after jurors were unable to reach a verdict in his case. A dozen other individuals and two corporations, including <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, have pleaded guilty in connection with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Operation Ill Wind'' investigation of military purchasing fraud. <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> pleaded guilty to conspiracy and making false statements. The company, based in <LOCATION> Newbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has paid $ 4.3 million in penalties and fines.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` disgusted'' by a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> document that labeled House Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> a closet liberal, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman said today. The author of the memo, meantime, resigned his party post. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, to complain about the incident and <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> apologized to <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, said presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` We consider the matter closed,'' he added. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>, the author of the memo that equated <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s voting record with that of Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, an acknowledged homosexual, resigned today as <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> communications director. <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> was a press assistant in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1988 presidential campaign. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who had a 90-minute lunch today with <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, had no advance knowledge of the <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> memo. `` He was disgusted by this entire incident,'' the spokesman said. He said the memo seeking to discredit <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., violated the spirit of bipartisan cooperation that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has advocated since taking office `` The issue is closed,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said outside the White House. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, R-Ill., told reporters, `` There was n't all the kind of oversight there probably should have been'' at the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> `` It was a mistake obviously from the national committee's point of view.'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said he did not know if <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> had been asked to resign. Asked what advice he gave <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, he said: `` I just said, ` There's got to be some remedy for what took place, and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, it's your shot Do whatever you think is appropriate.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the circulation of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> memo on <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> was `` to be deplored.'' However, he said the president retains confidence in <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, his former campaign chairman whom he handpicked for the party post. `` I deeply regret my decision on the <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> memorandum,'' <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said in a resignation letter to <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. But, he added: `` At no time did I ever intend to damage anyone's reputation ... the purpose of the memorandum has been misconstrued. And in that regard, I have no one to blame but myself.'' He said the memo was sent out without <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s `` knowledge or approval.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said at his first daily news conference as speaker today that <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> telephoned him late Tuesday and was `` deeply apologetic for any inferences of personal character,'' `` He repudiated the statement and apologized ... I accepted that,'' said <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. `` It's regrettable, and entirely untrue of course. I think the matter is now at an end.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> promised such attacks would not be repeated and added, `` I know of no reason why he wo n't keep that promise.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, sworn in as speaker on Tuesday in place of a scandal-scarred <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, also quoted <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> as saying he regretted any inference that the political attack was `` personal.'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, who had expressed dismay over the attack on Tuesday, called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today to voice concern, and the president was angry about the document, according to a <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> aide. One Democratic leader, Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should get involved and see that those responsible for the document are fired if Republicans want to persuade Democrats of their sincerity. `` They're playing good cop, bad cop,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said before the resignation was announced. `` Here's a a guy sent in by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to do the dirty deeds, and he calls and apologizes after the fact. If they're really upset about these tactics, all they have to do is fire somebody.'' In the statement circulated Monday, the committee said <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> was anything but the political moderate some have portrayed him as being. The document was headlined `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. Out of the Liberal Closet'' and said <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s voting record was as liberal as that of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass. While <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> initially refused to respond to the political broadside, some Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> expressed fury and <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, the top Republican in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, swiftly moved to distance himself from it. Frank accused the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> of spreading `` extraordinarily scurrilous'' rumors about <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. He said Tuesday that the Republicans had smeared the speaker with `` a sleazy headline.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> implied to reporters that he thought the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to focus on him was a not-so-subtle effort to portray <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> as gay. `` They put my name on it,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. `` It was despicable. They could have picked other liberals and put someone else in the headline.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he might reveal the identity of gay congressional Republicans if the attacks on Democrats continued. He added: `` The ludicrous part is that effort to make <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> look like an unreasoning partisan. It's kind of like trying to make a snowman dance.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> initially shrugged off the attack, saying, `` I'm not concerned about political action committees. I want to work with the president, work with the leadership of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' At a breakfast with reporters a few hours before <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> quit, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> had erred seriously. `` Sometimes you get a little too cute and obviously this is something that blew up in his face,'' <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> said. `` If I thought it had gone on in my own committee, I would fire the person.'' <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> earlier defended his work. `` It was not a smear,'' he said. `` It has to do with his -LRB- <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s -RRB- liberal voting record.'' But <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said staffers `` do not speak for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' and `` on occasion they deal in excesses.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> also referred to a column in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that quoted an unnamed aide to the House Republican Whip, Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, as spreading rumors about <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, `` It's part of a pattern where they do n't have anything of any substance to use against people to try and use innuendo and rumor.''

 Lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> Bible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Speaks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> cited principles of religious freedom in asking the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn a multimillion-dollar award to an heiress who claimed she was duped into donating money to the fundamentalist sect. The church contended in its request for review, filed Monday, that the issues raised by the case posed a threat to all religious communities, especially those whose `` non-mainstream character renders them particularly vulnerable to bias and misunderstanding, both conscious and unconscious.'' `` You ca n't unscramble so-called ` possible secular components' -LRB- for making a donation -RRB- from a combination of reasons, most of which are religous, without offending the Constitution,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Grutman </PERSON>, a church attorney <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON> of Lenox maintained the Lenox-based church's leader, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, conned her into donating $ 6.6 million to the church in 1984 and 1985 She left the church in 1985. A federal appeals court found in March that her first donations had been freely given and should not be returned. But it upheld lower court rulings ordering the return of $ 5.5 million in subsequent gifts. `` Those who run -LRB- the church -RRB- may freely exercise their religion, but they can not use the cloak of religion to exert undue influence of a non-religious nature with impunity,'' Justice <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bownes </PERSON> wrote in the <ORGANIZATION> 1st </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> decision. The case was first heard in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court after the church petitioned for Chapter 11 protection, maintaining that Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>' claim could force it into insolvency. After a judge ruled in her behalf and a trustee was appointed to oversee the church's headquarters, church leaders and dozens of followers abruptly moved out of the former prep school in <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION> Many have since settled in the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> area. The property eventually was sold to Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON> for $ 3.5 million at a bankruptcy auction. She has told town officials that she plans to turn part of it into a community center.

 Seven weeks after an explosion in a gun turret killed 47 crewmen, the battleship USS <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> left the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> on Wednesday for a six-month cruise to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Many of its 1,500 crewmen, wearing dress whites, lined the rails when the World War II battleship pulled away and several dozen relatives cried, waved and hugged each other on the pier. `` I do n't want him to go out. I do n't want him to go to the ship, much less go out,'' said <PERSON> Lucrecia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hester </PERSON>, wife of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> crewman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hester </PERSON>, cradling their 8-month-old son, <PERSON> Cobi </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Hester </PERSON> and other relatives said they are worried the ship might not be safe since <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators have yet to determine why the explosion occurred April 19 during a training exercise in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. `` It's scary,'' said <PERSON> Cherrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, wife of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> seaman <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>. `` You do n't know what to expect.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> said her husband would like to transfer off the battleship. But other crewmen were looking forward to the cruise, relatives said. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> came with his wife and two daughters from <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, to say goodbye to his son, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, who is making his first lengthy deployment. `` He's excited. We're excited for him,'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. He said his son had talked little about the explosion. `` I think he's gone through the whole ordeal real good,'' he said. `` We did n't ask him too many questions. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagel </PERSON>, wife of an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> crewman, said she was not concerned about the ship's safety. `` It does n't seem to be anything that would happen again,'' she said. The damaged No. 2 turret has been cleaned and painted and will be used during the voyage to train crewmen who replaced the dead sailors, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Goforth </PERSON>, a ship spokesman. But the 16-inch guns in that turret and the ship's other two turrets will not be fired until the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> completes its investigation. Speculation on the cause of the blast has centered on faulty gunpowder, inadequate training and a crewman who may have set the blast to commit suicide. Shipboard work on the investigation has been completed, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. The damaged turret will undergo $ 13 million in repairs when the ship returns from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. The ship still can use its five-inch guns and surface-to-surface missiles, <PERSON> Goforth </PERSON> said.

 Democrats and Republicans alike are flocking to join the <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Fan </PERSON> <PERSON> Club </PERSON>, formed to honor the `` Silver Fox'' by a man who says he likes the first lady's style. Letters from nearly 1,500 people hailing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for her no-frills, shoot-from-the-lip style have arrived at <ORGANIZATION> KGO-TV </ORGANIZATION> since a reporter announced the start of the club. `` As cliche as it sounds, she's got a spunk that reminds me of my mother,'' said founder <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>, who appears on the station's `` Good Morning, Bay Area. `` I've never joined or started a fan club before,'' said <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>. `` But the woman has her own style. She's honest and straightforward.'' Alley, a Democrat, said the club is strictly non-partisan, the membership evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. The 63-year-old first lady demonstrated the charm that attracted <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> last week when she broke into `` I'm a Little Teapot,'' complete with spout gesture, during a visit to a day care center in <LOCATION> Brixton </LOCATION>, a poor area of south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Most of the letters KGO has received mention Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s down-to-earth manner `` I especially like the fact that although she loves her husband, she does n't adore and fawn all over him,'' wrote <PERSON> Edwina </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Petaluma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, rancher. <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, resident <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said she joined the club after she read about it in a newspaper. `` I think she's very down to earth and she's not afraid to talk up,'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` I'm 81 years old and I ca n't remember any first lady I've liked so much.'' `` Good Morning, Bay Area'' has begun broadcasting segments inspired by Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, such as `` Silver-Fox Fashions,'' `` Grey and Proud,'' and one piece that pointed out that more than half the women in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are size 12 or larger. Although the show sent a tape of the first on-the-air fan club meeting to the first lady's press secretary, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not commented on it publicly.

 Solidarity plans to support progressive communist candidates in the June 18 runoff elections to build on its already stunning success in parliamentary elections, spokesmen said Wednesday. Communist officials, stung by their widespread rejection in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s freest elections since 1947, have been pushing Solidarity to join some sort of governing coalition with the party. The independent trade union has so far refused, saying it prefers to keep its freedom to criticize government policies. But its electoral dominance has severely undermined the authority of the communists and left questions about their ability to govern. The murky political situation following Sunday's election was expected to be the No. 1 topic Thursday when representatives of the two sides, led by Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, meet in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. Official voting results were expected to be issued either Wednesday night or Thursday, according to the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>. The party has already conceded a `` decided'' defeat. Solidarity was limited by a political deal it struck with authorities in April to run for only 35 percent, or 161, of the 460 seats in the Sejm, the lower chamber of parliament. Solidarity says it already has won 160 of those seats, and that the remaining seat should be sealed up in the June 18 runoffs for candidates who failed to win 50 percent of the vote, the union said. But in most cases the candidates of the communist party and its allies, who ran for the remaining 299 Sejm seats, did not obtain the requisite 50 percent in the first round of voting and will have to participate in the second round. This gives Solidarity the opportunity to choose among the communist and allied candidates those who most nearly agree with Solidarity's program. `` Our opinion is that it is worthwhile to get engaged in the second round in order to present to our voters candidates who, in out estimation, are better candidates,'' <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> campaign chief <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Litynski </PERSON> told a news conference in the capital. `` We want to give all the candidates a chance to present their platforms to our voters and we will probably arrange meetings'' to discuss qualifications of the official side's candidates, he said. The meetings would be between the already elected Solidarity deputies and those hopefuls still in the running for the communist party or the allied Peasant and Democratic party seats, he said. <PERSON> Litynski </PERSON> noted that in Sunday's elections some communist-backed candidates already had shown they were more popular with voters than others, and that Solidarity would help make such people more widely known. Endorsement by Solidarity was virtually tantamount to being elected in the first round. If the same holds true June 18, Solidarity could be able to determine nearly the entire makeup of the Sejm. According to its unofficial tally, Solidarity already has won 92 of the possible 100 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats and its candidates who must enter the runoffs generally were the highest vote getters in their districts. After the runoffs, it appeared possible the union would hold all 100 seats. Still undecided is what to do about the 35 seats reserved for prominent communist and government officials who were allowed to run opposed. All the candidates had to do was win 50 percent of the vote, but voters reportedly have overwhelmingly rejected them. <PERSON> Litynski </PERSON> and national Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> shed little light at the news conference on the progress of talks to determine how to fill those seats that are expected to be vacant. According to Solidarity, among the defeated is Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and six other members on the ruling 17-member Politburo. Solidarity has promised to allow the party to fill the seats even though its candidates were defeated. Under the April accord that made the elections possible and resulted in Solidarity's legalization, Solidarity ceded 65 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> to the communists and their affiliated groups Solidarity and government representatives held informal talks Tuesday on the issue, but nothing was resolved and the union says it still awaits the government's proposed solutions. <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> would discuss it further at Thursday's full meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Arbitration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a panel set up to resolve any conflicts between the government and opposition stemming from their historic accord that liberalized <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s election process `` We will learn there what are the possibilities for solving this problem,'' <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said.

 Troops raked a diplomatic compound with gunfire today as military convoys drove through the capital, sending more foreigners fleeing <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in fear of open urban warfare. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy's chief of security said bullets flew through the window into a room where his two children were watching television. Later, the state Department in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ordered the evacuation from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic dependents and non-essential government personnel, and urged all other Americans `` to leave at once.'' White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was chartering commercial aircraft to fly to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> for flights out on Thursday. About 125 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependents were to leave on one flight, the embassy said. Many other countries took similar steps to evacuate citizens, and more than 2,000 foreigners jammed the international airport today trying to leave. Official television late today blasted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for providing refuge to astrophysicist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, the nation's most prominent dissident who recently said he feared he would be arrested in a conservative crackdown. The 53-year-old <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and his wife and child have been at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> since at least Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said Tuesday. Sheltering <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> was `` interference in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs,'' the television report said. Chinese witnesses reported more skirmishing between rival armies on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s outskirts. At least a dozen other <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> cities were wracked by demonstrations in protest of the weekend military massacre of unarmed <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> citizens, which has turned some armies against each other. Six people manning a barricade on rails near the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> station died Tuesday when they were hit by a train unable to stop, a Chinese source said. Angry crowds set the train ablaze. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, troops today shot and killed three people, a Chinese witness said. `` I'm going home to <LOCATION> Hunan </LOCATION>. I'm afraid for my life in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>,'' said a 25-year-old construction worker at the train station. The political situation grew more confusin today, with an official media report indicating the rising fortunes of <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Shi </PERSON>, a shadowy figure considered the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s law-and-order chief. None of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders have been seen since Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> appeared on television on May 25, five days after declaring martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> are believed behind the crackdown. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration says the situation is so chaotic in the world's most populous country that it ca n't tell who is in charge, and that it appeared likely <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top leaders have left <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Major convoys of troops roared up and down <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s main streets throughout the day, with a group of nine armored vehicles including tanks and nearly 50 trucks heading east just before 11 p.m. Thousands of soldiers traveling the same route from central <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> this morning chanted, `` We love the people, we love the capital'' before opening fire. It was unclear whether the troops leaving the square were evacuating from the city or going to take up positions in the suburbs. They appeared to belong to the 27th Army, responsible for the slaughter of perhaps thousands of people during an offensive that began on Saturday to clear the city center of students seeking a freer society. Several other armies reportedly are in the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> area. Chinese witnesses said the <ORGANIZATION> 27th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> clashed early today with units of the <ORGANIZATION> 38th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> garrison, with automatic weapons about 12 miles east of downtown. The witnesses believed two onlookers died and said they were not sure about military casualties. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence reports indicate the number killed in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has reached 3,000, while a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government spokesman said Tuesday that 300 died. Although most firing appeared to be warning shots into the air, dozens of bullets struck windows facing the street in a compound for diplomats and other foreign residents about 2 -LCB- miles east of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. `` My two children were watching television when the bullets came flying through the window,'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Krug </PERSON>, chief of security for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Chinese maid threw herself across the children and covered them.'' `` The bullets just whizzed around the living room. It was damned hairy. It's a miracle no one was hit,'' the paper quoted <PERSON> Krug </PERSON> as saying. Radio <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said the troops were responding to sniper fire that killed one soldier and injured three others. `` The unit was forced to fire back, and at one time, surrounded the diplomats' apartments and nearby buildings,'' the radio said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines immediately began evacuating Americans from the compound to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Krug </PERSON> said his wife and children had gone to the embassy. A diplomatic source said not all residents could be removed before <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> troops sealed off the area to search for the alleged sniper. A Soviet reporter locked outside urged soldiers to let him evacuate his children. `` I've got five kids inside,'' he said. `` I'm supposed to be taking care of them and they wo n't let me take them out. Some diplomats reported that soldiers entered buildings in the compound. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat said, `` They're going room by room, our apartments are being trashed. Everything is being ruined.'' But several dozen residents later told an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter that troops did not enter the buildings and left after about two hours. There were no reports of injuries. One Chinese man was dragged off by plainclothes security officials who had searched the compound for the alleged sniper. Compound apartments command views of a strategic bridge where troops took up defensive positions behind trees, curbs and trucks. The national television newscast today showed Chinese reporters on a tour of garbage-strewn Tiananmen. Troops appeared sparsely deployed and tanks could be seen on the side near the imperial palace. `` Not one person died on the square,'' a martial law official claimed. The newscast also showed several soldiers recovering from wounds they said were inflicted by `` scoundrels'' during the weekend fighting. An undetermined number of 27th Army troops and tanks remained in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. Diplomats estimated 200,000 soldiers from 13 army groups had moved into the capital area, raising fears of a major battle for control of the city of 10 million. The 27th Army is closely linked to President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> and other Communist hardliners who ordered the suppression of the pro-democracy movement. Other armies _ including the 38th _ are said to be close to <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, the moderate party chief reportedly stripped of his post. Muddying the political situation was a <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> report of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> sending a telegram to <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON>, one of five members of the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, n support of measures to suppress the pro-democracy demonstrators. The report was significant because the message was not sent to <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, who was last seen in public on May 19. Diplomats often have named <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON>, 64, as a top contender to replace <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, but little is known of him. <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON> is the former head of the party <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which is in charge of security.

<HEAD>Governors Urge Long-Term Energy Policy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's governors urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday to try anew to forge a long-term national energy policy, and said it should include tax and price incentives for the development of domestic resources, even in currently restricted wilderness and offshore areas. Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, presenting recommendations of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> after an 18-month study, declared `` the nation simply may not be able to afford to permanently remove prospectively valuable -LRB- oil and gas -RRB- areas off its shores, in vast areas of the West and in the Arctic.'' `` As a personal note,'' he added, `` it is my belief that we can not afford to foreclose development in the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>,'' even in the wake of the environmental furor over the damage caused by the massive spill of the Exxon Valdez oil tanker. `` Any development in currently restricted areas can and must comply with the strictest environmental safeguards, including standards for tanker safety,'' he said. <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> noted the governors also recommended the export of Alaskan oil on a barrel-for-barrel trade basis with other nations. He said the current prohibition against such exports `` reflects the political situation at the time the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> pipeline legislation was passed, not the real workings of the oil markets or the economic realities of oil trade.'' `` I am convinced that such trades would be economically beneficial, given the high transport cost of moving Alaskan oil to <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> refineries, where much of it goes today,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on economic stabilization. `` The nation would not lose oil supplies as the result of these transactions.'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>, who was joined by representatives of the governors of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, acknowledged that `` energy issues are not a central concern to most people today,'' despite memories of the oil shocks of the 1970s. `` However,'' he said, `` I come before you ... to say that complacency is both unwarranted and dangerous.'' The trends are `` in the wrong direction,'' he said. `` Domestic oil production is down, oil production in other stable and ` friendly' nations is down as a percentage of world oil production, the concentration of oil productive capacity in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> is up, and domestic oil consumption is up. In the transportation sector alone, the nation now uses more oil than it produces.'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> noted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imported more than 43 percent of the oil it consumed last year, and the bill accounted for more than one-fourth of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. `` What is more,'' he said, `` after nearly 15 years of improvement in our efficiency of energy use, the most recent figures from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> indicate that our energy efficiency has started to decline. We use twice as much energy per unit of GNP as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and nearly twice that of our European trading partners.'' He said the governors want <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take a hard look at a variety of incentives for domestic oil and gas exploration and for coal, including standard investment tax credits on exploration and the deregulation of natural gas wellhead prices. In 1977, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed a law requiring the president to develop and send to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> comprehensive 5 - and 10-year energy plans, and to update them every two years Despite that law, said Rep. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, head of the subcommittee, `` this country has no national energy policy plan worthy of the name.'' The last plan submitted by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in 1986, totaled a mere two pages, she pointed out. Ms. <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON> said `` the nation has been asleep on energy security for the past eight years, and that is why the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill was a wakeup call for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.''

 Six days into a bloody crackdown to suppress a peaceful movement for freedom, the Chinese army has failed to pacify <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. There are numerous reports of clashes between units of the army that may be loyal to different political factions. The massacre Saturday and Sunday of hundreds of people blackened the name of an army onced famed for its bravery and selflessness. Troops once affectionately called `` brother of the people'' and `` Uncle PLA-man'' quickly were termed `` running dogs'' and `` fascists'' by citizens enraged at the killings of relatives and friends by their own army. The events in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have raised some questions about the discipline and readiness of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest army with an active force of more than 2 million soldiers. Simple barricades of metal fencing stopped tanks and other heavy equipment, breaking the drive trains of the vehicles, copies of 1950's Soviet models. Other trucks broke down in the road. The government announced Tuesday that 364 military vehicles, mostly tanks and armored personnel carriers, were burned by unarmed citizens. Tear gas used against the tens of thousands of people who came out to stop the troops had little effect. One canister that landed near an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter briefly made his eyes sting and head spin. The effects soon wore off. Communications among military units also appeared poor. On Wednesday, troops on one <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> bridge scurried behind trees, concrete fences and trucks as if an attack were imminent. The assault never came. On at least two occasions, armored personnel carriers, driven at high-rates of speed, crushed foot soldiers. Reports of dissension among commanders is adding to the chaos. On Tuesday, armies supporting rival factions clashed in front of the downtown Military Museum. On Wednesday, thousands of troops moved onto an intersection then retreated, as if preparing for urban warfare. Troops show a lack of discipline by firing randomly into crowds of unarmed citizens. Shots in the air have killed people in high-rise apartment buildings. The windows of one compound housing foreigners was riddled by 27 bullet holes Wednesday. An armored personnel carrier crushed at least seven students in a group of thousands that retreated peacefully from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. The army's violence has shocked <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents. Until the weekend, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> held an important position in the hearts of many citizens in this capital. Formed in 1927, the army was famed not only for its fighting prowess but for its rescue work during disasters and the critical help it provided to peasants harvesting crops. `` The army goes with the people like fish swims through water,'' was a popular proverb. The <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION> played a key role in the revolution. Heeding closely the order of Marshal <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> `` not to steal a pin from the people,'' the army gained the affection of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s peasantry as it battled the corrupt Nationalists, or Koumintang, and invading Japanese. Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s founder, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>, recognized this role in his famous saying: `` Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.'' But now the gun has been aimed on the common people. `` I lived through the Japanese occupation and the Kuomintang corruption,'' said a 65-year-old man. `` Never have I seen anything like this. The army comes from the people. How can it kill the people? `` <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Tieguo </PERSON>, a soldier until last year, said he had been proud to be a veteran of the army, but that turned to horror when he saw troops kick a 12-year-old girl in the chest and crush her heart. `` When I saw these hooligans kill that girl I was disgusted with myself,'' he said. `` Can these people be my comrades ever again? `` The army was one of the four pillars of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s modernization program started by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> more than a decade ago. So important is the military to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s planning that the only title he has retained is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Under <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s policies, the army has undergone a massive reform designed to turn it into a professional fighting force. It has decommissioned more than 1 million troops and purchased vast quantities of materiel from the West. But problems remain. Clashes among units of the army in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> indicate the army has failed to end the factionalism that has plagued the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military since the warlord period 80 years ago. Its seven regional armies are clearly not all loyal to the same political commanders. The quality of its soldiers also remains suspect. Official media reports quotes random surveys as saying about one-third of the troops are illiterate and say deaf mutes and mental cases have been accepted as conscripts.

 An <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> man who had n't seen his two sons since they were toddlers was reunited with the boys today, 9 -LCB- years after their mother allegedly abducted them and fled along with a religious group. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromer </PERSON>, 34, of <PERSON> Bourbonnais </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said afterward that the reunion with sons <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, 14, and <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>, 12, was `` not the happiest.'' `` They ca n't understand why they have to go back to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and why I ca n't come to <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> to join their church,'' <PERSON> Gromer </PERSON> said. He described the religious group as a cult and said his children had been `` somewhat brainwashed.'' The reunion was held behind closed doors at a State Police barracks. The boys did not comment. `` We have lots of things to work out in the next couple of months. But we're going to make it,'' <PERSON> Gromer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromer </PERSON> <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> picked up the boys for a Christmas party and fled with them in 1979 after their father was awarded custody, authorities said. She was arrested in <LOCATION> Woodbury </LOCATION> on Tuesday on child-abduction and unlawful-flight charges. The religious group with which she fled settled in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, said State Police Sgt. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Lessard </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gromer </PERSON> learned Tuesday that his children had been found unharmed near their <LOCATION> Woodbury </LOCATION> home, ending a search in which he said he spent more than $ 20,000 and traveled to 11 states. `` We did n't know how to break the news to him, so when he came into the office, we simply said ` Merry Christmas, 1979,''' said Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Division of Criminal Investigation. `` He got quite emotional. He broke down.'' A lawyer appointed for Ms. <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> did not return a telephone call today. Ms. <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>, 34, is a member of His Community, a religious group founded by <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION> in the 1970s, <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said. His Community was started as a Bible study group but evolved into a cult with strong leadership, said the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apostle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Irwin </LOCATION>, who worked with the group at its early meetings. <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said several women and children left the area when the cult moved in 1979. `` They were going to be the new exodus from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> used four aliases as the cult moved frequently around the country, settling several months ago in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said. `` In March we got a serious lead and have been in contact with <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> there,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A cryptic ad in Soldier of Fortune magazine was obviously an offer to kill for money, a lawyer for relatives of a murder victim said Wednesday in an appeal of a $ 9.5 million judgment against the magazine. But attorneys for the magazine told a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> that Soldier of Fortune had no way of knowing that a man's published offer to take on `` high risk assignments'' would lead to the killing of <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> in 1985. Her husband and a gunman are in prison. The 5th Circuit judges gave no indication when they would rule on the magazine's appeal of a jury's $ 9.5 million award to Mrs. <PERSON> Black </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, 19, and mother, <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Eimann </PERSON>, 65 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberson </PERSON>, representing the plaintiffs, said testimony in the trial on their lawsuit made it clear that Soldier of Fortune personal service ads had double meanings. `` ` High risk assignment' meant ` gun for hire' in the lingo of the magazine,'' argued <PERSON> Roberson </PERSON>, who cited testimony of an ad manager for `` Soldier of Fortune.'' <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Prettyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, lawyer for the magazine, said high risk assignment could mean gun for hire as a legal bodyguard or for law enforcement. And he rejected <PERSON> Roberson </PERSON>'s argument that the context of Soldier of Fortune _ aimed at mercenaries, survivalsts and gun collectors _ should have led publishers to believe the ad would be used to solicit murder. `` They -LRB- plaintiffs -RRB- concede that the same ad in Cosmopolitan or <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Weekly </LOCATION> would have been all right,'' said <PERSON> Prettyman </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> was shot to death Feb. 21, 1985, at her home about 90 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Her husband, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, was convicted of hiring hit man <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> to kill her after <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> placed an ad in `` Soldier of Fortune'' in late 1984. The price for the murder was $ 10,000. Black is now on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' death row and <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> is in a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> prison serving three life sentences for the Black killing and two other murders in that state. The ad <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> took out in the <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, Colo.-based magazine of the <ORGANIZATION> Omega </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Ltd offered the services of an ex-Marine and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran with knowledge of weapons for `` high risk assignments in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and overseas.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has ordered the evacuation from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> of all 258 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic dependents and non-essential government personnel and is urging all other Americans `` to leave at once,'' it was announced today. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> had protested to Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Xhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qizhan </PERSON> about several instances of rifle fire that broke windows at apartments occupied by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government employees. She said there were no injuries. `` The situation in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, is volatile, uncertain and increasingly dangerous,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. Therefore, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> `` are strongly urging all American citizens to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. On Tuesday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had only urged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens to leave the capital city of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats had been ordered to leave and they were attempting to aid other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens to get out of the country. The spokesowman said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is chartering commercial aircraft to fly to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. Two wide-bodied aircraft will arrive in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Thursday, and one will stop in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> on the way out, she said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s best estimate is that there are fewer than 1,000 Americans remaining in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, she said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy was trying to arrange transportation from hotels and other locations to the airport for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens trying to leave. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We have urged all other Americans in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to leave at once.'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had no evidence that any threats had been made directly against American citizens or other foreigners, but given the increasingly chaotic situation, it was `` prudent and wise'' to order the evacuation. The embassy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> had recommended the evacuation of dependents and non-essential diplomatic personnel to Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> early Wednesday, said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerakas </PERSON>, a spokesman for the task force on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gerakas </PERSON> said the embassy reported that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> soldiers had surrounded an apartment complex housing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats and prevented them from leaving the area for some time. `` The Chinese troops outside the residence of the staff had prevented them from getting out but that situation had been cleared up and the people were let out and had gone back,'' said <PERSON> Gerakas </PERSON>. `` As far as I know our people had gone back into the compound to pack and get their things.'' `` I can confirm that they -LRB- the soldiers -RRB- have left,'' he added. Although most firing appeared to be warning shots into the air, dozens of bullets struck windows facing the street in a compound for diplomats and other foreign residents about 2 -LCB- miles east of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy's chief of security said bullets flew through the window into a room where his two children were watching television. A senior official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the bullets appeared to come from `` the indiscriminate firing of troops who were attempting to clear <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> civilians from the streets.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had said Tuesday they could no longer tell who is in charge of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and they told Americans in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to leave as quickly as possible. `` There's been no communication from the leadership. There's no indication who the leadership is,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have mounted a wide-ranging effort _ using spy satellites, embassy intelligence and interviews with Americans leaving <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ in an attempt to determine what is going on in the strife-torn nation. But so far the chaos enveloping <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has defied simple answers. `` You ca n't make judgments based on the situation at the moment,'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said after a state dinner Tuesday night. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, his chief of staff, said the president must be careful in his pronouncements about the struggle between pro-democracy Chinese and hard-line government officials. `` You do n't want to give them the excuse, if the president says something strong, of saying, ` See, it's being driven externally,''' said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, who also attended the state dinner. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leaders appeared to have left the capital. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy has been in contact with mid-level <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials but has had `` no contact with the top-level people _ and we've tried.'' Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence reports indicate that the number of dead in the weekend attack on pro-democracy protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> had reached 3,000, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, added that the intelligence reports caution that `` hard evidence'' about the actual number of dead is difficult to obtain in the confused situation, and that the estimates could go higher. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> gave the families of the 428 American diplomats and workers at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy and the four consulates permission to depart, but the facilities themselves would stay open. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said discussions were under way with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to supplement regular <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> service so that one flight a day could carry out Americans. But <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that his airline had no plans to add flights. `` We're just operating our regular schedule'' of three flights a week, he said.

<TEXT>
 Cortisone shots appear to speed the recovery of premature babies with lung disease, helping them get off respirators significantly more quickly than usual, a study concludes. Doctors gave the synthetic form of cortisone called dexamethasone to tiny infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a form of lung disease common in babies born with immature lungs. They said that the babies treated this way suffered no ill effects from the medicine and seemed to avoid some of the complications of months on mechanical breathing machines. The study, directed by Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. However, an accompanying editorial by Dr. <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stahlman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, cautioned that studies done at single hospitals on small numbers of patients often fail to hold up when repeated on larger numbers at groups of hospitals. `` An effective and safe treatment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia is urgently needed,'' she wrote, `` but more definitive data from a multicenter trial will be required before the use of dexamethasone can be widely recommended.'' In the study, doctors gave 42 days of dexamethasone to 13 babies who weighed less than 2.7 pounds. For comparison, they gave 18 days of the drug to 12 babies and placebos to 11 others. Those who got the full course of dexamethasone were weaned off the respirators after a median of 29 days, compared with 73 days for those who got less medicine and 84 days for the babies in the placebo group. The babies getting full dexamethasone also were more likely to have normal neurological development.

<TEXT>
 A Polish immigrant who escaped the World War II Holocaust is directing a one-man effort to collect a penny of remembrance for each of the 6 million Jews killed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. `` During the war,'' said <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Starkopf </PERSON>, `` a Jewish life was n't worth a penny. In the past two years, he has gathered $ 24,000 toward his goal of $ 60,000 in pennies, which will be donated to the proposed <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Holocaust Memorial Museum in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. While <PERSON> Starkopf </PERSON>, 75, and his wife and daughter survived, he said it's important to remember the millions who did not. `` Not only to perpetuate the memory, but to alert the present and future generations who think this can never happen again,'' he said Wednesday. As vice president of the museum's <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> chapter, <PERSON> Starkopf </PERSON> also is helping direct a $ 10 million fund-raising effort in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area. But pennies make it easy to donate, even for children, he said. `` From mouth to mouth, we let our friends know about the project,'' <PERSON> Starkopf </PERSON> said. `` One woman called me to say she had 50 pounds of pennies. ... When I go down to the store with my wife and they give me change, maybe 50 cents, I say, ` Will you be so kind to give me the change in pennies?''' The donations, still in pennies, are delivered from time to time to the museum committee in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Starkopf </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pela </PERSON>, his wife of 53 years, were born and educated in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. His father and in-laws were killed at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> concentration camp, and he said about 150 members of his extended family lost their lives in the Holocaust. For a while, <PERSON> Starkopf </PERSON> said, he and his wife escaped capture. `` I looked very Aryan _ blond-haired, blue-eyed,'' he said. But in February 1942, his luck ran out and he spent five months in prison before he escaped. Later, he smuggled his 18-month-old daughter out of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> by drugging her with the help of a physician and placing her in a tiny casket. His wife accompanied the casket to a Jewish cemetery outside <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Starkopf </PERSON> left the city by another route. The family reunited at a prearranged spot and with forged identity papers were able to live as non-Jewish Poles outside <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. `` It's the only case in the Holocaust when a child was saved as a dead child,'' said <PERSON> Starkopf </PERSON>. When they came to this country in 1948, <PERSON> Starkopf </PERSON> said he had $ 3 in his pocket. Eight years ago, he retired from the sporting goods-import company he started. The daughter, <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Brainin </PERSON>, 47, is married with two children and lives in suburban <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>.

 Foreign embassies were arranging special flights Wednesday to evacuate the families of diplomats and other nationals from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> foreign minister said was `` on the verge of civil war.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> ordered dependents of its diplomats to leave the country. The embassies of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were arranging to get diplomatic and civilian evacuees out by Friday. French, Italian and Soviet diplomats said they had no plans to evacuate citizens, but the French and Italians said many had left voluntarily. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> foreign minister, said in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> the French Embassy staff would be reduced `` to the indispensable minimum'' because `` this grand and vast country is on the verge of civil war.'' An embassy spokesman, who would not let his name be used, said no evacuation was planned because `` we do n't think it is wise to create a panic by rushing people out when we do n't feel there is an acute danger.'' He said several wives and children of embassy staff members have left voluntarily. Chinese troops ordered into central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Saturday to quell a pro-democracy movement killed or wounded thousands of civilians. Indiscriminate firing by soldiers continued Wednesday. `` Due to the unstable situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the security situation is deteriorating,'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Koss </PERSON> said in announcing the evacuation order. About 125 of 185 embassy dependents in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> would leave on a special commercial flight to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and the others already had gone, he said. <PERSON> Koss </PERSON> said 73 dependents from four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulates in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would leave as soon as possible but all diplomatic personnel would remain. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said fewer than 1,000 Americans remained in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. A British official said privately the embassy arranged at least four flights to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> for embassy staff members, families of nationals and others. `` We decided it was prudent to reduce our staff,'' he said, but added that most of the passengers were Chinese from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, the British colony scheduled to be returned to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1997. About 60 British citizens left Wednesday and 61, most of them students, departed Tuesday, he said. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauser </PERSON> of the Austrian Embassy said: `` We gave the recommendation to leave the country because there is no guarantee of safety. I was not even allowed out of my diplomatic residence compound today.'' Chinese soldiers sealed off a foreign diplomatic and residential area for two hours Wednesday in what they said was a search for a sniper. Dozens of embassy cars drove out when the compound reopened, their occupants clutching cardboard boxes, suitcases and food supplies. <PERSON> Hauser </PERSON> said the 40 Austrian students, teachers and businessmen in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> were urged to leave, and those who chose to do so would join Swiss evacuees Thursday on a flight to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Non-essential Canadian diplomatic personnel and all dependents were to take a <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Thursday, said Sgt. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Riberdy </PERSON>, assistant military attache. `` There is a situation in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> which seems to be worsening and we have been thinking that we might not be able to get people out later,'' <PERSON> Riberdy </PERSON> said. He said only about 15 of the embassy's 45 staff members would remain. Japanese Embassy staff members telephoned nationals in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> urging them to leave by commercial flights or on Japanese airliners scheduled to arrive Thursday. A West German diplomat said his embassy was trying to arrange a special special flight to evacuate Germans on Friday. <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatarata </PERSON>, vice consul of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, said Filipinos would be flown out Thursday. <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Campo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Italian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said it was urging Italians to leave but would not send any diplomats home. He estimated 30 percent of about 220 Italians in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had left or were planning to do so. A duty officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said there were no plans for personnel to leave. The Soviet complement of 77 registered diplomats is second only to the Americans, with 120.

<HEAD>At Least 12 Percent of Children Have Mental Disorders: Study</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As many as 14 million American children suffer from some mental disorder, a problem that is costing society billions of dollars and depriving the nation of productive citizens, according to a study released Wednesday. `` There is a stigma associated with mental illness and there is a major problem in how children's problems are perceived,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leckman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the chairman of an <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> committee that prepared the study. Mentally ill children have historically been `` underserved,'' he said, noting that `` this is a clear and persistent problem in our society.'' Although the committee said millions of youngsters are not receiving the mental therapy they need, <PERSON> Leckman </PERSON> said the study was `` an optimistic report'' because the last two decades have witnessed breakthroughs in understanding, preventing and correcting many childhood mental diseases. The committee recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> be given annual budget increases to develop research and to train professionals to deal with the specific mental illnesses of those under 18. `` We must examine our priorities as a nation ... to ensure that these real and persistent problems no longer place in jeopardy our most valuable resource _ future generations of productive citizens,'' <PERSON> Leckman </PERSON> said. The report said that a conservative estimate says 12 percent of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s children are mentally disturbed, but that the true number could be as high as 22 percent, or about 14 million. <PERSON> Leckman </PERSON> added, `` The likelihood is that the rate is increasing.'' Of the mentally ill, members of the committee said, only 20 percent to 33 percent receive care. Some studies, the experts said, say the majority of mentally ill children are never even diagnosed by parents, teachers and doctors. `` For the physically handicapped, the evidence is that 80 percent of those are served,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Fredric </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, director of the mental health division of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. `` Yet for serious emotional disturbance, the evidence is that less than 30 and maybe less than 20 percent are served, even when they are noticed.'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said studies have shown that even medical professionals, such as pediatricians, generally recognize only about about one-fourth of their patients who are suffering from mental disorders. He said often the children who receive attention are those with disruptive behavior. Dr. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, vice chairman of the committee and a professor of psychiatry at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said studies have shown a definite increase in childhood suicides and in eating disorders. The report identified a variety of problems besetting <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s children These include developmental impairments that slow education and learning; emotional disturbances that include anxiety, depression or both, and behavioral problems that include disruptive and antisocial acts. Some of those problems manifest themselves as chronic drug use, sexual problems and eating disorders. Poverty and associated `` harsh child-raising methods'' contribute heavily to the number of troubled youth, the experts said. The report noted that youngsters with mental and behavioral problems `` may exceed 20 percent in some populations, such as inner-city children, who are exposed to severe psychological adversity.'' The total cost to the nation has not been measured, but <PERSON> Leckman </PERSON> said it is `` enormous.'' `` Billions of dollars are spent each year in direct service delivery,'' said <PERSON> Leckman </PERSON>. `` Added to this is the tremendous emotional burden carried by their families. `` Childhood depression, left untreated, may lead to suicide,'' he said. Some disorders, such as autism, may be a lifelong disability; other mental problems may lead to drug abuse and criminal behavior. `` Despite the distress and misery and great costs to society, relatively few resources have been directed at efforts to advance our knowledge,'' said <PERSON> Leckman </PERSON>. The committee said that the nation needs to invest in fundamental research to learn how to treat such children and to train specialists who can conduct research and treatment. `` There are fewer than 100 child psychiatrists who devote 30 percent of their time to research,'' <PERSON> Leckman </PERSON> said. `` The figures are equally dismal in psychology, pediatrics, social work and special education.'' The committee recommended a nationwide plan directed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> to nurture careers in childhood mental health and to sponsor research into methods of preventing, detecting and treating mental illness in children. The report called for a national investment that would grow to $ 198 million annually by the fifth year. The Institute of Medicine is part of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, a private organization chartered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as an adviser to the federal government in scientific and technical matters.

 Protest of the massacre of unarmed citizens in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has spread to other <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> cities and triggered clashes in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, according to reports reaching the capital Wednesday. Six people manning a barricade on a rail line near the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> station were killed by an out-of-control rain that ran over them Tuesday night, a Chinese source reported. Members of the crowd set a railroad car on fire after the accident and beat up 21 railway security officers, <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> radio said Wednesday. `` While trying to put out the fire, firefighters were surrounded and attacked, and the hose was ripped in many places, seriously impeding the work of extinguishing the fire,'' it said. Tens of thousands of people demonstrated in downtown <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Shaanxi </LOCATION> province, against the hardline leaders who ordered troops into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to quell a pro-democracy movement, a Western witness said. City gates remained barricaded in the ancient capital and rumors spread of an imminent invasion by soldiers, the witness said on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION> authorities said people went to factories and urged workers to strike. Local radio said city life had been `` seriously wrecked'' by the protests. In <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest city, small funeral marches in honor of those killed in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> were held Wednesday, a diplomatic source said. Many posters went up urging a general protest strike but most people did not appear to heed the call, the source added. A radio report from <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province, spoke of a continuing rampage by `` a handful of thugs.'' It said they `` smash cars, loot shops, rob pedestrians and throw petrol bombs at bookshops.'' It also said `` a number of scoundrels'' stormed city offices Sunday, roughing up 300 security officials. About 11 people were arrested and one who resisted was shot and wounded, the radio reported. It did not mention unconfirmed reports of 20 people killed in the rioting. Many cities reported that barricades had crippled traffic and threatened local economies. In <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION>, all 48 public public transportation routes were halted and Mayor <PERSON> Shang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhenling </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Changchun </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Jilin </LOCATION> province, said: `` If this situation continues, the city's economy will be paralyzed.'' Roadblocks in <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION>, a northeastern city, disrupted transport and the supply of daily necessities, causing price increases, the <ORGANIZATION> Heilongjiang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. City officials in <LOCATION> Lanzhou </LOCATION>, in northwestern <LOCATION> Gansu </LOCATION> province, issued a similar appeal, said: `` Patients and medicines can not be delivered to hospitals in time, babies and the aged have no milk to drink. Heaps of refuse can not be removed.'' <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> radio said 40,000 people were mobilized to remove roadblocks, but protesters `` smashed four vehicles ferrying the roadblock removers.'' It did not mention casualties. A statement from <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION> authorities said: `` Unless we resolutely expose and put a stop to the plots of a very small number of people, major damage will be done to production, work, and social order in the city, staff and workers will suffer difficulties in daily life, and the consequences will be unimaginable.''

 I woke to gunfire Wednesday morning. I almost rolled over and went back to sleep. The sound of guns has become routine since hundreds of thousands of soldiers rolled into downtown <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last weekend and drove student protesters from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. Instead, I dashed to a window that overlooks <LOCATION> Changan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s main east-west street, where dozens of tanks and trucks of troops were parked two blocks west of my apartment. Peering over the sill, I could see no violence: only a few dozen Chinese bicycling under a grim, gray sky, skirting torn up road dividers. But the import of the shots became clear later. Chinese authorities claimed someone had fired on the troops marching along <ORGANIZATION> Changan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> from a foreigner's apartment in the compound next to mine. Dozens of soldiers took up positions outside the compound, pointing their rifles at the buildings. Some fired at the buildings, reportedly knocking out windows. Dozens more closed the compound gates while plainclothes officials searched inside. Eerily, a loudspeaker on an army vehicle began playing gentle music. `` Do they want to fight or do they want to dance?'' asked a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> employee watching from a stairwell in the compound. The simple act of closing the compound gates touched off panic in the foreign community. Those locked inside gathered to plead with the impassive soldiers to be let out. `` I have a plane ticket and they wo n't let me out to catch the plane,'' said a European diplomat. A Soviet reporter pleaded in vain for permission to evacuate five children. A long line of cars from various embassies formed outside. After two hours, plainclothes officials collared a Chinese man who they said fired at the troops, and brought him out to the soldiers. Abruptly, they formed lines and trotted off. The gates opened, and hundreds of residents rushed to cars and vans, some bound for the airport and some for hotels further from the troop positions. All but a small group of residents also left the compound where The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> has its office and several staff apartments. `` Yes, we are brave,'' boasted a Bulgarian diplomat who stayed behind. A Bulgarian woman living two floors down from him opened her door only after much persuasion and perspired with anxiety. `` Be careful, it's not safe out there anywhere,'' she urged. More shops were open Wednesday than earlier in the crackdown, but business was slow. Far fewer vendors appeared with fruits and vegetables. I loaded as much as I could into my knapsack and bicycle basket. Eggplant and stringbeans were available Tuesday, but only cabbages and tomatoes were in the shops on Wednesday. Prices were heavily inflated, cutting into my dwindling cash supply. Banks are closed. The government warned that water and electricty might be cut if order is not restored, and I went home and filled jars and buckets with water. Gas stations closed early in the turmoil. The driver of one of the few taxis still operating said he was charging a minumum of $ 50 for the airport trip, usually a $ 9 fare. He talked one desperate passenger into paying $ 1,000, he said. The International Hotel sent guests a cheery letter Wednesday inviting them to a cocktail party with the management and hoping their stay would be `` memorable.'' But a second letter warned, `` Stay off the balconies and keep your heavy curtains closed.'' Away from the foreign neighborhood, the mood of panic eased. Most Chinese were too nervous to travel to work, but they relaxed within their walled stone homes in the narrow alleyways. Old men played Chinese chess on a canal bank, oblivious to rifle-toting soldiers who roamed a nearby alley in groups of two and three. One man called out to me: `` Have you been shot at yet?'' Two colleagues were. AP reporter <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said non-uniformed security forces marching in formation down <LOCATION> Changan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> shot at him twice as he stood outside the International Hotel taking photographs. He fled to the hotel entrance, only to find the door boarded from the inside. AP reporter <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Biers </PERSON> was on <ORGANIZATION> Changan </ORGANIZATION> further east when an army truck approached from the north with soldiers firing out the rear. He took shelter behind a tree.

<HEAD>Jurors Question Witnesses in Dakota County Experiment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HASTINGS, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an experiment that defies centuries of courtroom tradition, <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> jurors have been allowed to pose written questions of witnesses in a criminal trial. `` It made me feel a part of what was going on,'' juror <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lease </PERSON> said. `` It was wonderful. If I had to do it over again, I would have asked more questions.'' Judge <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalina </PERSON> and lawyers on both sides also said they were pleased with the experiment in the case of a man accused of stealing from his employer, even though the jurors were unable to reach a verdict and the trial ended with a hung jury. Prosecutors have not decided whether to retry the case. The experiment was part of a study being done by social psychologist <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Heuer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON>, a psychologist and lawyer teaching at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. They said about 100 judges nationwide have agreed so far to participate. <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON>, who has done extensive research on juries, was attracted to the issue of jury participation in the early 1980s when a judge in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, decided to allow jurors to ask questions. <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON> and <PERSON> Heuer </PERSON>, then at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>, did research that included 29 judges and 67 trials across <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. They found none of the disadvantages that some lawyers and judges had predicted _ that the process would drag out trials or that jurors would become involved to the point of taking sides. Instead, they found some evidence that jurors were more attentive and more confident of their verdicts. In the <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> trial, <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Misurek </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> attorney, and defense attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> agreed to the experiment. As each witness finished testifying in response to questions from the lawyers, <PERSON> Kalina </PERSON> asked the jurors if they had questions. If they did, they passed their written questions to the judge. He and the lawyers discussed whether the questions were appropriate. If they were, the judge read them to the witness. The defendant, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Haram </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Apple </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, was charged with conspiring with his brother, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, to steal from <PERSON> Haram </PERSON>'s employer, <ORGANIZATION> Brook </ORGANIZATION>'s Superette in <LOCATION> Lakeville </LOCATION> According to testimony, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> walked into the store Feb. 27 wearing a mask. The clerk, <PERSON> Haram </PERSON>, gave him money from the safe. Two store supervisors apprehended <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> as he was leaving. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> allegedly told the supervisors that he and <PERSON> Haram </PERSON> had staged the robbery, and both men were charged. The jurors asked six questions. <PERSON> Kalina </PERSON> decided two were inappropriate but allowed the other four. Two of those involved the store's alarm button, since there was some confusion over whether <PERSON> Haram </PERSON> pushed it. The jurors asked about its position and whether it is tested periodically. <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said not all defense attorneys would want the procedure used in every trial. In some cases, he said, the more information that comes into a trial, the likelier it is the defendant will be convicted. `` You want the jury to go into the jury room with a lot of questions because you want them to feel less comfortable in finding him guilty. You want them to think the state had not met its burden in proving him guilty,'' he said.

 The City Council has voted to sever ties with the local <ORGANIZATION> Elks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION>, a major contributor to its youth programs, following the group's recent rejection of two black applicants. The council voted 6-0 Tuesday to support Mayor <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON>'s call to block donations from the 1,800-member lodge to city-sponsored youth programs The lodge donated $ 24,000 last year for disabled children. `` Let the <ORGANIZATION> Elks </ORGANIZATION> know that if the financial contributions are tainted with racism, the city does n't accept it,'' said <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, president of the local chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. Elks leaders said the lodge does not condone racism, blaming the rejections of the black applicants last month on a small minority of members. It only takes three votes from the entire membership to turn down an applicant. <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Wodarczak </PERSON>, the local group's exalted ruler, noted that the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> lodge has joined other central coast lodges in urging the national Elks organization to change voting rules to admit more minority members.

 As luck would have it, the student who won a car at a post-prom party was the one who could n't take it home. <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON> is an exchange student from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gallen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. He won the 1981 Dodge Aries at an all-night, post-prom party sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Wilson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s chapter of Students Against Driving Drunk. The party last month featured music by a disc jockey, volleyball, baketball and swimming. A car dealership in <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> donated the car as an incentive for students to attend the party, an alternative to drinking and driving after the prom. `` It was very early in the morning and I was very tired, but I of course was very happy. I never won a car before,'' said <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON>, 18. He said he would have to sell the car because he does n't have a driver's license, his stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is almost over and it would be too expensive to ship home and convert to use with European gasoline. Also, <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON>, who speaks his native Swiss-German dialect as well as fluent English, German, French and some Italian, said he wo n't really need a car when he goes back to finish high school in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gallen </LOCATION>, a city of 76,000 in northeast <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> `` You could get around with public transportation and a little bit of walking,'' he said.

 An offshore intake pipe sucked up a scuba diver and pulled him 1,650 feet through the duct, depositing him at a nuclear power plant. `` I thought I was dead,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamm </PERSON>, 45, who was spearfishing when he was pulled into the 16-foot diameter, barnacle-studded pipe off <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Light's <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucie </LOCATION> nuclear plant on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. `` It was darker than any dark I've ever seen, and I tried to hold my arms in front of me for balance, but I tumbled and bounced all over the sides of the pipe.'' <PERSON> Lamm </PERSON>'s trip through the plant cooling-water system ended four minutes later in a canal at the power station, where a security guard saw him surface, <ORGANIZATION> FPL </ORGANIZATION> said. The scuba diver was shaken up and scraped but not seriously hurt. <PERSON> Lamm </PERSON> said the suction pulled off his mask and diving gloves and ripped his mouthpiece out several times as he moved through the pipe at 7 feet per second. The pipeline has no grating but a 70-by-70-foot cap suspended a few feet above the opening to reduce suction and prevent the capture of foreign objects such as fish and turtles, utility spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehalik </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` You'd have to get up underneath the velocity cap and then approach it over the intake'' to get caught, he said. The intake is marked by a buoy and is listed as a hazard on navigation charts, <PERSON> Mehalik </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Lamm </PERSON> said he saw no danger signs. `` There was a buoy nearby, but that marked the shallow water,'' he said. `` I got into about eight feet of water and got sucked down, then in.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> will investigate, said spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Horwitz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lamm </PERSON>, a scuba diver for five years, said it will be a long time before he dives again, if at all.

<HEAD>Opponents Say Long Fight Over Hazardous Waste Plant Is Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opponents have finally won the fight to block construction of the world's largest hazardous waste treatment plant after a decade of protests and legal battles. `` We're planning a party, a big party,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> lawyer who handled the opposition. The final blow for the $ 135 million plant, planned by the <ORGANIZATION> IT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, came quietly when a court-ordered deadline for appeals passed Tuesday. `` IT did not intend to appeal,'' company attorney <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Harbourt </PERSON> said. `` That's it.'' The plant would have been built beside the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Burnside </LOCATION> and next to the antebellum <ORGANIZATION> Houmas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, frequently used as a set for movies. The lack of an appeal apparently means IT is writing off $ 19 million already spent on the project, including the purchase of 1,100 acres, the development of engineering plans and other costs. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Templet </PERSON>, secretary of the state <ORGANIZATION> Deparatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION>, revoked the company's hazardous waste permit on May 8. Under law, IT had 30 days to appeal. <PERSON> Templet </PERSON> said he rescinded the permit because the company did not prove the plant would not contaminate groundwater and create other environmental problems. The permit, issued to the hazardous waste management firm eight years ago, had been challenged in a lawsuit filed by Save Our Selves, a coalition of environmental and citizens groups who said the plant would create more problems than it solved. `` When we started out, this was a state program,'' said <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>. `` State officials were involved. All the wheels were greased.'' `` Part of the game plan was to ram it down our throats,'' he said, `` make it an ` existing facility.''' The opponents successfully stalled the permit process long enough to keep the plant from establishing a legal standing. Then they won a ruling that IT violated the state ethics code by preparing its own feasibility study of the site for the state. `` We knew that if we deprived them of making a quick killing, it would die of its own weight,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Wednesday called on world leaders to seize this `` moment of extraordinary awakening'' and push ahead with efforts to promote freedom and human rights. Later, he warned Roman Catholics in affluent <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> against the dangers of `` slavery to self under the guise of freedom'' and the indiscriminate pursuit of material goods. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, on the seventh day of a Scandinavian tour, addressed diplomats in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> and then flew to Oem, a tourist center on the <LOCATION> Jutland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. There, he celebrated Mass for 10,000 people on the ruins of a medieval monastary. Speaking of what he said were worldwide winds of change, the pope told diplomats: `` Mine is an invitation to you, to all men and women with responsibility for the public life of nations, to do everything possible to encourage this moral awakening,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. He called on his audience `` to further the peaceful processes which seek to implement freedom, respect for human dignity and human rights throughout the world.'' The <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said despite this century's wars and political tensions, as well as the afflictions of international drug trafficking and AIDS, there was reason for hope. `` The world is living through a moment of extraordinary awakening. The old problems remain, and new ones arise,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. `` But there is also a growing awareness of an opportunity being offered to give birth to a new and better era.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> did n't mention specific countries, but he has previously expressed his approval of political reforms in his native <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and elsewhere. A Maronite Christian woman holding up a <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> flag and a group of Polish folk dancers were among those at Oem. About 20 Asian children pressed around the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> for blessings as he arrived. Immigrants, mostly from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and from <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> countries in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, have flocked to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s appearances throughout <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, an overwhelmingly Lutheran region. Danish Catholics number only 28,000. The pope also met priests, nuns and representatives of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> community To them he spoke of the sexual and family mores in this liberal society. He said church teaching called for `` lifelong fidelity in marriage, responsible parenthood ... reverence for every human person from the moment of conception until natural death, the equal and complementary dignity of women and men.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who has also visited <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> on his Scandinavian tour, travels to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> on Thursday.

<HEAD>Increases Reported in Anti-Gay Harassment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Violence against gay people continued to be `` alarmingly widespread'' last year, said a report released Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. A total of 7,248 incidents, ranging from harassment to homicide, were reported to the group in 1988 by 120 organizations in 38 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. About two-thirds of the incidents were verbal harassment, according to the report. The remainder were: physical assaults, 12 percent; threats of violence or menacing, 10 percent; vandalism, 6 percent; police abuse, 3 percent; bomb threats, 1 percent; and homicide, arson and `` other,'' 1 percent. The `` other'' category includes police negligence, attempted violence and one kidnapping. `` As in past years, anti-gay violence and victimization proved to be alarmingly widespread in 1988,'' author <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrill </PERSON> said at a news conference called Wednesday to release the annual study, the group's fourth. `` This report does not claim to measure the full extent of anti-gay violence and victimiazation that occurred last year,'' he added. `` Without question, the vast majority of anti-gay episodes in 1988 were not counted.'' <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, victim of one of the more vicious anti-gay episodes last year, spoke at the news conference `` because it's too easy in our world of murder and death statistics to forget that there are actually people'' behind the numbers. `` The fact that crimes are targeted against particular groups _ in this case, lesbians _ requires a societal response,'' <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON> said, calling for passage of the Hate Crime Statistics bill, which is pending in both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON>, a 31-year-old architect, was camping in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> with her lover, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Wight </PERSON>, last May when a man who had been stalking them in the woods opened fire. <PERSON> Wight </PERSON> was killed but <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON> survived, despite being shot at least five times. Their assailant, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole. The report noted a disturbing rise in the number of hate groups _ mostly neo-Nazi skinheads _ attacking gay people. `` Although most of the perpetrators of anti-gay violence are not affiliated with organized hate groups, hate groups pose an unprecedented and growing threat to the lesbian and gay community,'' <PERSON> Berrill </PERSON> said. `` Nineteen organizations representing 17 communities across the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reported anti-gay activity by hate groups last year, most of it perpetrated by neo-Nazi skinheads.'' The report also provides evidence that homosexuals are being increasingly victimized on college campuses. Nineteen percent of the anti-gay incidents reported last year took place on college campuses, the report found. Seventeen percent were classified as AIDS-related, `` indicating that hatred and blame associated with the epidemic continue unabated.'' There were 240 more incidents documented in 1988 than in 1987, the report said. It attributed the increase to a special request for information from the Metropolitan Community Churches, which have a special ministry to the gay and lesbian community, and to campus gay and lesbian organizations.

 Angry residents on Wednesday honked horns, planted Chinese nationalist flags and demanded that Chinese leaders resign during spontaneous protests of the military crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The protests broke out even though organizers canceled planned demonstrations for fear of more violence after rioters stormed Chinese banks earlier in the day. Police said five officers were injured and 15 protesters arrested. From dawn until nearly midnight, a stream of protesters converged Wednesday on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the mainland government's de facto embassy in this British colony. They shouted abuses at the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership and placed flowers for slain demonstrators. Police said they had no estimate of the number of protesters, who walked six abreast and stretched down several streets. Most wore black or white clothes, traditional Chinese funeral attire, and many carried banners denouncing Chinese leaders and praising the pro-democracy demonstrators ousted by soldiers from a central square in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> nine days ago. Hundreds of people died in the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> crackdown. Outside the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> office Wednesday, at an altar across the street, protesters placed flowers for those victims. A middle-aged man helped plant several flags of the rival <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> nationalist government on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and lamented: `` I had hopes for the Communists with their 10 years of open-door policies. But now I am disappointed.'' Meanwhile, a convoy of taxis, cars and trucks, estimated at between 2,000 and 3,000 by police, cruised past the building, honking their horns. Many had black flags tied to their radio antennas. Some groups had called for a general strike on Wednesday, and many shops in this bustling British territory were closed. Many displayed anti-Communist posters on their shutters. Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the colony's governor, left Wednesday night for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to meet with Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to discuss the future of the territory, where anxieties about future Chinese rule have increased since the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> violence. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> is to revert to Chinese rule in 1997, when a territorial lease expires. Some British lawmakers are now demanding that the accord be reconsidered. Organized protests were called off Wednesday after police fired tear gas to disperse about 7,000 rioters who hurled rocks and bottles at police in <LOCATION> Kowloon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s twin city within the colony. Police said the clashes developed after a crowd drove through the area honking their car horns to protest the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military moves and then attacked several mainland Chinese banks. About 98 percent of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s population of 5.7 million are Chinese, and two-thirds of them are refugees from mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or their descendants. People who fled to this coastal colony from the mainland, meanwhile, reacted to reports of the violence with grief and shock. Official Chinese reports have blamed the violence on rioters and talked mainly of attacks on soldiers. `` One of my colleagues received a fax describing the massacre in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and started crying. But the manager came in, tore the paper, and said it was all rumor,'' said a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> resident who had just returned from <LOCATION> Zhanjian </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province. Australian tourist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Flitcroft </PERSON>, who was at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> when the troops swept out student protesters, said he hid in a dormitory facing the square that night. `` They -LRB- tanks -RRB- crushed the whole square,'' he said. `` They just ran across like a lawnmower, crushing the tents with students in.''

<TEXT>
 A 1978 agreement requiring the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to buy cruise-missile engines from a defense contractor in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> is illegal and will be canceled, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has told a senator in a letter made public Wednesday. According to the letter, dated April 11, from then-Navy Undersecretary <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., the open-ended, multimillion-dollar agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walled </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, was negotiated by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, a consultant and a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> employee, and the former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> engineer he bribed were given 26-month prison terms June 2 for illegally scheming to help two companies get Pentagon contracts. <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON> were each fined $ 25,000 and ordered to serve two years of supervised probation after their release from prison. <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> pleaded guilty to charges that he bribed <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to provide secret <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> bid information that would help <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, obtain lucrative contracts to sell electronic equipment to the Pentagon. The <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> letter to <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> was made public by the Project on Military Procurement, a Washington-based whistle-blower group. <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Brian-Bland </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the group, declined to say how the letter was obtained. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> sought comment from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on the agreement. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s press office said it was unable to provide information immediately. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s office confirmed the existence of the <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> letter. The agreement guarantees <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> a certain level of engine sales to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. Without the agreement, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> would be required to compete for contracts with <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the other supplier of the engines. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is fighting the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s decision. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> negotiated the agreement in order to provide the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> with a second source for cruise missiles, said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustitus </PERSON>, staff director of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on oversight of government operations, which <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> heads. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> licensed some of its technology to <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> and, in return, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy at least 240 engines a year from <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>, plus 25 percent of any additional purchases up to 1,200 engines annually. The agreement `` contains no ending date and purports to apply not just to the contract with which its negotiation was associated but to ` all government contracts for F107 engines, its derivatives and associated logistic items having cruise-missile applications,''' wrote <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, who is now secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, under the agreement, must contract through <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> in buying engines from <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has been paid about $ 36,000 for each of the 708 engines built by <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> wrote. Such provisions violate a 1984 amendment to defense purchasing legislation designed to ensure competition in Pentagon procurement because it binds the government to reward future contracts, <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> was an author of the amendment. In a May 12 letter, made public by <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contracting officer, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> the agreement was n't authorized by purchasing laws in effect when the deal was negotiated The F107 engine is used in sea-based Tomahawk cruise missiles. `` The government ought to keep its word,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` The government made a contract, and under the Constitution, you can not abrogate a contract.'' The 1984 law applies only to new agreements, not to existing ones, and so the agreement with <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is within the law, <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said. `` I do n't concede in any way the 1984 law was violated by the contract even if it came after the 1984 law,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' vice president for public relations, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jolivette </PERSON>, declined to discuss the issue on the advice of counsel, saying the matter had not yet been resolved.

 The new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> laid a wreath Wednesday at a memorial to the 270 people who died in the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, and he faced angry protest from a victim's wife. <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Giebler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hasbrouck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been `` rude and cruel'' to relatives of Flight 103 victims.

After the ceremony at <LOCATION> Dryfesdale </LOCATION> cemetary, Mrs. <PERSON> Giebler </PERSON>, 26, called for an independent investigation to supplement the work of Scottish police, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and other law enforcement agencies.

Mrs. <PERSON> Giebler </PERSON>, a member of the Victims of Flight 103 group, said she came across the ceremony by chance. `` Not only is the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government not doing enough to bring the terrorists to justice, it is not keeping the relatives informed of what went on,'' she said. `` I do not believe anything has been done by the government to protect people flying today,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Giebler </PERSON> said. The chief investigator, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Strathclyde </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, has said the plane was brought down by a bomb planted in a radio-cassette player and detonated by an altitude-sensitive trigger.

<HEAD>More Jobs than Graduates to Fill Them</HEAD>

 There are more jobs waiting for the Class of 1989 from the nation's major agricultural colleges than there are graduates to fill those jobs, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said a recent informal survey showed another decrease in the number of agricultural school graduates. At the same time, more companies are recruiting on campuses. The telephone survey was done by <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, Ind. Although the number of graduates is down, the survey found an increase in the number of freshmen enrolled in agricultural courses. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goecker </PERSON>, assistant dean of agriculture at <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION>, said that the job market has been more competitive and that both employers and students are making earlier commitments.

 Flood waters slowly receded Wednesday in central and southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> after five days of storms and mudslides that killed at least 315 people, officials said. Rescue workers carrying food and medicine Wednesday reached stranded inland hill areas that were worst hit by the rains, which began Saturday night, according to D.J. Wijesundera, of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> More than 200,000 people were left homeless, including 60,000 who were forced to flee <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>'s northern suburbs, <PERSON> Wijesundera </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Kelaniya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which winds north of the capital to the sea, surged over its banks Tuesday, but dropped again by about an inch Wednesday, according to <PERSON> Upali </PERSON> <PERSON> Delpechitra </PERSON>, of the Irrigation Department. `` The waters are expected to recede very slowly,'' he said. Walls of sand bags were put up along the river banks to protect villages near <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, he said. Most of the deaths occurred in the hills and valleys of the <LOCATION> Kegalle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, about 45 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Entire villages of thatched huts were buried after a torrential downpour on Saturday triggered landslides of mud and rocks already loosed by a month-long monsoon. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Teldeniya </LOCATION>, 60 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, police opened fire on students protesting the presence of Indian soldiers on the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island. At least one person was killed and six others were injured, when students tried to storm a police station, police said. There are 40,000 Indian soldiers in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> under a 1987 Peace accord to end a 6-year-old Tamil separatist movement.

 Military officials Wednesday called off a search for seven missing gold prospectors believed trapped in makeshift mine tunnels during a landslide that killed at least 13 people. There were no more signs of life inside the shafts that collapsed on May 30 and continuous rains made further digging risky, according to Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Mariano </PERSON> <PERSON> Baccay </PERSON>, the regional <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> police chief. <PERSON> Baccay </PERSON> said five people had been rescued from the collapsed tunnels on the slopes of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diwalwal </LOCATION>, a gold-mining community in <LOCATION> Davao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION> province. Heavy rains caused a maze of tunnels on the mountain to collapse and triggered a fire that razed at least 160 shanties of miners and traders. <PERSON> Baccay </PERSON> said 13 bodies were recovered. He said 750 miners were in the tunnels at the time of the accident but most made their way to the surface through two large tunnels that did not collapse.

<TEXT>
 More than 9,000 soldiers have been unable to halt the bloody ethnic violence in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reported Wednesday. He told the Soviet congress arson and killing continued in the Central Asian republic. Soviet media reports said the death toll had reached 67 and authorities had lost control. Accounts in state-run media on the strife in the in the <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> 1,500 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said some people were stoned to death and others `` perished under the burning debris of houses.'' `` One thing is clear: the local authorities have lost control of the situation, failed to cope with it on their own,'' the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported from <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>. Vremya, the evening television news program, said houses were set afire Tuesday night in the city of <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> and authorities had received word that a `` cruel crowd of hooligans'' made an ethnic attack in <LOCATION> Kokand </LOCATION>, 40 miles to the northwest. To protect them from marauding Uzbeks, several thousand members of the <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> ethnic minority were moved to a temporary camp outside <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> `` in the steppe under the scorching sun,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Helicopters and armored personnel carriers are patrolling Fergana, a city of more than 200,000 people, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda said 9,000 <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> troops were in the eastern <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> valley trying to maintain order. Violence in the grape - and cotton-growing region began May 23-24 after a dispute in a bazaar, when a <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> spoke rudely to a fruit vendor because he thought her prices were too high and knocked over her plate of strawberries, <ORGANIZATION> Uzbekistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Rafik </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishanov </PERSON> said That incident triggered a marketplace brawl, and in later paryoxyms of ethnic violence that reached a crescendo last weekend, more than 400 houses, 116 cars, eight industrial enterprises and some schools and government offices were torched or wrecked, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Youths aged from 16 to 20, drunk or on drugs, performed barbarous, reckless actions,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It said 56 people had been killed, including many women and children, but the Communist youth daily <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said the death toll had climbed to 67. Most of those who lost their homes were <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turks </PERSON>, the newspaper said. The entire population of 300,000 <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> were uprooted from their homeland in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> by dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in 1944 and shipped to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> for forced resettlement. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, a somber <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies that authorities had the situation in the <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> under control, but that there were still incidents of arson and killings `` It has not changed for the better,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` It concerns us very much.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> joined him in appealing to Uzbeks and <PERSON> Meshki </PERSON> <PERSON> Turks </PERSON>, both of whom are traditionally Moslem, to halt the bloodshed. It was the second such appeal issued this week. The Turkish minority, which adopted Islam centuries ago, has been pressing its demands to be allowed to return to its ancestral homeland in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> since the national parliament began meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> late last month. Authorities charged with keeping order in the <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> openly admitted the situation was still volatile and ethnic hatreds keen. Despite the heavy military and police presence, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that as recently as Tuesday night gunshots were heard in several neighborhoods in <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION>. The violence was the latest ethnic dispute to erupt in the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where disputes in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> region and in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> have killed scores of people and left thousands homeless. A national outcry followed the use of chemicals, shovels and clubs by soldiers who broke up a pro-independence rally in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> on April 9. Nineteen civilians were killed in the assault, and one was later shot by soldiers for violating curfew. In his remarks to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> seemed to demand a firm but measured response in dealing with the <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> violence. `` The developments in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> show once again that we should be patient, reserved and alert and should bear responsibility for our actions in everything, especially in what concerns inter-ethnic relations,'' the Soviet leader said.

 A striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> baggage handler who says he was struggling to make ends meet tried to sell $ 250,000 in counterfeit money to an undercover agent, authorities said. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON>, 58, was arrested on conspiracy charges Monday along with his brother and two other men. They were released Tuesday and Wednesday on $ 50,000 bail. <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON>, 60, agreed to sell the fake money to an undercover agent for $ 40,000, the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said it is still investigating the source of the money. In interviews before his arrest, <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON> said he had fallen behind on car payments, sent his wife to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to live with their son and took in a boarder since the Machinists strike began March 4. He collected $ 100 a week from the union strike fund but said he went through his savings.

<HEAD>State Department Orders Diplomatic Dependents Out</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, calling the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` volatile, uncertain and increasingly dangerous,'' ordered the evacuation on Wednesday of its 258 diplomatic dependents and urged all other private Americans to leave as soon as possible. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> `` are strongly urging all American citizens to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> told reporters. `` The situation is deteriorating,'' she said. The evacuation order and the new warning to private citizens reflect a heightened concern by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government about the situation in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, as well as in the provinces outside the capital. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no legal authority to force private Americans to leave the country. On Tuesday, the department had urged private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens only to leave <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the center of the turmoil sparked by weeks of pro-democracy demonstrations. The evacuation was ordered after Chinese troops raked a diplomatic compound with gunfire and another incident in which Chinese soldiers surrounded an apartment complex housing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats and prevented them from leaving the area for some time. No Americans were injured, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` The situation in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, is volatile, uncertain and increasingly dangerous,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. She refused to describe the situation in the country as `` civil war.'' But the spokeswoman, who said a day earlier that she could n't verify that fighting among the military had occurred, confirmed that some clashes between small army units had taken place The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has chartered commercial aircraft to fly to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> to supplement regular <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline departures. Also, officials have organized transportation to help <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens get to the airports, the spokeswoman said. She said that the road to the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> airport remained open and that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials are allowing the extra charter flights to land. Two aircraft, one from <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and another from <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, will leave <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Thursday, and there is a possibility of a third, she said. A regularly scheduled flight is slated to leave Friday. Other planes will be chartered if necessary, she added. Their purpose is `` to facilitate the departure of all those who want to leave and all those who have been ordered to leave,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said she did not know the exact destination of the flights. Although the shooting at the diplomatic compound appeared to be warning shots fired into the air, dozens of bullets struck windows facing the street in the housing area for diplomats and other foreign residents about 2 -LCB- miles east of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>'s chief of security said bullets had pierced a window into a room where his two children were watching television. An administration official, who spoke on condition he not be named, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe that 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xioaping </PERSON>, who has been reported in ill health `` is still alive ... and still running the show.'' The official noted that while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government ca n't order private citizens to leave the country, `` a real change'' of atmosphere has taken place in recent days, and that `` more and more people'' have decided to leave the country. The official said that there are `` a fair number of children'' among the 258 dependents and non-essential personnel who have been ordered to leave and that officials are making sure every child is accompanied by either a parent or a friend on the flights out of the country. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said ambassador <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> had met with Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Xhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qizhan </PERSON> `` and registered a strong protest'' about an incident of rifle fire that broke windows in apartments occupied by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government employees. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had no evidence that any threats had been made directly against Americans or other foreigners but, given the increasingly chaotic situation, it was `` prudent and wise'' to order the evacuation. The Chinese government, meanwhile, notified the department that it had decided to postpone next week's visit of Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON>. `` Our government agreed it was wise to postpone -LRB- the visit -RRB- at this time,'' the spokeswoman said. She said the Chinese gave no explanation for the change of plans. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> emphasized that no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats had been ordered to leave, adding that their presence was necessary to aid the departure of other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. The spokeswoman said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s `` best estimate'' is that there are about 1,000 Americans still in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Although some 8,800 Americans had notified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in January that there were somewhere in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, `` we do not have any accurate number of how many Americans are in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'' at the present time, she said. She added that the number of Americans appears to have `` dramatically been reduced'' over the last several days as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses have asked their workers to leave. Besides leaving on the U.S.-flag carriers, Americans have also departed on other national carriers, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> noted. She said that if there are extra seats on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes, citizens from other nations will be allowed to use them.

 Politicians, security officials and the man who will supervise elections met last fall to coordinate strategies to defeat the <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement at the polls this November, a newspaper reported Wednesday. Also Wednesday, South African President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said his country would not hesitate to launch raids against an independent <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> if guerrilla attacks were staged from the territory <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled for 74 years. The Namibian newspaper, which supports the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, said the secret meeting of the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> raises questions whether `` free and fair'' elections can be held in November as scheduled under a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> independence plan for the territory. The Sept. 7 talks included Cabinet members of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s interim government, the heads of the territorial army and the police, as well as <PERSON> Andries </PERSON> <PERSON> Visser </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s chief electoral officer, according to The Namibian, which obtained the minutes of the meeting. `` It must now be worked out how to mobilize people and discredit <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> while boosting the internal -LRB- political -RRB- parties,'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Matjila </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member who belongs to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, told the meeting. <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Mudge </PERSON>, leader of the multiracial <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference Wednesday evening that no orders were issued for civil servants to help defeat <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>. The recently disbanded interim government included a Cabinet made up of Namibians from several political parties chosen at elections that <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> boycotted because they were based on race. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is in charge of implementing the independence plan, which took effect April 1. More than 4,000 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> personnel are in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to monitor the process, but their role is mostly supervisory. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> is favored to win the November elections but it is not clear if it will be able to capture the two-thirds majority needed to control the formation of a new government. The guerrilla movement has fought a 23-year bush war against South African rule. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> officials were not immediately available for comment. However, they have repeatedly accused South African officials, the security forces, and even <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials of being biased against the guerrilla movement. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> special representative to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>, has raised the matter with <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, according to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> statement. The statement stressed the need for `` strict impartiality'' in the elections. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen declined to elaborate. As part of the independence process, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> on Tuesday approved the repeal of security laws that banned the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and other anti-apartheid guerrilla organizations in the territory. On Wednesday, answering criticism from the pro-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that the action would make it possible for the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> to operate from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> issued his warning. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON> had the ability to prohibit South African members of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> or other organizations from coming into the territory. <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON> remains in charge of the territory until a new government is installed, expected some time next year. After the territory becomes independent, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said, the South African government will not hesitate to send the South African Police and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> into <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> if it appeared that the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> or other organizations were launching operations against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> from the territory.

<TEXT>
 A leader in the U.S.-based opposition to former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and a hero to the current government was acquitted Wednesday of illegally shipping explosives for use against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury deliberated a day and a half before finding <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON>, 57, innocent of conspiring and taking part in the shipment of detonating cord from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. He could have been sentenced to 15 years in prison. `` Truth and justice prevails,'' <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON> declared as he shook hands with his lawyer, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brosnahan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON> told reporters that the central point of the case was `` whether some misguided elements in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administrations had conspired to destroy freedom and democracy in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> ... to maintain a ruthless and corrupt dictatorship.'' <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON>, a Greek-born <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen and husband of a prominent Philippine woman, was a leader for more than a decade in the Movement for a <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION>, a U.S.-based group made up largely of Philippine exiles opposed to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who left the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> during a popular revolt in February 1986. Other leaders included Sen. <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who was later assassinated and whose wife, <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON>, now is president of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, currently foreign affairs secretary under Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> was a defense witness for <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> intervened in getting <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON> freed on $ 250,000 bail after his arrest in 1987. Others in her government denounced the charges and warned that a conviction could harm U.S.-Philippine relations. Prosecutors denied political motivation throughout and said they had evidence that <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON> was the mastermind of a plot to transport explosives to be used in a campaign of bombings against the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> government in 1981. Evidence included two wiretapped telephone calls from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> physician <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Taca </PERSON> to <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON>, in which the two men discussed a need to get `` 40'' and `` 60,'' which the prosecution said were references to weights of detonating cord. A letter was found in <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON>' home that referred to `` stripping the rope,'' allegedly meaning a removal of explosive powder from the detonating cord. Six hundred feet of stripped detonating cord was found in <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON>' garbage, and powder identified by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> as explosives was recovered from tools in his <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> house. The defense seized on gaps in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation, including a period of more than five hours that the garbage sat unattended after its seizure, to suggest that incriminating evidence had been planted by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> agents who were following <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON> was indicted in December 1986, just before the expiration of the five-year legal deadline, and 10 months after the fall of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Psinakis </PERSON> attributed the prosecution to an alleged promise to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, just after his election as president in 1980, to target the Philippine dictator's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foes for investigation. Defense attempts to dismiss the case before trial on the grounds of selective prosecution were rejected by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnacke </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' illness has prevented him from traveling from his exile home in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to face racketeering charges alleging he plundered his homeland of more than $ 100 million and used the money to buy real estate and art in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was described as resting comfortably Wednesday after emergency surgery for an abdominal infection, but his prognosis for recovery remains poor, a hospital spokesman said.

<TEXT>
 An Israeli helicopter gunship attacked pro-Iranian guerrillas in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after they launched a rocket into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s border `` security zone'' Wednesday, police reported. A police spokesman said the gunship fired `` three rockets at <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> positions'' southeast of <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION> at midday and at least three guerrillas were wounded. He said the attack near the mountain town occurred after <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militiamen fired the rocket into <LOCATION> Marjayoun </LOCATION> in the Israeli zone, which ranges in depth from six to 10 miles just north of the border. The rocket `` exploded in a residential area of <LOCATION> Marjayoun </LOCATION> at 10:10 a.m.'' but no casualty reort was available, the spokesman said. About the air attack, the spokesman said: `` Dust and smoke billowed from the stricken positions'' on a wooded slope on the western flank of the Israeli zone. `` Hezbollahis fired anti-aircraft guns at the gunship, but it was not hit.'' It was the sixth Israeli air raid in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. On May 31, Israeli jets raided <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> bases in south and east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, killing two people and wounding 12.

<TEXT>
 Members of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel on aging said Wednesday the federal government should do more to help states combat the growing problem of abuse and neglect of the elderly. How much abuse there is can not be documented, but only a fraction of the cases are reported to state authorities, the panel was told. `` Members want to see the national government play a more active role,'' Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> Michio </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, acting deputy commissioner of the Administration on Aging in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, at a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee hearing. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, chairman of the human services subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging, acknowledged that the federal effort has been hamstrung by lack of public awareness of the problem and cuts in available funds. funding cutbacks. But, he said, `` We're prepared to give you more resources.'' Rep. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Slaughter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, questioned how <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>'s agency could address the problem without a clear picture of its national scope, and added: `` I'm not sure a federal passive role is going to help.'' <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> rejected the description of his agency as `` passive.'' He said the office plays `` an active role in a supporting role'' by providing assistance to states. `` The Administration on Aging has long recognized that prevention of elder abuse is primarily a state responsibility and a state prerogative,'' he told the panel. But <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> and other members noted that the federal government has made many efforts to take the lead in fighting child abuse, including monitoring state activities. `` It seems to me that what would be of national interest in the younger years of life would be of national concern in the older years of life,'' he said. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said the federal agency has not evaluated individual state efforts to prevent abuse and neglect of older Americans, but is `` trying to be responsive'' to states' needs in developing programs, supplying educational materials and enhancing public awareness. Though states are not required to spend any of the money they get from the agency on protective services, 40 states do allocate some of their federal funds to these services, he said. `` States are as interested in this as we are,'' he said. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said his agency relies on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Elder Abuse to gather information on the scope of the problem and the efforts of the states. The center, operated by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Units </ORGANIZATION> on Aging and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION>, receives federal funds. <PERSON> Toshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatara </PERSON>, director of the center, testified that because the reporting systems in many states are incomplete, it is impossible to estimate accurately the extent of the problem. He said state surveys turned up 140,000 reports of abuse of the elderly last year, but he said that represents only a fraction of the incidents. One study found that only one of 14 cases gets reported, which would mean that last year there would have been nearly 2 million `` reportable'' cases, he said. `` Elder abuse is far less likely to be reported than child abuse, about which the public has gained greater awareness of the problem than it has about elder abuse,'' he said. <PERSON> Tatara </PERSON> called for better coordination of federal programs and regulations. As an example, he cited a federal <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid policy that he said contributes to patient `` neglect.'' Under that policy, the cost of a medical device that prevents bed sores is not covered, though the cost of treating bed sores is, he said.

 Two Cuban-born Republicans launched bids Wednesday to become the first from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s exile community in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s leader said the battle for the late <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>'s seat could start turning the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> tide. State Sen. <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, an educator elected in 1982 as the first Hispanic woman in the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, and conservative businessman <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, once hailed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as an example of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream, announced in bilingual news conferences they would run in the Aug. 1 Republican primary. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the 18th District contest will be tough, but he said the national party would contribute as much help as possible to the Democratic nominee. Winning the Aug. 29 special election will signal a turning of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> momentum and help spark Democrats in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, calling the region the `` backbone of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s tradition.'' `` The perception that we are flat on our backs in the region is false,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that state Sen. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, the most prominent name in a long list of potential <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidates, said he will seek the Democratic nomination. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, who had said earlier he would make a decision by Friday, did n't immediately return telephone calls Wednesday. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, 67, has been a spokesman for liberal causes during 16 years in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and his participation in a rally against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels angered many Cuban and Nicaraguan exiles. He is married to <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> writer <PERSON> Myra </PERSON> <PERSON> MacPherson </PERSON>. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> sports attorney and agent, said Wednesday that he will be the only black candidate in the race. A registered Republican, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said he was considering running as an independent. <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, married to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>, said she would continue the district's tradition of `` a leadership which has been based on a caring conscience and conservative convictions.'' Pepper, who died May 30 after holding the seat 26 years from its inception, was known as the last of the New Deal liberals. Asked if she would continue Pepper's programs, she said: `` I am not Senator Pepper. I am <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>. We have many common values and many common philosophies. We have some differences.'' She identified her priorities as bridging ethnic and social differences, protecting Social Security, the war on drugs and crime, a tough stand on <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and strong support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> called his announcement a show of his pride in his adopted country. `` I feel very proud about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I feel very proud of being an American,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. In his 1984 state-of-the-union address, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s story of coming to this country as a destitute immigrant and building a multimillion-dollar banana importing business. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> raised funds for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and formed a fund-raising committee for former National Security adviser <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. Pepper, with nationwide prestige, won every election for the district since his first in 1962, with his closest race in the past decade a 61-39 percent victory in 1984 over Cuban-American <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON>. He drew no opposition last year at age 88. The district's registration is 54 percent Democrat, down from 72 percent a decade ago. The district is a multi-ethnic mix that ranges from inner-city black areas to retirement enclaves to <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> to upscale suburbs. Estimates of the number of Hispanics in the district range from 40 percent to nearly half.

 Foreigners fleeing <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> were returning to their homes Wednesday with terrifying stories of the killings they saw and the chaos they left behind. They flew to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and other cities after several countries ordered their citizens to leave the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> capital, where soldiers have killed or wounded thousands of people in crushing a pro-democracy movement. `` I saw a soldier's body, burned, hanging from the bridge. That made me get the hell out of there,'' Australian tourist <PERSON> Jimie </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. He said people told him the soldier had killed children and women. `` We were shot at by the tanks at the Peking Hotel doorway. They were shooting at anything that moved,'' said <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, a French tour guide, after arriving in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> with a group of 40 tourists. `` I came out to the veranda of the Minzu Hotel to see what was happening and gunfire from a tank hit the veranda about 50 centimeters -LRB- 20 inches -RRB- above my head,'' Japanese businessman <PERSON> Ryoichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikukawa </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, an English teacher from <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, got up before dawn Wednesday to line up for a ticket on the same <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight. As he was about to enter a taxi in front of his hotel, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said, he threw himself to the ground because of gunfire from soldiers, which shattered windows on upper floors. `` I think it was their way of telling us to get back inside,'' he said. White expressed concern for 20 American friends, including a pregnant woman, he believed were still in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre-Louis </PERSON> said: `` There's chaos, even panic, at the airport. Everybody is trying to leave'' <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pierre-Louis </PERSON>, a 34-year-old a native of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, arrived with his wife <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> and their two young children. He said they kept up with events by watching American cable television at their hotel. `` They cut off our phones for nearly two days but for some reason they left the television on,'' he said. `` The more we saw the more afraid we got.'' <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON>, a graduate student at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who was doing research in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, said in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>: `` Gasoline is a problem.'' She said her taxi driver said he had only enough for one more trip `` and all the gasoline stations are closed.'' One American woman who arrived in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Wednesday had been in a dormitory where soldiers entered firing guns, killing a number of students, according to her friends. She was too upset to talk to a reporter. `` The airline offices were just two blocks from our hotel, but with all the tanks out there and gunfire it was too long a walk to risk,'' said <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON>. An American professor at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> was stopped along with eight other Americans in a van on the road to the airport by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> soldiers who took their baggage, money, tickets and vehicle. The group had to walk an hour further to the airport, the teacher told <PERSON> Junichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagano </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> supervisor at <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> airport, near <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Many others on <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight 925 also arrived in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> with no baggage or money, <LOCATION> Nagano </LOCATION> said. Ms. <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> told of a group of seven <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students who tried to stick together in their efforts to escape, helped by a Japanese student who found them airline tickets. But he could get them only three tickets, and `` we had to leave the other four behind,'' <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> said. `` The last we knew they were out on Changan Avenue trying to get to the airline offices, but that was where the heaviest fighting was going on. I do n't know what happened to them,'' she said. She said the lack of reliable information was the main problem. `` It was very difficult to get phone calls through. People were getting hysterical,'' said <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON>, who moved around trying to find a safe spot in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> clutching a shortwave radio to get <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> reports on what was happening in various parts of the city. `` There were hordes of people at the airport, it was hot and humid, kids everywhere, people near panic, thinking ` today I have to get out at all costs,''' she said, adding that she heard loud booms that sounded like artillery fire within range of the airport. Some embassies, under gunfire, seemed overwhelmed with the task of evacuating their citizens, leaving some feeling stranded. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> embassy made it very clear that transportation arrangements were up to us,'' said <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who said he was worried as other embassies pulled out their students, leaving him at his university as the last foreigner, with no clear directions from the embassy whether to stay or leave. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy sent a convoy to bring <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students to safety Monday, but some students, unsure whether they were safer on campuses, where army units were rumored to be preparing a strike, or downtown where gunfire was already rife, stayed behind. Chinese cheered the American convoy of a half-dozen vehicles led by a limousine flying an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag, and flashed victory signs as it wound through the city trying to find a safe route, <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> said. `` Chinese people are clearly looking to the American government and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people for support, and that seems to put American citizens at risk because the -LRB- Chinese -RRB- government will try to suppress that kind of thinking,'' she said.

 New House Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said Wednesday that Republicans are right in complaining Democrats have at times overplayed their power as the majority party, and he vowed to wield a gentler gavel. `` I think we've pushed it sometimes to the point where, while we were still within the rules, we were making maximum use of the power of the majority or the position of the majority,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think we should do that.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, in his first full day as speaker, commented in an interview with news service reporters. He specifically referred to an incident on Sept. 27, 1987, when then-Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> held open a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> roll-call vote long enough to get one Democrat to change his vote on a crucial budget bill and provide the margin of victory. `` I think we went too far on that day,'' he said. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s comment seemed to concede a point made a day earlier, when he was sworn in before the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, by Republican Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said then, `` Thirty-five years of uninterrupted power can act like a corrosive acid upon the restraints of civility and comity.'' In a wide-ranging interview, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> also said: _ He hopes to enact, before the year is out, legislation to reform <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics rules and campaign laws Such legislation probably would have to address the issues of honoraria, or speaking fees, and a federal pay increase. He said the ethics committee's enforcement process is `` somewhat awkward, to put it kindly,'' and suggested its duties be divided between two panels _ one to determine whether to bring charges, another to judge the merits of the case. But <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said he did not think <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was mired in `` a moral swamp'' because of recent high-profile ethics cases involving his predecessor, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, and No. 3 Democratic leadership official Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, both of whom have announced they will leave <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. _ As speaker, he will be a staunch supporter of civil rights and civil liberties, and will be devoted to improving educational opportunities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> He said the nation is falling behind countries such as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in math and science education, in particular. _ A combination of tax increases and spending cuts will be needed to bring the nation's deficit under control, but Democrats will not on their own suggest a tax hike <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said such a tax recommendation would be `` an exercise in futility for all of us'' since, if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sent a tax increase to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would likely `` shoot it twice and throw it down the White House well.'' _ It is time to concentrate on governing He decried political operatives in both parties who he said spend their days searching for confrontation and `` seem to want a sort of permanent election.'' He added that Americans do n't want `` to make <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> a permanent political battleground.'' Meanwhile, Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said if <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> is serious about bipartisanship he should support a package of rule changes proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> five months ago. Democrats `` totally ignored the proposals under <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s leadership,'' he said. `` There is a new leader and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> has a different style,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> `` systematically excluded the views, opinion, debate, amendments of people who disagreed with the leadership, whether Democrats or Republicans.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> went to the White House for his second meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in as many days, praising the president's willingness to consult. He said the luncheon was largely social, although a few issues coming before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> soon were discussed generally. He brushed aside Republican criticism, including a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> memo that stirred considerable controversy. Early Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> committee announced the resignation of its communications director, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>, who had written a memo titled `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>: Out of the Liberal Closet'' that compared <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s voting record to that of Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, an acknowledged homosexual. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president had been `` disgusted by this entire incident'' and had called <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> who had telephoned <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> to apologize. `` He repudiated the statement and apologized,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> told reporters at the Capitol. `` I accepted that,'' along with a promise that such attacks would not recur. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> was sworn in as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s 49th speaker on Tuesday to replace <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who stepped down after the ethics committee lodged charges of financial impropriety. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> GOP Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., went to the White House for lunch with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> sought to focus attention on legislative matters the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is taking up or will soon consider <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> called the meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a sign of a budding cooperative spirit between the executive and legislative branches and between the parties. `` The president is seeking opinions,'' he said, specifically referring to clean air legislation. `` It's another example of this president's willingness to consult fully.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> also sought to refocus attention on the Democratic agenda of social issues, mentioning child care, health care, and an increase in the minimum wage. `` That's what the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people elected the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to address,'' he said. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> appointed Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., to be acting majority leader until next Wednesday, when the Democrats will fill the No 2 leadership post as well as the No. 3 slot of majority whip. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., is favored to replace <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> as majority leader, but is opposed by Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga There is a three-way race for whip, the post <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> is vacating because of his own ethics controversy.

 East German police broke up a pro-democracy demonstration Wednesday and arrested more than 120 people protesting alleged election fraud by communist authorities. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter saw massive security forces move against about 300 demonstrators, many carrying banners, outside a church in downtown <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The demonstration was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, and the protesters were mostly young people and students. The group planned to march from <ORGANIZATION> Sophie </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to the government headquarters to deliver a petition protesting the alleged election fraud, church sources said. The protesters accused communist authorities of election fraud during the May 7 nationwide municipal elections. Only unopposed Communist Party candidates ran, and church officials say authorities did not report all the `` no'' votes. Security forces tried to prevent Western reporters from filming the demonstration, hit some of them and ordered them to leave the area around the church. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Passauer </PERSON>, a priest in the church, said he had been promised by authorities that the 120 arrested would be released during the night after their names had been taken down. Church sources also said police arrested 16 people carrying flowers and wreaths to on the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> late Tuesday to protest the military attack on unarmed citizens in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The protesters were charged with disorderly conduct and threatening public order. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is one of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most rigidly controlled societies, and its state-run media have expressed support for the military crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>GAO Says Military Using Consultants for Wide Range of Services</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Congressional investigators said Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is relying on outside consultants rather than its own personnel to determine the cost of the $ 6.8 billion system of rail-garrison MX missiles. Officials from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, an investigating arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel that the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> use consultants for a wide range of services. The total number, however, is likely higher than the agency found because the definition of consultant varies and many contractors do not report whether consultants worked on certain programs, investigators said. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on investigations, responding to last summer's `` Operation Ill Wind'' investigation of military purchasing fraud, had asked the agency to look into the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s use of consultants. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> studied one weapon system from each of the three services _ the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 3.2 billion Fiber Optic Guided Missile program; the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s V-22 Osprey, a $ 26 billion tilt-rotor aircraft program, and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s system to deploy the land-based, nuclear MX missile on railroad cars. The Ballistic Systems Division, which manages the MX program, awarded 15 contracts worth about $ 99 million for support services during fiscal 1987 and 1988, said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, director of manpower issues in the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> national security and international affairs division. The support contractors provided cost estimates, reviews of contractor logistic support plans and helped determine system and component specifications. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report prompted Rep. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the subcommittee, to question who estimates the cost of the MX rail-garrison _ the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> or the consultants hired by the service `` The best we can tell it's the consultants that they have hired do the estimating. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reviews and approves,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` Who are the experts _ the consultants or the people we have in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>?'' <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has told the agency that `` the contractor in this case has the institutional memory and the expertise.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat also expressed dismay over the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s inability to keep track of the consultants, the absence of a specific definition of the term consultant and the possibility that these problems could result in incidents of conflict-of-interest. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burman </PERSON>, deputy administrator and acting administrator in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, said his agency has come up with a policy letter on conflict-of-interest that will require a 60-day comment period. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON> was angered by the absence of a tracking system for consultants. `` What in God's name is so difficult? Why is this a hot potato that when we ask the question we can not get an answer? Is the bureaucracy that great?'' <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON> said, his voice rising. `` You categorize, you prioritize, you have certain numbers of people working for the government. You have a defense industry you're in touch with everyday. Do n't they have an obligation to give to you the proper information with regard to that question. I want to know. I have a right to know. The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have a right to know. Why ca n't I get that from you?'' the congressman said. <PERSON> Burman </PERSON> said that with the number of broad categories it is difficult for consultants looking at those categories to determine whether they are part of the process. `` It's very difficult for us to get any kind of consistency,'' he said. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON>, acting director of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> for the past two years, told <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON> that there is `` no incentive to report this information because what happens if they do n't report it.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday he will nominate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deland </PERSON>, regional administrator in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, as chairman of the president's Council on Environmental Quality The selection of <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION>, a 47-year-old lawyer who has gained a reputation as a strong enforcer of environmental laws, brought praise from several environmental groups. The three-member council was established in 1970 to advise the president on environmental matters and has few statutory powers. One of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administraion's first acts was a drastic cut in the council's staff, and the council did little in the eight years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Deland </PERSON> is a first rate environmentalist and I think he's an outstanding choice,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hair </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> `` The bigger question is whether or not the president will give him both the resources and the respect in order to revitalize, rebuild and redirect the <ORGANIZATION> CEQ </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> has been mentioned as a possible Republican gubernatorial candidate in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and was considered a leading candidate for the job of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator earlier this year. Since his appointment in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in 1983, he has found himself at odds with <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters several times for his aggressive pro-environmental positions, notably on the question of whether it would be safe to drill for oil and gas off the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> coast. During last year's presidential race, <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> added fuel to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign's attack on Democratic opponent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for failing as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor to clean up <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. But while <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for delaying the cleanup, he acknowleged that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> under the Republican administration also shared the blame. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took reporters on a boatride through the polluted harbor, <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> refused to go along. In another clash with the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> state administration, <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> blocked the development of a shopping mall in <LOCATION> Attleboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, arguing the complex would destroy environmentally important wetlands. <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> also clashed with then <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, now White House chief of staff, over a proposed development on that state's <LOCATION> Loon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>. Since then, <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> has supported a proposed moratorium on new development on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> is a very strong environmentalist'' whose selection is `` very much a positive step,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> and other environmenalists said it was too early to tell whether the council, which wielded considerable clout in the late 1970s under President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, would regain influence. `` I assume he -LRB- <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> -RRB- would not have taken the job if he had not had some assurances of what the <ORGANIZATION> CEQ </ORGANIZATION>'s authority would be,'' said <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>. The council's influence largely will be `` a question of staffing and money,'' he added. <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> is a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colege </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. He worked for the president of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>, on the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal staff and as a private consultant before being named regional administrator for EPA. Unsuccessful back surgery several years ago forces him to rely on a wheelchair most of the time. The president has not announced his choices for the other two council positions.

 Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said Wednesday the government will make huge cuts in military spending, spur the economy and provide help for the nearly 40 million Soviet citizens who live in poverty. He also said the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> cost the treasury the equivalent of $ 8 billion a year. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was involved in the war for nine years and completed its withdrawal Feb. 15. Speaking to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies after being reappointed premier by the smaller Supreme Soviet legislature, <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said the government would reduce defense spending by 33 percent to 50 percent by 1995. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> spends 77.3 billion rubles on defense, the equivalent of $ 118 billion a year at the official exchange rate. That is almost four times the amount previously acknowledged. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, premier since September 1985, gave the first public breakdown of that spending. He said the equivalent of $ 49.7 billion is earmarked for arms and equipment purchases; $ 23.4 billion for research and development; $ 30.8 billion for maintenance of the army and navy; $ 7 billion for development of the armed forces; $ 3.5 billion for pensions and $ 3.5 billion for other needs. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> also promised pensions would be increased next year for 20 million retirees, with the new minimum pension raised to 70 rubles, the equivalent of $ 107 a month. Some retirees now barely survive on as little as 30 rubles, $ 45 a month. `` The government is aware that almost 40 million people are now living below the poverty line,'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said, which he defined as an income of 75 rubles, the equivalent of $ 114 a month or less. Explaining why the economic crisis seems to have worsened during his four-year tenure, he said that among many other factors, the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident cost the country 8 billion rubles and the Soviets' 8 -LCB- - year involvement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> 5 billion rubles yearly, the equivalent of $ 8 billion He told deputies the `` iceberg of colossal problems and difficulties'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> inherited in 1985 `` could not be melted in four years even by the most active restructuring.'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said social reform also would include abolition of special medical care for privileged officials, including the celebrated <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s Chief Fourth Directorate that provides service to top party and government figures. Earlier, <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> was bombarded with questions for more than two hours as Soviet lawmakers took advantage of their newly won right to call <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leaders to account for the country's economic and environmental woes. Before political reforms championed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> went into effect last fall, the old Supreme Soviet legislature was a rubber-stamp body that meekly listened to speeches by top state and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials and ratified any measure put before it. But lawmakers grilled <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> on issues ranging from consumer goods shortages to the state bureaucracy in charge of the chronically ailing farm sector. In other legislative action Wednesday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rejected an attempt by several lawmakers to name maverick Communist leader <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> head of a government watchdog agency in place of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s own choice. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had proposed <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolbin </PERSON>, party chief of the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, to head the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees government planning and spending. But a parade of Supreme Soviet deputies took the floor to propose <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> for the job. They praised <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s reputation for independence and battling corruption, which they said made him better suited for the post. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, however, insisted on his constitutional right to name his own candidate, subject to the legislature's consent. After permitting more than an hour of debate, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> moved to cut off further discussion and forced a vote that resulted in overwhelming confirmation of <LOCATION> Kolbin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the session earlier he and <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> had already discussed <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s role in the Supreme Soviet and settled upon the chairmanship of an important committee on construction and architecture. In the question-and-answer session before the vote on <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, Siberian deputy <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Komarov </PERSON> commented that <PERSON> Gosagroprom </PERSON>, an agricultural superministry created at the start of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and abolished in March, worked so inefficiently that `` people were saying it was the most successful action by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> against the Soviet economy. Deputy <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Miloserdny </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> heads for short-sightedness that he said led to `` the disappearance from sale of the most basic consumer goods.'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> conceded `` some specific mistakes that had a negative effect on the economy.'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> was elevated to the Politburo shortly after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power in March 1985, and captured public attention last December when he headed a Politburo commission overseeing relief efforts for victims of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s earthquake. More recently, <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> has come under criticism from some deputies who blame him for the country's environmental problems. Deputy <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Yablokov </PERSON>, a biologist elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by Moscow-based research institutes, called <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> an `` ecological illiterate'' at a news conference last month. In other business Wednesday, the Supreme Soviet chose <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Smolentsev </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> of the Russian federation, as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and reappointed <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Sukharev </PERSON> general prosecutor.

Also Wednesday, a Palestinian suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was hacked to death with a hatchet and his naked body chained from an electricity pole in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army confirmed the slaying and said police were investigating. The dead man was identified as 30-year-old <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ras </PERSON>, the 48th suspected collaborator killed by fellow Arabs since the uprising began. At least 509 Palestinians have been killed since uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> began in December 1987. Twenty-two Israelis also have died in the violence. In an unusual move, the army invited reporters to this <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> village of 13,000 to witness a house demolition. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and human rights organizations have condemned house demolitions, saying they constitute collective punishment and deny people due process. According to the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq-Law </PERSON> in the Service of Man human rights group on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the army has destroyed or sealed more than 330 houses in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and 58 in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> since the start of the uprising. Army spokesman Lt. Col. <PERSON> Hanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said the army wanted to publicize the action so `` they -LRB- Palestinians -RRB- will see and fear.'' The home was the residence of 17-year-old <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaaban </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukasi </PERSON>, who was convicted in a military court of leading Molotov cocktail attacks on Israeli troops in a nearby refugee camp, <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. No one was injured in the attacks, he said. A deafening explosion sent debris flying high in the air and showered the rocks that held the tin roof on neighboring houses. The owners of several nearby houses said their windows were shattered by the blast and debris. The house, which was home to 17 people, was reduced to rubble in a matter of seconds. <PERSON> Mukasi </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Shaaban </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that destroying his house was `` a crime.'' `` If they think by demolishing my house they will scare me, then they are dealing with the wrong person,'' he said. He added: `` I am going to live in a tent. I will continue my fight.'' The army also bulldozed the <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lahia </LOCATION> home of 19-year-old <PERSON> Akilan </PERSON> <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bamilat </PERSON>, who also was convicted in the firebomb attacks, <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. Reporters were not invited to watch the bulldozing. The house demolitions came as the army confined the 700,000 Palestinians of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to their homes for the fourth straight day. Israeli troops shot and wounded 15 Palestinians during clashes Wednesday in the occupied territories, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. One of the injured, a 19-year-old from <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, was in critical condition with a bullet wound in the head, hospital officials said. The army said it was checking the reports. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, a confrontation between a Jewish settler and several <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> women kicked off a melee that ended when an Arab-driven car crashed, seriously injuring the driver and hurting a passenger. The settler, <PERSON> Anat </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that `` There was a group of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> women who cursed us, so I asked them to apologize. They refused, and I hit one.'' Nearby, the Arab-driven car turned around. Settlers told the radio it attempted to run Ms. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> down, but <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> said the driver lost control when he was hit by rubber bullets fired by a soldier. Ms. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> was struck by the car, treated for minor leg bruises and released. In the town of <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> to the north, masked <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths seriously injured a 45-year-old Palestinian woman and her 17-year-old daughter who were accused of aiding Israeli authorities. The women were beaten with clubs and chains and stabbed with a knife, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said.

<HEAD>US Embassy Will Stop Issuing Visas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it will stop issuing visas because results of May 7 elections were not respected. Non-immigrant visas will not be issued after Friday, an embassy statement said. Immigrant visas will be processed through July, it said. `` These measures were considered necessary because the regime of -LRB- Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> brutally ignored the will freely expressed by the Panamanian people,'' an embassy statement said. It said the visa service was being stopped so embassy consular personnel could use their time `` to protect the interests of <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> citizens.'' Panamanians and others who need visas for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will have to obtain them in consulates in third countries, it said. The embassy will continue to issue visas for other foreign diplomats in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, it said. International observers say <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> is the country's de facto leader, rigged the election in support of his candidate, then ordered its results annulled when the fraud became obvious. The three opposition presidential and vice presidential candidates were beaten by government thugs after the election. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been pressuring for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster since February 1988 when he was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and engineered the ouster of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>.

 Leftist guerrillas attacked nine military posts early Wednesday and claimed to have killed or wounded six police in a raid on a coffee processing plant. The army confirmed the attacks on its outposts and said the only casualty was a civilian wounded at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mercedes </LOCATION>, 47 miles north of the capital in <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION> province. A broadcast on Venceremos, the clandestine rebel radio, said guerrillas damaged the plant, an electrical substation and a warehouse of the coffee-processing operation at <LOCATION> Chalchuapa </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, 48 miles northwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter who visited the scene found only the warehouse damaged.

 A Cabinet minister on Wednesday reproached three men who plan to pursue suits against the state for wrongful confinement and torture after being detained for more than a year without trial or charge.

<TEXT>
 Feuding Democrats and Republicans reached agreement Wednesday to clear the way for a committee vote on the controversial nomination of <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> to be ambassador to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, a key participant said. Sen. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky., said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., who has spurred an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> into <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s alleged links to the Iran-Contra affair, agreed to schedule a vote for June 20 if the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration produces all requested documents and information by June As a result, <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said, he is calling off a one-day Republican boycott of committee meetings, thus permitting the panel to act on this and other key nominations as well as a pending $ 2.5 billion <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> authorization bill. `` If the administration does n't produce the documents, obviously the deal would be off,'' <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said. But he said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials who were present at his meeting with <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> promised that the material would be produced by the deadline. <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said he obtained a written agreement that the vote on <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> will be held, even if <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> is not satisfied with the materials he recieves. `` If he isn'' t satisfied, then he can use that as an argument to vote against the nomination,'' <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said. `` But there still will be a vote.'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, meanwhile, will question <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> under oath for a second time at a hearing to be held on June 15. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and other senators are suspicious of <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s contacts with former national security council official <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and other Iran-Contra figures in 1985 when <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> served as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidemntial national security adviser. The questions central to the investigation are: _ Did <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> help <PERSON> North </PERSON> illegally resupply the Nicaraguan Contra rebels with military aid _ Is he lying about it now <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> maintains he had no role in supplying the Contras and that he is telling the truth about what he did and did not do. He has said he wants to use the hearings to clear the air and remove all suspicions about his conduct. <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said he led the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> boycott of the committee on Wednesday to prevent committee action on nominations and legislation because he feared <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> was being railroaded. `` This nomination has been up here since early March and I've told Sen. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> that I thought they were trying to kill the nomination with delays,'' <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said `` What I was unwilling to see continue was the effort to kill the nomination with delays and leaks.'' <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said he is optimistic that the <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> nomination can still be approved. `` But I think this has been made into a partisan matter so we'll have to wait and see,'' he said The end of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> boycott apparently will permit votes Thursday morning on the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> bill and nominations of <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> to be assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> to be assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and South Asian Affairs and former Sen.

Forty children were at the school, and one suffered bruises and cuts from flying glass. A tornado in <LOCATION> Clyde </LOCATION> in north central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> destroyed two barns and a trailer, but no injuries were reported. Winds up to 70 mph howled over the region, blowing over a mobile home, destroying roofs and storage buildings and downing trees and power lines. Baseball-size hail knocked out windows and damaged roofs near <LOCATION> Clifton </LOCATION> northwest of <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION>. Homes were flooded in the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> area. In <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, lightning struck an oil storage tank in <LOCATION> Yukon </LOCATION>, sparking a fire that destroyed a second tank and threatened a third tank saved by firefighters.

 Adult barn swallows and cliff swallows swooped and screeched Wednesday as two biologists carefully removed seven newborn birds and about 120 eggs from nests under two bridges scheduled for demolition. The birds and eggs found in about 60 nests had to be removed under provisions of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Migratory Bird Act before the bridges could be torn down, said state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Plathe </PERSON>. The two species are extremely abundant birds but are covered under the act, as are all migratory birds, said <PERSON> Carrol </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> of the state Department of Natural Resources. `` We're doing this to fulfill the federal requirements,'' said <PERSON> Plathe </PERSON>. `` We hope we do n't have to do this to every bridge in the future.'' As the nests were demolished, the adult birds flew around the area frantically. `` They do n't like their homes being torn down. But it's something we have to do to give the public a better ride,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Langston </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The $ 2.6 million road project includes two new, wider bridges and repaving of about seven miles of state Highway 22 about 60 miles west of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Hutchinson </LOCATION>. Construction engineers watched as the biologists, working as volunteers, removed eggs and bird babies before tearing the nests from the underside of the steel bridges over the <LOCATION> Crow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and scraping remaining mud and straw from the bridge. The babies and eggs were taken to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> for nursing and incubation However, the chance of survival for the newborns was slim, as was the chance the eggs would hatch after being disturbed, said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, a clinic biologist who helped in the removal. `` If we get 10 healthy hatches out of the eggs, I'd be surprised,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. The baby birds, each only about an inch long and not yet feathered, will require feeding by hand every 20 minutes from dawn to dusk by volunteers using tiny syringes, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. While efforts are being made to save their young, the adult swallows will be looking for a place to build new nests and should lay another set of eggs in two to three weeks, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. Swallows can build new nests in about three days, <PERSON> Plathe </PERSON> said, so contractors will have to knock any new nests from the bridges until they're torn down. One bridge was scheduled for demolition Thursday, the other in two weeks. `` In the future, we have to determine how to keep birds from nesting under bridges,'' <PERSON> Plathe </PERSON> said. `` We should have been out here this spring and hosed them off before they laid their eggs. But we did n't and they're here, so that's why we're doing this,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 Surgery eased abdominal pain and a persistent fever plaguing <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, but the ousted <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president remained in very critical condition Wednesday, a hospital spokesman said. `` It's not like this was the only source and now the infection is gone, but there was some response to the treatment and the pain and the fever appears to have decreased,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiwanak </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> administrator. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 71, underwent three hours of emergency, exploratory surgery Tuesday in which doctors drained a pancreatic abscess considered a source of a bacterial infection complicating treatment of his widespread organ failure. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> suffered cardiac, kidney and pulmonary failure May 18, and since has been in very critical and unstable condition. The pancreas helps break down food and produces hormones necessary to regulate the body's metabolism. The exiled leader remained on life-support equipment Wednesday, including a respirator to regulate his breathing, <PERSON> Tiwanak </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> also undergoes hemodialysis four times a week to cleanse his body of wastes. His medical team has been instructed to take any measure to keep <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> alive. Aides said the ousted leader's mind remains clear and that he makes his own decisions. `` Just because he ca n't talk, he ca n't breathe, does n't mean he ca n't think,'' said adviser <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aruiza </PERSON>, adding that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> agreed to the surgery. <PERSON> Tiwanak </PERSON> said no further surgery was planned and doctors had not determined whether the abscess was a major source of the infection. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has lived in exile in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> since a popular revolt catapulted <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to the Philippine presidency three years ago. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, widow of assassinated <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> foe <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, has repeatedly denied the pleas of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, to return home. Both Marcoses are under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment for allegedly stealing more than $ 100 million from the Philippine treasury and stashing it in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. However, a federal judge severed <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> from the case, meaning he will not be prosecuted unless he recovers, and no trial date has been set for Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who pleaded innocent to the charges and is free on $ 5 million bail. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been hospitalized since Jan. 15 and doctors said it was a `` miracle'' he has survived so long.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation on Wednesday speeding $ 3.3 billion to veterans programs and a host of money-short federal agencies, setting up potentially difficult talks with a House that passed a different version of the bill. Senators approved the bill on a voice vote on the fourth day of debate. Final passage came after lawmakers refused to delay for one year much of the new <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> catastrophic health care program for the elderly. The bill now goes to a conference committee with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which passed its version last month, to iron out differences before the bill goes to the president. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., had led a fight to postpone parts of the program, including a surtax on senior citizens that has drawn complaints because of its cost His effort was defeated 51-49 on a procedural vote in which he was opposed by leaders of both parties. Lawmakers, however, did adopt by voice a non-binding provision offered by the leaders calling on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to consider making changes in the catastrophic care program in future legislation. There is widespread agreement that the surtax will likely collect more money than expected, but disputes remain over whittling down the levy. `` Certainly most Americans would rather not have to pay anything and receive the benefits,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. `` That's the American way But we're broke.'' Earlier, across the Capitol, four <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members of both parties joined members of veterans associations at a news conference to accuse the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> of delaying the legislation while senators attach pet projects to it. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the veterans money, $ 1.2 billion, on May 24. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was holding the veterans funds `` hostage to the pet projects of senators who have included the veterans money in a Christmas tree of non-emergency appropriations.'' Chairman G.V. <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss., of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> complained that because of the delay, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> was already `` gearing down'' some of its operations `` We've never hollered wolf about this situation at all,'' he said. The spending bill, which President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> first proposed as a $ 2.2 billion measure in March, contains money for health care, compensation increases, and other programs for veterans. For want of the money, the veterans agency has begun limiting out-patient care in less-serious cases, delayed opening new facilities and halted many maintenance proects and equipment purchases. The department annually treats around 3.5 million of the nation's 27 million veterans. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>'s amendment, offered Tuesday, would delay for a year the surtax people over age 65 must pay to help finance the catastrophic care program. It would also postpone other important parts of the program, including caps it places on senior citizens' doctors' bills and a prescription drug benefit. Democrats had countered with an alternative calling for changes to be considered in future legislation. The overall measure also contains $ 892 million for student loans, $ 100 million to help refugees move to this country, and finances for fighting forest fires, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping, unemployment benefits, foster care, and other programs. The legislation has picked up a batch of amendments in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, including several of interest to particular lawmakers. One addition would protect a school district in <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, from sacrificing about $ 700,000 in federal aid this year it would otherwise have to yield because of a loss of students covered by an assistance program. The clause was sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, an Appropriations Committee member. The bill also contains $ 75 million to repair a radio telescope in the home state of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; orders the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to spend $ 50 million to buy cold-weather clothing made in 10 states; and sets aside $ 400,000 to study last year's fires in Yellowstone National The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also added its own favorite provisions to the bill. These include: language easing the way for <PERSON> Alton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, to lease land on which it could build a public marina; allowing a $ 2.5 million increase in spending for cotton and tobacco grading; and providing up to $ 360,000 for aviation research at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. The House bill also contains $ 822 million not in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure for anti-drug programs.

 Two congressmen vying to succeed Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> started hitting the campaign trail and each other Wednesday, only hours after their primary victories. Democrat <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, a winner by 27,000 votes, was at commuter train station by 7:30 a.m. and talking to more than 1,000 senior citizens by lunch time. Nearly eight years ago he lost to <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> by the narrowest margin in state history _ 1,797 votes out of 2.3 million cast. Republican <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> used the day to appear with <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, who's still very popular among voters and is considered an important political ally, even though he differs with <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> on key issues <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, barred by law from seeking a third consecutive term, endorsed no primary candidate but filmed commercials for the frontrunners that aired in a media blitz during the final weeks of the primary. Also decided in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> on Tuesday was a bitter primary for the Democratic mayoral nomination in <LOCATION> Plainfield </LOCATION>, where City Councilman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> upset Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> by a 198-vote margin, 2,172 to 1,974. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, elected mayor in 1985, and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a 7-year councilman, head two factions of the city's Democratic party for years. Their primary fight this year was the most public show of animosity between the two popular politicians. At one point, both submitted to urine tests to fend off allegations that they consorted with drug dealers. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, a conservative who comes from a wealthy family and the Republican-rich northwestern part of the state, is expert on foreign affairs and gained national attention as a member of the Iran-Contra committee. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, the son of a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> shipyard worker, has a formidable political base in southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and a national reputation as an environmentalist. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> has amassed a `` big spending'' voting record in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and established himself as the head of machine politics in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> also backed away from his `` no new taxes'' primary campaign platform, and said if he ever had to raise taxes it would be `` only as a last resort'' but he would `` bend over backwards'' to avoid a tax increase. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> picked up a favorite theme of <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primary opponents and condemned <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>'s free-market plan to lower insurance rates by deregulating the industry. While saying political labels serve no purpose, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> termed <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>'s call for deregulation so politically conservative it was `` off the charts of reasonability.'' Both candidates promised to spell out where they differ from one another, and said voters will have some clear choices.

<HEAD>Senate Rejects Move to Delay Catastrophic Act Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> narrowly rejected a proposal Wednesday to delay the start of major provisions of <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>'s new catastrophic health care coverage, a proposal opponents argued would have effectively killed the new benefits. Reacting to criticism from senior citizens opposed to paying an income tax surcharge to help pay for the program, backers of the delay proposal argued that it was unfair to put roughly two-thirds of the cost of the program on roughly one-third of retired Americans with enough income to make them subject to income taxes. Those who voted against delaying the coverage maintained that huge federal budget deficits make it impossible to provide new benefits without providing a way to pay for them and that middle-and upper-income retired Americans should foot a major share of the cost. The surtax could be as much as $ 800 a year for Medicare-eligible retirees in upper income ranges. In the key vote, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 51-49 against an attempt by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., to kill an amendment by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> that called on the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to review the program while benefits continue on schedule <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> introduced his amendment as a substitute to <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>'s proposal to delay provisions while a way to reduce the surtax is found. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> then quickly adopted by voice votes the <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> substitute amendment and attached it to a pending supplemental appropriations measure to pump $ 3.3 billion additional money into a variety of federal programs for the current fiscal year. `` Nowhere in my amendment will you find the word repeal, but you will find the word delay,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> maintained. He termed the <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> amendment a `` smokescreen'' that would not require <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> action and vowed to continue his fight to in order delay in implementation of the surtax. Sen. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn., argued that approving <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>'s delay of some benefits would amount to repeal because it would send a clear signal to the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to let the program `` We're going to get wisdom real quick and there is no way you're going to get this back out of that committee,'' said <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, a member of the panel that crafted the catastrophic health act The measure cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last summer on an 86-11 vote and, with similarly overwhelming <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approval, was signed into law with great fanfare by President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> who had proposed a more modest and less expensive version. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> was one of the 11 senators opposing the catastrophic health measure last year. Opponents of the <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> attempt argued that an estimated 59 percent of the 32 million Medicare beneficaries do not have enough income to qualify for income tax and would pay only $ 4 a month for the additional coverage. They cited <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 70 percent of those eligible for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> would pay $ 100 or less a year in additional surtaxes and that only 5.6 percent in upper income levels would pay the maximum $ 800 tax. The catastrophic coverage took effect Jan. 1 with unlimited hospitalization coverage after a once-a-year $ 560 deductible. However, a $ 1,370 cap on out-of-pocket doctor bills does not kick in until next year and a new prescription drug benefit begins a three-year phase-in period in 1991. It was those benefits beginning next January that <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> wanted to delay, along with the surtax _ or `` supplemental premium'' _ to finance them. The surtax started this year to build up a trust fund to pay the new benefits without dipping into the federal treasury.

 Bags of money fell out of an armored car on a busy highway during rush hour Wednesday and traffic backed up almost a half-mile when motorists stopped and scrambled for the cash, police said. `` This is an education in greed in people,'' police Officer <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> said. `` People were just stopping their cars and getting out and grabbing money.'' Police caught at least two people who allegedly took money from the <ORGANIZATION> Loomis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> truck, and have license number of others. <PERSON> Loomis </PERSON> officials did not take phone calls Wednesday, and it was not known how much money was in the truck and how much was lost. The money spilled out of the back of a <LOCATION> Loomis </LOCATION> truck on Interstate 10 just east of downtown, said <PERSON> Campos </PERSON>, who was first on the scene. Police said some drivers tossed bags of money into their cars, while others scooped up loose bills that littered the four-lane highway. `` With the turbulence of the traffic, the money was flying in the air like a <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> commercial,'' police shift supervisor <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> DiMatteo </PERSON> said, who added that at least 20 motorists stopped to grab some cash. <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> and his partner, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Porterfield </PERSON>, were working undercover in an unmarked car when they happened upon the accident and saw two men get out of a pickup and stuff wads of money in their pockets and pants. The two men hopped back in their pickup and drove off, but the two plainclothes officers were in pursuit. When the men were pulled over, police found $ 3,840 on them. The pair had not been formally charged as of Wednesday afternoon. `` They did n't know they were being followed,'' <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> said. `` It kind of ruined their day _ from the happiest to ` I'm going to jail.''' Other people were thought to have gotten away with money bags, <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> said, adding that police had license numbers of some. He said anyone caught taking money would be charged with felony theft if they did not return the cash. The half-mile traffic jam dispersed quickly after police arrived, he said. For the next hour or so, police and fire officials collected $ 8,800 in stray currency _ mostly $ 20 bills _ from the roadside. They found a bag containing $ 800 in $ 20 bills in a storm drain. In October 1987, about 200 people converged on Interstate 71 near downtown <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, after the rear door of a <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> truck swung open. Bags of cash fell onto the highway and at least one ripped open. The <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> quoted sources as saying more than $ 1 million was lost. But one man turned in nearly $ 57,000, saying he considered keeping the money but could not in good conscience. Metropolitan gave him a reward of 10 percent of the amount returned.

This week <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> zeroed in on the controversy over the recently published diary of the late artist <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>, but he had planned to take his characters back to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> next week. `` Then everything intensified over the weekend, so we killed that week,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON>, editorial director of the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicate </ORGANIZATION>, which distributes the strip. `` The whole situation blew up.'' <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> said another week of strips on the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> theme, for use starting June 12, had been sent to newspapers last Friday when the weekend's events in which hundreds were killed made the cartoons inappropriate. <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> said the substitute strips sent out Sunday provide `` kind of an obtuse look at the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill.'' <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> that the premise of the substitute strips `` is that the artist tips an ink bottle on a whole week's worth of strips. He told the newspaper that the second week of strips on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was `` predicated on a peaceful resolution.'' `` That was a very bad miscalculation ... and now obviously inappropriate,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> became the first Soviet bloc nation to denounce the crackdown in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> said Wednesday it will end a 40-year ban on mail and telephone links with the mainland to help spread reports of the bloodbath. <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said the military attack on pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last weekend had shocked his nation. Events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have had special repercussions in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, where many remember the Soviet military's violent suppression of the 1956 revolt. Hundreds, and possibly thousands, died when <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> troops moved into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to crush the student movement. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said in a statement issued by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>: `` The tragedy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has shocked <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members and Hungarian society as a whole. `` I firmly declare that we deeply condemn violence and fratricidal war. These methods have nothing to do with socialism.'' Later, several thousand young people, including <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students, staged a peaceful demonstration outside the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and gave a petition the embassy's first secretary promised to pass to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s opposition said more than 2,000 people in the southern city of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> demonstrated Wednesday against the Chinese crackdown and demanded a clear condemnation from the communist authorities. On Tuesday, official spokesman <PERSON> Zbyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rykowksi </PERSON> said the government felt `` deep concern.'' In <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, Communications Minister <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chien-pang </PERSON> said telephone service to 80 cities on the mainland will begin Saturday through a switching center in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, and mail service will start in a week. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> said this will not change <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s policy of refusing to have any official contacts with the mainland government because the telecommunication and postal administrations of the rival governments will not be directly linked. The Nationalists in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> were defeated in a civil war in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1949, but continue to claim they are the legitimate government of all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Nationalists and Communists are technically still at war. Also on Wednesday, the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> government-run <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> began a 24-hour news broadcast to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on shortwave channels. The station also established a hot line to receive telephone calls from <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> listeners. In <LOCATION> Miaoli </LOCATION>, 75 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, about 10,000 people held a rally and condemned the mainland government for the killings in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. In an interview by the mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> suggested the ideology governing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other socialist nations is dying. `` The call for freedom can not be smashed forever under the weight of tanks,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. `` Those in power must sooner or later recognize that economic progress can not be achieved without human rights.'' <PERSON> Dieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said `` economic assistance will definitely be affected if it is determined that the reforms are dead.'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said West German companies in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> may also take a hard look at future investment policies. A West German relief agency suspended new projects in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to protest the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government's decision to use force to quell the popular protests. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> had announced it halted aid projects and postponed official visits, but said Wednesday this resulted from the chaos in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and did not reflect a `` policy decision.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the largest contributor of aid to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Assistance, most in the form of loans, totaled $ 6.1 billion as of 1987, the latest figures available. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s reluctance to criticize <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> mainly stems from its unwillingness to antagonize its neighbors, who still harbor resentment against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for its actions during World War II. Soldiers in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> fired in a diplomatic compound on Wednesday and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ordered the evacuation of all diplomatic dependents and non-essential personnel. It also urged all other Americans in the country to leave immediately. `` There's been no communication from the leadership. There's no indication who the leadership is,'' said White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have mounted a wide-ranging effort _ using spy satellites, embassy intelligence and interviews with Americans leaving <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ in an attempt to determine what is going on in the strife-torn nation. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, about 1,000 Chinese students chanting `` democracy'' burned effigies of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> communist leaders. Many carried Taiwanese flags and placards that read `` Sword shall perish by sword.'' About 350 Chinese and Filipinos marched to a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> consular office in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, where they laid wreaths and called for the downfall of Chinese Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, about 1,000 students marched in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said it was sending 1,000 postcards to Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> calling for the withdrawal of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s ambassador from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and trade sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, crowds of Chinese residents protested in trucks, taxis and marches, shouting for the resignation of Chinese leaders. Officials said the crowd could have been larger if organized rallies had not been canceled after a riot during the night, when a mob tried to storm branches of mainland Chinese banks. Organizers feared their rallies might trigger further violence, and urged demonstrators to remain at home or pray at churches for the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> victims. Police said they had no estimate on the number of protesters, but noted they were usually six abreast and stretched down several streets.

 A man set free his four imported, 3-inch-long, hissing cockroaches in this semi-tropical city because he was afraid the state might jail him and destroy his beloved bugs, a pet store owner said Wednesday. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> last week ordered the Critter Shop to stop selling the <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> hissing roaches, fearing if they got free, they might breed and spread across the South like the flying <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> cockroach. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Denmark </PERSON>, chief of entomology in the department's Division of <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, said he's concerned about the effect on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s lucrative tourist industry if the hissing insects multiply. The man, who bought the four insects in January, said he freed the roaches in his back yard, said <ORGANIZATION> Critter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> manager <PERSON> Chloe </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>. `` He came in and said, ` Man, I was scared. I let them loose. I was afraid they'd put me in jail,''' Ms. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. `` He said he did n't want the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> to hurt them.'' She would not identify the man, and said she would n't tell the agriculture department the man's name, either. `` Not me,'' Ms. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. `` I've got to live in this end of town.'' Agricultural agents have said they do n't know much about the roaches, which are bred by some zoos and distributed by wholesalers as food for certain reptiles. The Critter Shop got a shipment of 12 of the insects in January and sold six of the roaches in the first four months, and the rest in just two days after reports the bugs were trendy, cheap to feed and easy to maintain. `` Now that they say these are a bad thing, everybody wants to buy them,'' Ms. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. `` Somebody came in today wanting some.'' Most researchers believe the roaches do not reproduce easily. But <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s warm, wet climate might be attractive to the species, which is at home in tropical and subtropical environments, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> said. Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Smalley </PERSON>, a longtime customer of the shop, has offered to help fight the stop-sale order, which the state said applied only to the Critter Shop because it's the only store known to be selling the roaches. <PERSON> Smalley </PERSON> said he's checking the order's legality, and so far has found that `` no one ... knows what to about it.'' He believes the plant industries division may be out of its jurisdiction, saying the order cites a plant industry rule and refers to nursery stock. `` But this roach is not a plant,'' <PERSON> Smalley </PERSON> said.

 Rebel ambushes killed at least 100 people in northern <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> in the past week, a government official said Wednesday. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Alai </PERSON>, deputy minister of commerce, said the ambushes were staged in <LOCATION> Gulu </LOCATION> Province by Holy Spirit Movement guerrillas. `` Some people were killed in attacks on convoys, while others _ especially displaced people who normally frequent the rural areas from the towns hunting for food _ also fell victim,'' <PERSON> Alai </PERSON> said in an interview. The Holy Spirit Movement was thought to have been crushed in 1987 when its former leader, warrior-priestess <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Lakena </PERSON>, fled to neighboring <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, where she has been detained. Remnants of her movement regrouped in northern <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> last year, however, and have evaded army sweeps aimed at stamping them out.

 A jury Wednesday sentenced a 36-year-old man to death for the torture slayings of six young women whose nude bodies were found dumped on a remote hillside. <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, 36, shook his head repeatedly as <ORGANIZATION> Clackamas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jurors were polled after 17 hours of deliberations over two days. `` They did n't follow the rules,'' he said. Judge <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> then formally sentenced <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> to die by injection. The small-engine repairman, convicted of aggravated murder May 4, is already serving a life sentence for stabbing a prostitute to death in a suburban parking lot in 1987. `` We're happy justice was done,'' said prosecutor <PERSON> Andrejs </PERSON> <PERSON> Eglitis </PERSON>. Defense attorney <PERSON> Christoper </PERSON> <PERSON> Burris </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' case, like all death penalty cases, are appealed automatically to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The six victims were known or suspected prostitutes ranging in age from 16 to 35 whose bodies were found on a rural hillside near <LOCATION> Molalla </LOCATION> about 30 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. All were stabbed repeatedly in the back. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was not charged in the death of a seventh victim, who has not been identified. The feet were sawed from three of the bodies, and one victim was sliced open from her pubic bone to her sternum. During the trial, several prostitutes testified that <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> took them to the <LOCATION> Mollala </LOCATION> area, bound their wrists and angles, and cut or bit their feet and breasts. Aggravated murder is punishable by death or life in prison in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. To sentence <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> to death, jurors had to unanimously find the crimes were deliberate and that the defendant was likely to commit violence again. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' criminal history stretches back to 1972, when he stabbed a 15-year-old girl with a hunting knife. The girl told police <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> proposed marriage to her immediately after the attack. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> served 27 months in prison between June 1979 and January 1982. He also spent nine months in the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in 1974.

 A demonstration by car drivers protesting the military crackdown in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> turned violent early Wednesday as mobs smashed shop windows and attempted to attack banks linked to Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Up to 4,000 people rioted in the <LOCATION> Mongkok </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Yaumatei </PERSON> districts of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s sister city of <LOCATION> Kowloon </LOCATION>, according to police. They said rioters hurled stones and bottles at police who responded with tear gas. Seventeen people, including five policemen, were injured, according to a police statement. It reported a procession of cars was traveling through the zone with horns honking to protest the killings in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> when an object thrown from a building struck one of the vehicles. A crowd quickly gathered and some people began rampaging through the streets, setting fires in garbage cans, smashing windows and trying to break into shops, witnesses said. The violence began shortly after midnight and when order was restored before dawn the main <LOCATION> Nathan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> throughfare was littered with glass and charred rubbish. Government-owned Radio <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> said some people in the crowd wore black arm bands and shouted `` Down with <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>!'' the Chinese premier. But <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Police Commissioner <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Anning </PERSON> said the rioters were not part of the main stream of people who have been demonstrating daily in this British colony in support of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> students demanding more democracy. He appealed to people who want to demonstrate their support for the students to `` disassociate themselves from criminal and unruly elements.'' A local group supporting the pro-democracy movement in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> announced after the violence that it was canceling all rallies and a procession planned for Wednesday that it had scheduled as part of a general strike. The <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alliance </LOCATION> was formed after up to 1 million people joined in a march on May 21 to demonstrate support for the residents of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.

 A Surinamese jetliner trying to land in dense fog clipped treetops and broke apart near the airport on Wednesday, killing 169 of those aboard, the government-run news agency said. It listed 13 survivors. At least three Americans, the cockpit crew, were reported dead in <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>'s worst air disaster. President <PERSON> Ramsewak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shankar </PERSON> declared a week of mourning. The plane crashed after it hit a treetop on its third attempt to land in `` extremely bad'' weather, said airline spokesman <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marapin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. Three of <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>'s senior military leaders were aboard and presumed dead. Also reported aboard were at least three top Dutch soccer players of Surinamese origin. Their fates were unknown. The <ORGANIZATION> Surinam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> DC-8 was completing an all-night flight from <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> to the capital of this small nation on the northern shoulder of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Airline spokesman <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jie </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> said most passengers were Surinamese living in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. Survivors, including three children, were taken to a hospital, the <ORGANIZATION> Suriname </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. No immediate information was available on their conditions. The agency said one boy was hurled out of the plane and was rescued when he came running out of the jungle crying for his mother. Airline spokesman <PERSON> Robbi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lachmising </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> the Surinamese airport has no radar. He said the plane carried 173 passengers and nine crew and said 168 were killed and 14 survived. The news agency listed only 13 survivors, however. Listed as missing and presumed dead were <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>'s army chief of staff, Maj. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieuw </PERSON> <PERSON> Yen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tai </PERSON>; air force commander Maj. <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Djoe </PERSON>, and army chief of operations Capt. <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Salomons </PERSON>. The airline identified the cockpit crew as Americans Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, pilot <PERSON> Glyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON> and engineer <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, all employees of <ORGANIZATION> Surinam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. Further information about them was not immediately known. The agency quoted airline director <PERSON> Motilal </PERSON> <PERSON> Atta </PERSON> <PERSON> Mungra </PERSON> as saying in <LOCATION> Paramaribo </LOCATION> that all cabin crew members were Surinamers and all were killed. Flight PY764 took off late Tuesday from <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Schiphol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and crashed at 4:30 a.m. about two miles from <LOCATION> Zanderij </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, about 15 miles south of the capital, the agency said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, board spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said that at the request of <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>'s government, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> sent a team of five investigators to assist in the crash investigation. <PERSON> Mungra </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team would assist a government investigation commission headed by Attorney General <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeder </PERSON>. Reporters at the crash site, an unpopulated tropical savannah, said it appeared the plane struck two trees and split into four parts. Heavy rain had turned the area into a near-swamp, slowing rescue vehicles. The <ORGANIZATION> Suriname </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the plane's cockpit recorder was recovered. Wreckage and bodies were scattered over a wide area. Hours after the crash, firefighters still sprayed foam on the smoldering and broken fuselage. Soldiers searched for bodies, belongings and documents. The 20-year-old plane was registered in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lachmising </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION> radio reports quoted residents as saying they heard an explosion shortly before the plane hit the ground. <PERSON> Lachmising </PERSON> said the plane did not explode or catch fire after breaking up. He said the jetliner, leased by <ORGANIZATION> Surinam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> from an unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company, was extensively overhauled in <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> about 10 days ago. Spokesman <PERSON> Nico </PERSON> <PERSON> Snijders </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION>, a Dutch organization for professional soccer players, identified three Dutch soccer players of Surinamese origin who he said were aboard _ Orwin Linger, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Doesburg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>. They were bound for a national tournament in <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>, a former Dutch colony. At <ORGANIZATION> Surinam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>' downtown office in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, dozens of weeping relatives gathered to await news. <PERSON> Mungra </PERSON> was quoted as saying his company all but ruled out a technical malfunction because the DC-8 underwent a regular 3,000-mile maintenance checkup two weeks ago. He suspended all flights of the line's remaining aircraft. <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>, a nation of about 300,000, gained independence from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> in 1975. About 200,000 Surinamese live in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>.

 The former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the central figure in the bribery scandal that has rocked Japanese politics, was released Tuesday on bail of $ 1.4 million, officials said. <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, 52, spent 113 days in custody after his arrest in February on charges of bribing former <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executives <PERSON> Ei </PERSON> <PERSON> Shikiba </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hisahiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> was the last person to be released from among the 12 people indicted and arrested in the scandal. Bail for the others ranged from the equivalent of $ 35,200 to $ 209,800, said <PERSON> Akira </PERSON> <PERSON> Saito </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> also was charged later with offering cut-rate stock shares to <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON>, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, ex-Vice Education Minister <PERSON> Kunio </PERSON> <PERSON> Takaishi </PERSON>, former Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Takao </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Kasuya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ikeda </PERSON> and ex-Vice Labor Minister <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>. Recipients of the stock shares were charged with receiving bribes and have been freed on bail. <PERSON> Ryutaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON>, the new secretary general of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference Tuesday his political support group had received but did not report about $ 1.1 million in donations in April 1985, including $ 2,820 from <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information and publishing conglomerate. <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON> said Friday he had received $ 14,000 in donations in 1986 from Recruit. He said Tuesday he had not intended to conceal the 1985 donations and apologized for not having properly supervised his secretaries who he said had handled the transactions. <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON> was appointed to the party post as part of the administration of new Prime Minister Sousuke Uno. Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> resigned Friday in an attempt to clear the stains of the bribery scandal from the Liberal Democrats. The scandal surfaced last summer when the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> reported that the deputy mayor of a city near <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> had received bargain-priced stocks from Recruit in exchange for favors to the company. In the following months investigations showed that Recruit provided cut-rate stock to about 160 politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen and gave large donations to some politicians and their organizations in an alleged attempt to buy influence.

The first act is a blithe, bitchy look at one fan's extreme fascination with opera; the second, a melodramatic and deadly examination of a gay love affair gone wrong. The two do n't tie together neatly, but they make for some compelling, often entertaining and even unnerving theater. <PERSON> McNally </PERSON>, author of `` <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> in the <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lune </PERSON>,'' excels at the knowing put-down, the slightly sour but funny observation. In the past, he has skewered <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> theater people in `` It's Only a Play.'' In `` The <ORGANIZATION> Lisbon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traviata </ORGANIZATION>,'' he dissects opera buffs, specifically the homosexual fans who idolized certain female stars. These are the men who call singers only by their first names, who have encyclopedic knowledge of opera trivia and who buy every recording made by their heroines. <PERSON> Mendy </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> -RRB- is one such true believer, a worshipper of <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Callas </PERSON>. He learns his good friend <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Heald </PERSON> -RRB- has purchased a pirated recording of <PERSON> Callas </PERSON>' 1958 performance of `` La Traviata'' in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. Much of Act 1 deals with <PERSON> Mendy </PERSON>'s attempts to obtain a copy of the record. In between the pleading and cajoling, the two men dish and then demolish just about every diva around from <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> to <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sills </PERSON> to <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>. Their comments are mean, unfair and funny. Yet there is a sadness, almost a desperation, underlying the revelry. `` Opera does n't reject me,'' <PERSON> Mendy </PERSON> sighs. `` The real world does.'' Wearing a too-tight bathrobe, Lane flounces around an overdone <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment, designed by <PERSON> Philipp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> to look like the outside of a box of Valentine candy. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>'s is a joke-filled role guaranteed to win audience sympathy, but the actor never succumbs to buffonery or soap opera histrionics. He finds both the humor and the humiliation in the character. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> is more enigmatic and not very likable, a trait that does n't really become apparent until the second act. By then, the locale has switched to <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>'s apartment, a stark, sparse living space filled with expensive stereo equipment and scores of neatly shelved records and CDs. And the comedy has disappeared in favor of melodrama involving <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>, his lover <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s new boyfriend. The plot takes on aspects of grand opera as <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> forces the play to a tragic conclusion. The playwright has improved the play since its last incarnation at a small off-off-Broadway theater four years ago. <PERSON> McNally </PERSON> has enriched the second act, giving <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> a strong speech explaining why he is leaving <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Heald </PERSON> turns in a riveting performance as <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>, whose fondness for opera colors his real-life relationships. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> is fine as the disgruntled lover. He forcefully articulates what is wrong when someone only focuses on what he likes. From the comedy in Act 1 to the tragedy in Act 2, director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillinger </PERSON> keeps a firm hand on the proceedings. The two acts may not mesh, but they both point out that there are consequences when life tries to imitate art.

 Construction unions and businesses have agreed to a plan that would keep heavy trucks from making deliveries during peak commuting hours to help reduce air pollution, Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> announced Tuesday. <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s skies are among the nation's most polluted because of surrounding mountains that trap the filth along with stagnant weather and industries that operate in the area. The city agreed to exempt from its proposed traffic management program trucks and equipment necessary for pouring concrete, laying hot asphalt and erecting structural steel, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. In return, the construction industry `` agreed to shift its work hours _ without premium pay _ to 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. instead of the current 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. to reduce truck and automobile traffic,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. The one-hour shift would remove about 125,000 construction workers from city streets during morning and afternoon rush-hour traffic, the mayor said. The proposal, developed by the city jointly with a regional air quality control agency, would require truck operators to pay a surcharge for a license allowing them to use city streets during rush hour. It also would create a rapid deployment task force intended to quickly respond and clean up major accidents. The altered work schedule would involve members of 83 union locals, including boiler makers, brick layers, carpenters, operating engineers, teamsters, general contractors, pipe trade workers and painters. The plan is expected to go before the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> early next month.

A committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> said in the study that though millions of childhood mental disorders are not treated, the situation has improved in the last 20 years and there is `` demonstrable progress'' toward understanding, preventing and correcting many of the mental diseases of youngsters. `` There is increasing reason for optimism that many of the major childhood mental disorders are responsive to treatment,'' the committee said. But in far too many cases, no treatment at all is being offered to troubled youngsters, the committee said.

 With President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowing that the `` scourge'' of drugs will stop and drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> organizing the troops for a full-scale war, calls for decriminalization of drug use are like cries in the dark.

Today, huge drug profits and artificially high drug prices are fueling the violent crime plaguing cities throughout the country, they say. Removing the profits would remove the criminals, the argument goes, and the billions of dollars now spent on unsuccessful enforcement efforts could be funneled into treatment and education programs.

<TEXT>
 Why use a cudgel when a scalpel is called for? In one form or another that question forever arises in discussions of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> or monetary policy, which involves decisions about the supply and cost of money in the economy. Most likely it will continue to arise for years to come, the simple truth being that monetary officials are familiar with the cudgel, a blunt instrument, but have n't yet acquired skill with the more refined scalpel. As a consequence, critics say, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s inevitable first reaction to signs of inflation is to slow the economy, mainly by restricting the money supply and thereby raising interest rates. It works. Just as a human being would falter under repeated blows to the head, the economy eventually slows. Factories close, unemployment rises and demand lessens. No mystery there; people just do n't have the money to buy. But the question remains: Why should the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> have to slow the whole economy rather than simply restraining the inflationary culprits? Because the instruments and skills do n't seem to be available to it. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, an international investment adviser and frequent critic of <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy, claims that for years monetary policy failed to perceive the true causes of domestic inflation and needlessly bludgeoned the American economy. He becomes particularly incensed at repeated <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> efforts to dampen the American economy because of a factor that should have been dealt with abroad. The inflationary factor was Eurodollars, created by European banks. In his view, these dollars, created whenever dollar-denominated loans were made by foreign banks, created a classic inflation scenario, that of too many dollars chasing too few goods. Prices rose, but not because of domestic demand but because foreign banks created dollars without any supervision or restraints by American authorities. Still, he says, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> response to Eurodollar inflation was to cudgel the American economy into repeated recessions. A somewhat similar worry arises today. Inflation for the 12 months ended in April was 5.1 percent, up from 3.9 percent in the year before, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. The suggestion is that of general inflation. However, over the same time the consumer price index inflation rate for all items, less food and energy, barely rose. For the 12 months ended in April 1988 it was 4.3 percent. For the 12 months through April 1989 it was 4.6 percent. Exclude food and energy prices and the inflation rate is almost stable. Add them and you have a dangerous trend. Now, however, there are some indications that food and energy prices may have stabilized, albeit at high levels. Last year's drought largely was responsible for driving up food prices by 6.5 percent. While there is no assurance the drought will not continue or resume, those knowledgeable about weather conditions are optimistic. Last year energy prices rose 8.7 percent, largely on the basis of reduced production by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> Exporting Countries. This year there are some indications supplies will be larger than before. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> watchers therefore are expressing optimism that <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy wo n't grow harsher, and even that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will ease up on the economy, allowing interest rates to fall. In short, the belief is that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will try to use the scalpel instead of the familiar cudgel.

 Often derided as `` a nice place to live, but you would n't want to visit,'' <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> tries one more time next month to amuse conventioneers and capture its soul as Underground <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> opens for business _ again. Seven years after the lights went out, ostensibly for good, the entertainment and shopping playground beneath downtown is set to open Thursday after a three-year overhaul under the auspices of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the wizards of American urban reclamation. In its prime, Underground <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s answer to the French Quarter, created in old storefronts that were the city's heart before a network of bridges over railroad tracks literally raised downtown one level Underground had swinging Dixieland, loud rock' n' roll, cool jazz, fine eateries, chic watering holes _ even a shop where segregationist restaurateur-turned-governor <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> signed autographs and sold souvenirs. Underground opened in 1969, peaked in 1972, was struggling by 1975, and was gone by 1982. It was eulogized as the victim of crime _ or a perception thereof _ derelicts, subway construction, ripoff merchants and changing times. There were dozens of theories about what went wrong, but seemingly no answers. Without it, downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> has acquired the reputation of a ghost town after dark, which has been an albatross around the neck of the city's thriving convention industry. While conventioneers sit in gleaming downtown hotels, real Atlantans are miles away in the biracial city's largely white suburbs. In 1985, the city signed the deal for a $ 142 million rerevitalization. It turned to <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON>, the people responsible for <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Faneuil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Place </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>'s Harborplace, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seaport </LOCATION>, among other projects. `` We're trying to create a town center for metropolitan <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, back to the birthplace of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the Underground <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> development company. `` We want it to be a place ... where visitors will come to find out about what <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> has to offer, but where also the hometown crowd can feel some sense of identity.'' Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> sees the new Underground as `` one of the most significant accomplishments'' of two terms in office. `` This represents a new heart for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. It represents a gathering place for the entire metro area.'' The new Underground is on and around the original site, on downtown's south side, just blocks from the high-rise hotel district. It's three times the size of the old Underground; visitors will find 22 restaurants and nightclubs and nearly 100 retailers. While the emphasis on retailing marks a change for Underground, the entertainment focus is something new for <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON>. `` We've never done this strong an entertainment aspect to any of our urban places,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, vice president and general manager of <LOCATION> Rouse-Atlanta </LOCATION>, the Rouse affiliate created to run the project. `` Some of that is due to the name,'' he said. `` Underground <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> has probably the highest name recognition of any project we've ever touched ... and what Underground <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was known for was entertainment.'' Rouse officials anticipate 10 million to 11 million visitors a year, half of them out-of-towners. They say there are enough office workers and convention-goers downtown to meet three-fourths of Underground's needs. Even so, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said, `` The real test of whether the project succeeds ... is whether the project appeals to residents. The obvious concern _ what a lot of people talk about around here _ is security.'' That's because the old Underground came to be regarded as dangerous. <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephensen </PERSON>, whose <PERSON> Dante </PERSON>'s Down The Hatch jazz club and restaurant anchored the old Underground, said, `` At its worst, Underground had a lower crime rate than Lenox Square -LRB- a popular mall -RRB-. But downtown areas ca n't protect themselves from bad publicity.'' Clearly, this time around Underground must be perceived as safe. `` We've taken a common-sense approach,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. A squad of some 30 private guards will patrol, accompanied by <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> police, who are building a 34-officer substation there. Planners have made sure there are no blind alleys, and lighting designers have made it bright enough to read at midnight. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> admits to being irked that he is repeatedly asked what Underground will do to keep out `` undesirables.'' `` First, tell me who the ` undesirables' are. This is a town center. It's open to everyone. If a person comes to Underground and happens to look different, that's fine. If a person starts to infringe on somebody else's rights, that's not fine.'' A no-nonsense security policy seems to have wide public appeal. Where city officials triggered a storm of criticism with a plan to run vagrants out before last year's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, hardly anything has been heard from anyone concerned about loiterers' civil rights in Underground. `` I do n't see it as a problem,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. `` The biggest problem is in perception, and that perception problem goes away as people come here and have a good time and find out they are n't hassled. `` I would be surprised,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said, `` if Underground is not the safest place in the whole <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area.'' It had better be. The city has sunk more than $ 80 million in revenue bonds, as well as other public funding, into Underground. If it flops, the city could be forced to cough up some $ 3 million a year for 30 years. `` Underground is important symbolically, and it is a test of whether a town center can work here, whether we have enough cohesiveness,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` Because if we continue to drift apart, as we've been doing, there could be all sorts of consequences _ economic, political, social and otherwise.'' And although <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON> has relatively little capital invested, the company's track record is on the line. `` It seems that each year, the expectations get higher, as they see what's happened in other cities,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. `` Rouse has taken slums and turned them into landmarks,'' said <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON>, who is reopening <PERSON> Dante </PERSON>'s. `` And Underground <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was never as bad, at its worst, as any of those other areas were.'' Project officials maintain there's virtually no way Underground will fail. `` I'm convinced Underground is going to be a great success,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said, pointing out that while two developers put together the first Underground on a shoestring, this time the city is landlord, partner and major investor. `` The city leaders recognize how important it is, and they're not going to let it fail,'' he said. `` They just ca n't.''

<HEAD>Turnout At Politics-Weary Baptist Convention Expected to Be Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHERA GROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many Southern Baptists are expected to shun this year's denominational convention in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, because of the city's distance from Baptist enclaves and the reputation of the gamblers' paradise. Some may also do so because they're tired of the prolonged partisan strife in the 14.8 million-member denomination, the country's largest Protestant body. Although its annual conventions in recent years have attracted large crowds, hitting a high mark of 45,000 in 1985, only 13,000 to 15,000 are expected June 13-15 at the Las Vegas Convention Center. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, registration secretary, estimated the reduced attendance based on responses from congregations. Each may send a maximum number of delegates, called `` messengers,'' based on membership and financial contributions. For the last 10 years, huge turnouts have been spurred by the conflict going on between fundamentalist and moderate factions. Although the struggle continues, fatigue with it has become evident. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said there are a lot of other reasons for lessened attendance, the first being the `` extreme distance'' to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> from the area of Southern Baptist concentration, mostly in the South. `` The second reason our crowd is going to be down is that some of our churches and some of our leaders have a problem going to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> because of the reputation of the city,'' he said. Attendance typically is a family affair and many Baptists do n't want to bring their children to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and expose them to the city's seamier side While a previous convention approved meeting in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> this year, the choice had passed only by a narrow margin. Perhaps an underlying factor in the expected lower attendance is members' boredom with bickering between fundamentalists and moderates, who for 10 years have tried unsuccessfully to topple fundamentalist control. The key battle has been over the denominational presidency, but moderates, sometimes called centrists, so far have been unable to win it for a decade. The president appoints key committees which determine the personnel and policies of Southern Baptist agencies and institutions. While many Baptists are tired of the struggle, it shows no signs of abating. `` They do n't want to go and spend a week arguing,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. `` That's not good Christianity or good religion. You just do n't enjoy that. If attendance does drop, as <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> predicts, it might help moderates elect their candidate, the Rev. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vestal </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Dunwoody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. He is pitted against the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vines </PERSON>, the fundamentalist-backed president. He was elected last year and is unlikely to be unseated, since no incumbent who has sought a second term in recent history has been defeated. <PERSON> Vestal </PERSON> said he is is doubtful that a low turnout would help him. `` The faction that is now in control has just done an incredible job in getting the right types of messengers to the convention.'' <PERSON> Vestal </PERSON> describes himself as a political novice and said he simply represents a broad middle ground of philosophy. He added: `` There is not going to be unity until there is a kind of inclusion of all people in the process. The philosophy of the last 10 years basically says it's winner take all. There can be no unity in that type of attitude. `` A winner shares with all is my philosophy. I would include those in the present leadership and those who are not in the leadership. This is not between two individuals, but it is between two philosophies.'' Despite the conflict, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said most rank-and-file Baptists are n't interested. He said the convention generally is `` devoid of issues'' that attract attendance, adding that `` there is a lack of controversial issues and that produces a lack of interest.'' Vines said he questions whether boredom with the controversy has deterred attendance. He added in a telephone interview from his <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>: `` My perception is that the projection of lower attendance is more due to distance and economic considerations.'' Perhaps the strongest religious draw to the meeting will be a planned proselytism sweep of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> by about 2,000 Baptists trying to recruit residents to attend church, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. They hope to visit 30,000 to 35,000 homes on the Saturday before the convention begins. `` They are not going into the casinos. They are going into the homes where people live and try to give witness,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. No matter the turnout, <PERSON> Vestal </PERSON> said the centrist movement is not likely to stall in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said the centrists probably would have a better chance at the convention next year in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> since it is closer to their areas of strength such as in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. He added: `` Who wins the election depends on who comes and who is in the hall when the vote is taken.''

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> has been obsessed with getting drunks off the road since his son saw 27 people die when their church bus was hit last year by a truck driven by a man now charged with drunken driving and murder. Eighteen-year-old <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> `` was riding a bus behind the one that was hit near <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>. When he got home, he was still shaken by what he had seen and heard. Some of the kids that died were close to his age.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Transit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> bus driver for 11 years, `` sat down and wrote my company, suggesting that any of our drivers who spotted a drunk behind the wheel should alert the dispatcher to call police.'' The Transit Authority took <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s idea to police, who got $ 1,900 to pay for `` Drunk Buster on Board'' stickers for participating vehicles. The idea caught on, and and there now are approximately 5,000 volunteers like <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> area, all equipped with two-way radios. They are the anonymous tipsters who have made `` Drunk Busters'' a success in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and drawn the attention of law enforcers from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. `` We now have 25 firms involved and more should come on board later. There's such a diversity of spotters that the offender wo n't know whether the information leading to his arrest came from a guy behind the wheel of a cememt mixer or one driving a floral van,'' said police spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> Police have gotten more than 100 calls since Drunk Busters began in December _ seven months after the <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION> accident _ and while it would be difficult to track each tip in the courts, <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said drunken driving arrests are up 19.1 percent. There were 977 DUI arrests in the first quarter compared to 820 in the 1988 `` There is no doubt in my mind that Drunk Busters has been responsible for the increase. We're happy with the way things are going,'' he said. House, too, is happy about Drunk Busters' success. `` It's made the long arm of the law much longer.'' Police have gotten requests for information from around the country. One inquiry came from <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Feiner </PERSON>, a member of the <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, board of legislators who planned to recommend adopting the plan. `` I would consider the program a success if it gets just one deadly driver off the highway. I think it makes sense to get people to work with the police.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shedd </PERSON>, president of a beer distributor, was critical of Drunk Busters when it was unveiled just before the Christmas holidays. `` Our industry was under attack about that time and I thought this was another shot being fired at us,'' <PERSON> Shedd </PERSON> said. `` I had volunteered the services of my employees to help put out a packet covering drinking and driving.'' The packets went to motels, hotels and restaurants, and offered hints on how bartenders could recognize customers who had too much. <PERSON> Shedd </PERSON> understands the intent of Drunk Busters `` but the application bothered me.'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, 39, a former county corrections officer, has turned in three suspected drunken drivers recently. `` One of them had a can of beer between his legs and a case on the seat beside him.'' He and other men like <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON>, the owner of a 23-wrecker towing fleet, have learned to spot signs a motorist may be under the influence. `` They always slow down when they've had too much liquor. If the driver is going 25 mph in a 55 mph zone and he is n't elderly or half-blind, watch out,'' <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON> said. `` You also have to take a second look at the guy whose vehicle is weaving in the roadway, straddling the middle line or accelearating and decelarating rapidly.'' He said his employees have faithfully followed those guidelines and so far have made `` 25 to 30 calls under Drunk Busters.'' Because of the nature of his business, <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON> had doubts about joining the program. `` We're the only towing service in it, but we've never towed a drunk that we turned in,'' he said. Confidentiality helps Drunk Busters work, he said. `` It does n't set up a confrontation between my people and the motorist `` Our driver simply alerts the dispatcher and he passes along the license number and other information to the police.'' <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON> said his company responds to 18,000 calls a year. `` We see a lot of carnage. When a drunk is involved, it makes you angrier than usual.''

 Graceful exits are rare among players who reach the national political stage and have to leave before they're ready. Politicians tend to hang on past the applause, especially when they get into trouble. They linger, seeking vindication from colleagues or one more term from the voters _ sometimes both. Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coehlo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the Democratic whip, is an exception. Former Speaker of the House <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> took the more traveled course. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> resigned as speaker on Tuesday. He left with no apologies, in the manner of President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> 15 years ago. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he'd made mistakes _ `` Oh boy, how many?'' _ but he did not seem to count among them the ethics charges that brought him down. Like other politicians who have been forced from power, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he could have won, but resigned to avoid a long and damaging battle on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. But by the time he announced he would quit, on May 31, it was evident that he was going to lose. `` All things considered, it became obvious that short of an all-out harsh and bitter fight on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, it would be unrealistic to expect a complete exoneration, which is the only thing I was interested in,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Coehlo </PERSON> is resigning one week from today, his 47th birthday, rather than face an ethics investigation of his own. But for that cloud and the startling way he chose to dispel it, he would have become majority leader and, in all probability, a future speaker. <PERSON> Coehlo </PERSON>'s problem stemmed from a junk bond investment, made with borrowed money and aided by a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> savings and loan executive. It gained him all of $ 6,882. He said he regretted the deal, but that it was now fully disclosed and that he had violated no rules. <PERSON> Coehlo </PERSON> said he could have proved all that, but at a greater cost to him, his party and his causes than he was willing to pay. `` Some say this is not the type of mistake to do what you are doing,'' he said in <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, after announcing his resignation. `` I made a mistake. I'm willing to live with it and it's time to move on.'' He has n't said what he is going to do next. His resignation ends any prospect of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> inquiry into the 1986 junk bond deal, although the government still could investigate his conduct. That could work to his ultimate advantage if his conduct is cleared. His quick, clean break left political bridges intact, preserving the chance of a return to Democratic influence and, perhaps, public office. Few do. Until now, Republicans held the franchise for the most striking political departures of the era, the two-one resignations of Vice President <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> quit under criminal charges on Oct. 10, 1973. He pleaded no contest to income tax evasion and resigned as part of a plea bargain in which other charges were dropped and the government asked for leniency, not prison. Even so, he left with a familiar claim, saying he was sparing the country a distraction that could have dragged on for two or three years. `` As you are aware, the accusations against me can not be resolved without a long, divisive and debilitating struggle in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and in the courts,'' <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. Barely 10 months later, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> faced three impeachment charges before becoming the first president to resign. He had been forced by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to release a tape transcript that proved his involvement in the Watergate cover-up, despite two years of denials. So, he faced the television cameras and uttered `` the most difficult sentence I shall ever have to speak'' _ his resignation. In congressional ethics cases, the member in the dock often leaves with a warning to colleagues that they might be next. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> did n't make that explicit, although he called his fate `` mindless cannibalism'' and then said nobody should try to get even. When Sen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> was censured by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1967 for using political money to pay personal bills _ a practice since legalized in some cases _ he called it a grave mistake and injustice, and said such things could happen to others. He lost the next election, running as an independent because the Democrats did n't want him. His son, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, is a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> senator now. That was also the year the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> refused to seat Rep. <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on grounds he had misused $ 40,000 in congressional funds. He ran again, won again and got his seat back in 1969, even before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overruled his exclusion. Outright expulsions from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are rare. A member facing that ultimate sanction usually resigns when the outcome becomes inevitable. One who did not was Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, kicked out in 1980 for accepting a bribe in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s Abscam operation. One who did was Sen. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> in 1982. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, convicted of bribery and conspiracy in <LOCATION> Abscam </LOCATION>, quit after five days of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate that made clear he could n't win. He said he'd been the victim of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> setup that had put every senator at risk _ `` it is all of us, the entire <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' It was n't. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, then or now.

<HEAD>An Opportunity To Prepay Your Mortgage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As interest rates drop, smart homeowners with variable rate mortgages are preparing for a great leap forward by voluntarily raising their monthly payments. Such homeowners, and there are lots of them, exploit the cyclical nature of interest rates by accelerating their payments when rates are down and slowing them when rates rise, thus obtaining the greatest return for their dollar. Not everyone has the cash flow to do so, of course, but even small amounts can make a big difference when repeated for many months. Assuming a five-year cycle of high and low rates, some of these homeowners add to their payments for the 30 months or so when rates are lowest and then add nothing to their payments during the high end of the cycle. In such ways they can pare years from the maturity date of their loans. The theory is similar to what is practiced regularly in the stock market where wise investors buy when stock prices are low and avoid further commitments when prices are high, thus getting the most shares for the dollar. In real estate, homeowners in effect obtain more equity for the dollar by adding to their payments when their variable mortgage rates fall. In effect, such prepayments: _ `` Buy'' more equity for the buck. _ Accelerate the equity-loan ratio, or the amount of the monthly payment that goes to equity versus loan repayment Most of the payment in the first few months of a mortgage loan is to repay interest. As each month passes, more money is applied to equity and less to interest until, near maturity, the payments are almost all equity. By making additional payments, that process is hastened. Not only does the additional payment, in itself, lower the loan amount and add to the equity, but it `` jumps'' the homeowner into the more favorable equity-loan relationship. _ Shrink the mortgage maturity date _ perhaps, for example, from 20 years to 18 _ saving thousands of dollars of interest payments All three of these benefits are simply different ways of saying the same thing, that when you speed up repayments, especially when rates are at the low point in the cycle, you can save substantial sums. Unless drastic changes occur in the way the American economy operates, such opportunities will present themselves at least two or three times in a 20-year period. Economies are cyclical, forever expanding or contracting. During the old days of fixed-rate mortgages, homeowners did n't have the opportunity to take advantage of these cycles No matter what happened to rates in general, borrowers were locked into their initial contract rates. Variable rates were developed primarily because lenders wanted them for their own protection. Why, they reasoned, should they be locked into low rates for long terms when their own costs of obtaining money might rise? Lenders thus obtained the protection they sought, but in so doing they also left an opening for savvy homeowners. There is nothing in most mortgage contracts written today to prevent borrowers from taking advantage of the low end of the interest-rate cycle. Even for bankers, it seems, security comes at a price.

<HEAD>Southern Baptist Candidates Partly Agree, But Not Mainly</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Laserphoto</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Both say that they want to cool it, to stop the battling. Both take a fundamentalist view of the Bible. Both affirm friendship. But they're poised for a fight over the nature of Southern Baptists. Both claim to represent the genuine Baptist way, the authentic heritage. But the two candidates for the denomination's presidency disagree strongly about principles essential to that heritage. It's a conflict that has gone on for a decade in the nation's biggest Protestant denomination, numbering l4 .8 Its presidency holds sway over makeup of its operating personnel. Filling that powerful top post is the key decision for the denomination's convention June 13-15 in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> determining whether fundamentalists will keep the office for an 11th straight year. Their incumbent candidate, the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vines </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, seeks a second term, calling for peace in the ranks. `` I have made a conscious effort to create an atmosphere where healing and reconciliation could occur,'' he says. His challenger, the Rev. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vestal </PERSON> of suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, backed by moderates, also calls himself a peacemaker, a `` responsible reconciler, a bridge to call our people back together.'' While both speak of `` peace,'' however, both also declare their adherence to differing positions on principles considered basic for Baptists, involving the latitude of condoned doctrinal freedom. On that, Vines sets certain limits on what is acceptable, primarily about the Bible but impinging on many other issues, while <PERSON> Vestal </PERSON> insists on greater room for acceptable differences. `` We have certain parameters which are overwhelmingly accepted in Southern Baptist life,'' Vines says, adding that he has confined his appointments to those whose beliefs are within those approved `` parameters.'' <PERSON> Vestal </PERSON> says this has clamped on `` a kind of tight control'' demanding allegiance to it. `` Our freedom is being threatened,'' he says. `` It has to stop ... or we are going to destroy this denomination.'' Vines, 51, a native Georgian, has been pastor of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, for the last seven years. <PERSON> Vestal </PERSON>, 44, a Texan, led the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, for 12 years, before becoming pastor of suburban <LOCATION> Dunwoody </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> last fall. Weighing against <PERSON> Vestal </PERSON>'s bid is a longtime convention custom, unvarying in modern history, of always giving the incumbent a second term. Vines also is riding a fundamentalist tide. Its appointive authority, surpassing that of any post in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christianity </ORGANIZATION>, determines trustees that control the denomination's 26 agencies and institutions with budgets totalling about $ 400 million annually. `` In my second year,'' <PERSON> Vines </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, `` I would emphasize building soul-winning churches, and I would like to lead our convention to a renewed emphasis on church growth. `` We have settled the debate over the nature of Scripture. Now it is time to move into a new era of growth in our local churches.'' <PERSON> Vestal </PERSON> says that `` humanly speaking, it is not likely that I will be elected, although I'm going to try.'' If he does win, he says he would seek a limitation on presidential powers to `` de-politicize'' that office. `` The pattern of the last 10 years has been basically a philosophy of winner-take all,'' he says. `` My philosophy would be that the winner shares all.'' Curiously, both Vines and <PERSON> Vestal </PERSON> espouse `` biblical inerrancy,''' meaning Scripture is literally without error historically, religiously or scientifically. However, Vines' policy has restricted appointments to persons inside those `` parameters.'' Linked to the paramenters have been various social positions such as against divorced personnel, abortion or ordaining women. <PERSON> Vestal </PERSON> says his `` appointments would be from a different perspective. I would include all Southern Baptists'' on both sides of the prolonged conflict. He says that he himself is an `` inerrantist'' about the Bible, but also is a `` centrist'' who accepts differing approaches under the Baptist principle of the right of believers to interpret Scripture as each understands it. Vines, seeking to deflect sharp conflict from the convention, has asked the executive committee to postpone action on a highly controversial proposal to establish a separate <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, religious-liberty arm. It would be an alternative to the current agency in which nine Baptist bodies cooperate, the <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Public Affairs. Fundamentalists have assailed it as not adhering to their social agenda. Vines says he wants the matter deferred so the convention can focus on evangelism and be `` as positive and united as possible.'' <PERSON> Vestal </PERSON>, who has campaigned in church meetings in several states, says he wants the convention to return to its `` time-honored principles'' such as local church autonomy and `` priesthood of believers'' emphasizing their equal rights. `` We have forsaken basic principles,'' he says. `` It is a power or control issue, and Southern Baptists have got to resist it. We have got to stand up and say enough is enough.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the young pianist whose music has been rattling chandeliers at the city's swankier jazz joints, planned to do just one thing before the biggest gig of his life, a sold-out show at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` Pray,'' said the 21-year-old <PERSON> Connick </PERSON>. On the day of the concert, he'd sleep the day away, go to the little Catholic church around the corner and ask for some divine guidance. The day before the May 6 <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> performance, he's up before dawn to appear on a morning TV news show. He'll be playing in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that night. He's fighting a case of strep throat and, since he sings during a good portion of his performances, he's worried that his voice wo n't hold for the big show the following night `` Hopefully, I'll have my chops back,'' <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> says, rubbing his throat with his huge hands. `` This is awful. It's like I can sing but I have no control.'' His <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> studio apartment is littered with tiny throat lozenge wrappers, most of them crumpled in a pile on the mantle of his grand piano, which takes up a good part of the space. It's a gray day, and the studio is lighted only by the muted sun streaming in the window. The only glow comes from <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> who beams when he talks about his favorite topics: music and singing. Lately he's been practicing all night and, he says, `` praying is the only thing that can help me now.'' It's a tactic that's served him well. Relying on religion, in part, brought him from a rich bog of musicial influences in his native <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> to the splendor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Tully </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. He arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at age 18, got a room at the local <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> and within a month had a job playing the piano in a church. Then another church in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> needed a choir director. After that, gigs at `` little dives here and there'' led to others; the joints got classier, the pianos better tuned. Three years later, he has two albums out with <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> _ the first called `` <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'' and the second `` 20,'' as in his age at the time. Earlier this year, he had a successful and often sold-out run at the famed Algonquin Hotel. His repertoire relies heavily on nostalgia: <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON>'s `` If I Only Had a Brain''; <PERSON> Hoagy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON>'s `` Lazy River''; and <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s `` In Other Words'' -LRB- also called `` Fly Me to the Moon'' -RRB-. <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> finds the whole notion of today's popular music distressing. `` They do n't understand,'' said <PERSON> Connick </PERSON>, his trademark slick ash-blond hair bobbing back and forth, referring to no one in particular and everyone in general who produces and performs trendy tunes. `` There was just an innocence which is lost in American society today. Can you imagine how nice it would have been, back in the'40s? The innocence they had back then _ there is such a joyousness about the music back then.'' Still, his passion for the past leaves many puzzled. `` People always say, ` Harry why do you do all those old songs?' I would just run out of songs to play,'' <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> said of his first days as a performer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> when he'd be pressed to play for hours on end. `` I would hear a song like ` Somewhere Over the Rainbow,' by <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> and I would say, ` That sure is a pretty song. I'm going to buy all his music.' Then I started reading his music and realized he wrote ` Come Rain or Come Shine,' ` That Old Black Magic,' ` It's Only a Paper Moon' and a bunch of other songs that are really great `` Not only lyrically are they wonderful to sing, but the melodies are so perfect,'' <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> said. `` No one writes like that now.'' He denies he's on a revival trip, and says his polished image _ big, pouty lips, slicked back short hair and loose-fitting suits _ is n't calculated. `` I did n't say, ` What can I do to market myself? I got it! I'll slick my hair back, wear baggy suits and sing songs from the 40s. Everything just happened coincidentally.'' Not completely. Growing up near <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' bohemian French Quarter with parents who loved to indulge their boy's musicial aspirations, helped make the package of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> what it is today. He made his first public performance when he was 5 for his father's inauguration as the city's district attorney. `` I got up there and I remember hearing that applause and I said, ` I got ta have more of that! Where can I get more of that?''' In his quest for a big, happy audience, he began to study a host of musicial influences _ rhythm and blues, honky-tonk, bebop and stride. Stride is a devilish piano style that requires one hand to race across the keyboard at a furious speed while the other one pounds away at a different tempo. He began to incorporate sounds from other artists including <PERSON> Erroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hines </PERSON>, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>, Thelonius Monk and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Prima </PERSON>. Under the tutelage of jazz pianist <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsalis </PERSON> -LRB- father of <LOCATION> Wynton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Branford </LOCATION> -RRB-, <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> began to master bebop. The <PERSON> Marsalis </PERSON> family played a large role in <PERSON> Connick </PERSON>'s young career. <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> admits one of the reasons he moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was to be near his friend <PERSON> Wynton </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsalis </PERSON>, the Grammy-winning jazz and classical trumpeter. <PERSON> Delfeayo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsalis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wynton </PERSON>'s brother, produced <PERSON> Connick </PERSON>'s first album, which was recorded in one afternoon in January 1987. But on this day, ballads were on <PERSON> Connick </PERSON>'s mind. He said he'd been listening to a piece by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> from the album `` In the Wee Small Hours'' over and over again He jumps up and plays it to explain a nuance of the pain he hears in <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>'s voice and how he hopes to one day be able to sing a ballad as well. `` He's saying, ` I get along without you very well, of course I do.''' <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> said. `` He's being sarcastic. `` Now listen,'' he adds, reciting the lyrics along with the music: `` Except when soft rains call and the drip of the leaves, then I recall the thrill of being sheltered in your arms, of course I do.'' <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> stares off and gets a melancholy look in his eyes. `` These days they just do n't understand,'' he said.

 When <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> was first offered his role in the <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> movie `` Traveling Man,'' he loathed the character. `` I enjoyed the script but I could n't see myself in it,'' he said. `` It called for someone in his late 20s, cocky and a Southerner. I read it again. I really hated <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. `` But the more I hated him the more I loved him. Then when I heard <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lithgow </PERSON> was also going to play the older salesman I was thrilled.'' <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> is a pushy, opportunistic young hustler ready to steal his mentor's sales route out from under him in the <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> film, premiering Sunday. <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> is best known for playing `` nice Jewish boys,'' most particularly <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> in playwright <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s autobiographical trilogy, `` <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> Memoirs,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Biloxi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blues </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` Broadway Bound. <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> played the role on Broadway, and in the movie version of `` Brighton Beach Memoirs.'' `` Traveling Man,'' described as a combination of `` Death of a Salesman'' and `` Tin Men,'' was written five years ago by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. The crackerjack movie, with fine performances all around, had kicked around so long, because it was n't considered commercial enough, until it was picked up by Home Box Office. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cluett </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lithgow </PERSON> -RRB- is a middle-aged salesman of industrial foam in the deep South whose spectacular sales record hits a slump. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> is the district sales manager with an evangelical fury and a heart of stone. <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> induces <PERSON> Cluett </PERSON> to take along rookie salesman <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> to show him the ropes. What <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> has in mind is to hang <PERSON> Cluett </PERSON> from the ropes and take over his lucrative route. <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kershner </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Empire Strikes Back,'' `` The Flim-Flam Man'' -RRB- directed. The movie was shot in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. It also stars <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> as a caring woman <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> meets during <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON>. `` I've never played a character as shady or with such evil intentions as <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> said during a break in shooting his next movie, `` Sketches,'' also starring <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>. `` He's a very complex character, but he has to come across as naive and innocent until he sticks it to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lithgow </PERSON>. `` He's thoroughly messed up <PERSON> Ben </PERSON>'s life, but when <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> gets into trouble <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> comes back and rescues him. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lithgow </PERSON>'s my idol. It was a thrill to work with him, but it was difficult to yell at him and hit him.'' <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and was 17 when he landed the role in `` <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> Beach Memoirs'' in 1983, replacing <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>. `` Working in ` <ORGANIZATION> Brighton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memoirs </ORGANIZATION>' was my first job and my first time away from home,'' he said. `` I'd never intended to become an actor. It was just something I'd done in high school. My passion was playing baseball, and I went back and forth between baseball and drama. An agent saw me in a school play and called me. I thought it was a friend playing a joke. He sent me on an audition and that's how I was cast in the play. His other film credits include `` Stealing Home,'' `` Caddyshack II,'' `` Girls Just Want to Have Fun,'' and `` Weekend at <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON>'s.'' He was on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> series `` Gim me a Break'' in 1984-86. The producers had a role written for him after seeing him on stage. In `` Weekend at <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON>'s,'' which will be released in July, <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> play two insurance agents who stumble across some information on a crime. They tell their boss, who turns out to be the crook. `` The boss invites us to his beach house so he can have the Mafia kill us,'' <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> said. `` But they kill him instead, so it's two guys with a body. There's a party going on in the house and no one else is aware he's dead. It's a very black comedy.'' What's next for <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>? `` I'm being offered a lot of things,'' he said. `` I usually have to fight for things. This is a lovely time. But I have n't decided yet what to accept.''

<HEAD>Star Watch: Paramount Hopes For Another `Trek' Into Profits </HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The allure of `` Star Trek'' has long delighted its followers and confounded its detractors. Star <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatner </PERSON> has an explanation. `` Is it possible that we're creating a mythology, that we touch a mythological vein somewhere? The more I read and the more I think about it, I wonder if the key to ` Star Trek' is not all the wonderful stuff we talk about: the character interplay, the sci-fi, action and adventure and all those good things that seem to be on the surface,'' he said. `` Somewhere underneath, the chemistry and the concept touch upon a mythological need in modern culture. That's my real thought. I do n't quite know what I mean. It would take a far more intelligent and perceptive person to divine what I mean.'' <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> takes a far less intellectual view of the phenomenon. The company still makes nice rentals on the 1960s TV series, and `` Star Trek: The Next Generation'' has prospered in syndication. A $ 50 million gamble on the 1979 `` Star Trek: The Motion Picture'' paid off handsomely. `` Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home'' was the highest moneymaker of the series, earning $ 57 million in rentals. Now comes `` Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,'' directed by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatner </PERSON>. Why would he want to take on the onerous job of guiding an immensely complicated production? `` Directing a film is the end of the rainbow,'' he said in an interview. `` You've seen those T-shirts: ` What I really want to do is direct.' What I really want to do is direct. I've directed several stage plays, some television. I thought that directing a huge, large-budget motion picture might be something that would be the culmination of all my efforts. `` I was indeed the culmination of my career _ I do n't know if this will be the end of my career. It is certainly the top moment of my life, and it was everything I hoped it would be.'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimoy </PERSON>, who directed `` The Voyage Home'' as well as `` Three Men and a Baby'' and `` The Good Mother,'' gives his co-star good marks as a director. `` I think he's terrific,'' <PERSON> Nimoy </PERSON> said. `` He has a quality which is wonderful. It's an almost childlike desire to entertain, to tell a story, to capture your attention, to surprise you and touch you, make you laugh. He wants to do that: to be a fun storyteller. That kind of exuberance will serve him well.'' <PERSON> Nimoy </PERSON> also discussed the difference in their directorial styles. `` The joke is that in a <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatner </PERSON> film he does a lot more running and jumping,'' he said. `` He's much more physical as a person than I am. I've always been a lot more sedentary, always made more cerebral choices in my acting. He makes more physical choices. He would rather do a chase than a conversation.'' `` The Final Frontier'' was <PERSON> Shatner </PERSON>'s baby from the beginning. He submitted a 14-page original story about a messianic leader who kidnaps the Enterprise and its crew and takes them to a faraway land where he believes God resides. Producer <PERSON> Harve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> approved his story idea, and the pair worked on the plot with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Loughery </PERSON>, who wrote the script. Production was stalled by two industry strikes and <PERSON> Nimoy </PERSON>'s commitment to direct `` The Good Wife. `` The Final Frontier'' had only 18 weeks in post-production, <PERSON> Shatner </PERSON> said, which was about one-third of what was needed. The speed may have contributed to bad previews which were reported in the press. The movie was retooled for its wide release on June 9. With all of his directorial duties, was <PERSON> Shatner </PERSON> the actor neglected? `` Interesting,'' he mused. `` If I had been handed this script and somebody else was directing, I probably have gone in and said, ` Look, I do n't think the character is quite focussed.' `` I might have shortchanged myself as the egotistical actor. Let me rephrase that. I do n't mean egotistical in the bad sense; I mean in the actor whose sole point of view is the character. `` My job when hired for Capt. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> was to keep my focus on Capt. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, to protect Capt. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, to make him as exciting and make him move as well as possible,'' he said. `` I did n't want to do that with this film. I wanted to open myself up and make sure the other characters were not only protected but a great deal was made of them.'' <PERSON> Shatner </PERSON>, 58, is a Canadian, born and reared in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. He started acting early. `` I began at the age of six, acting in camp plays,'' he related. `` I continued in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> amateur theatricals as a teen-ager. I put myself through college with radio work. I went to the professional theater when I graduated from the university -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> McGill </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, stayed in the professional theater through thick and thin. I've never done anything else but act, write and direct.'' Trained in the classics at the <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> <PERSON> Festival </PERSON>, he made his Broadway debut in the festival's `` Tamburlaine the Great.'' <PERSON> Shatner </PERSON> became one of the busiest actors in live TV dramas, won an <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> contract and made his film debut in `` The <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Karamazov </ORGANIZATION>.'' For a time he bounced between the theater -LRB- `` The World of <PERSON> Suzie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>,'' `` A Shot in the Dark'' -RRB-, films -LRB- `` Judgment at <LOCATION> Nuremberg </LOCATION>,'' `` The Outrage'' -RRB- and television -LRB- `` For the People'' -RRB-. In 1965, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Roddenberry </PERSON> produced a pilot of a new space series starring <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> as Capt. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> gave it thumbs down, declaring it too cerebral. <PERSON> Roddenberry </PERSON> shot a second pilot for `` Star Trek,'' casting <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatner </PERSON> as Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> in what became something of a lifetime job.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks are tightening lending guidelines for Chinese-foreign business ventures because of the civil strife that threatens to engulf <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and American companies are accelerating their retreat from the country. Reversing its position of a day earlier, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday it was evacuating expatriates and was among the first companies to charter a plane for the pullout. The <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> workers included 43 from a <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> factory that assembles MD-80 twinjets, seven workers based in the southwest city of <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> and one representative in the northeast city of <LOCATION> Shenyang </LOCATION>. `` We've changed our situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

Several other companies also ordered employees to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and scrapped business trips there because of the growing fear of civil war. The intensified effort to get employees out reflected the deteriorating situation in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> since the weekend, when soldiers killed hundreds of unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators and other civilians. Protests have flared in other cities and it has become unclear if anyone is running the country. In another sign that the chaos may have a widening and profound economic impact, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks began reviewing credit to companies that do business with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and shortened time limits on new loans for trade and investment projects. `` We're doing something all banks are doing, just making sure any new commitments and any renewed commitments are kept very short-term, three months or less,'' said an official of one major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bank, who asked not to be identified by name. An official of another big <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bank, who also requested anonymity, said: `` It's obvious that any sensible country-risk process would be operative under present conditions and commitments would be reviewed.'' <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> are among some of the prominent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banking companies with offices in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Many established representative offices there after relations were normalized a decade ago. The banks' main role is to expedite financing for joint ventures between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Chinese companies, but their direct loans to the Chinese are considered inconsequential and are n't reported in their accounting statements.

 A <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> television station was not required to tell viewers that a toy maker was providing a children's program in exchange for free advertising time, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ruled The commission, in a ruling Tuesday that uphold's the common industry practice of `` barter'' sales, denied a complaint that <ORGANIZATION> KCOP-TV </ORGANIZATION> should have identified <ORGANIZATION> Mattel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and TV syndicator Group W Productions as the sponsors of the animated cartoon show, `` He-Man and the Masters of the Universe.'' The Los-Angeles based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> had characterized the children's fantasy show as a non-stop depiction of `` He-Man'' logo and `` He-Man'' toy products, which are made by <ORGANIZATION> Mattel </ORGANIZATION>. The association said the barter arrangement, whereby <ORGANIZATION> Mattel </ORGANIZATION> and Group W provided `` He-Man'' in exchange for two minutes of commercials distributed throughout <ORGANIZATION> KCOP </ORGANIZATION>'s children's program schedule, constituted a `` token payment,'' given the cost of producing the shows. The association said the producers spent $ 14 million to make 65 episodes of the program. The association, in a 1984 complaint, said Section 317 of the 1934 Communications Act requires that sponsors be identified whenever shows are provided free or with only nominal payment. But <ORGANIZATION> KCOP </ORGANIZATION> valued the commercial time at $ 300,000 a year. At the same time, it said that even if the payment were deemed `` token,'' Section 317 does not require sponsor identification when the sponsors are mentioned incidentally or not at all in the broadcast. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 denied the complaint, which had been joined by Action for Children's Television. <ORGANIZATION> NABB </ORGANIZATION> appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which in September 1987 remanded the case to the commission. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> denied the complaint again Tuesday. `` I guess it would be amazing if they had voted any other way,'' <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Charren </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, said of the 3-0 FCC ruling. She said the problem of advertising messages slipped into TV programs was `` one of the sorriest problems in all of broadcasting'' and that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> was saying they are `` going to let everything relax on the subject of advertising and editorial content.'' <ORGANIZATION> NABB </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Orme </PERSON> said his group would continue the fight. `` Whatever they have done, the court will have to approve,'' <PERSON> Orme </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` I think eventually we will win this.'' <PERSON> Charren </PERSON>'s group, which helped write a bill pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would re-impose limits on the amount of commercials on kids' shows, had said various broadcasters were violating FCC regulations by airing `` He-Man'' and seven other programs with substantial product tie-ins But the commission, in its 1985 ruling, said such the shows were not program-length commericials. The commission said the broadcasters `` had made a good faith determination that ` He-Man' and the other challenged programs possessed significant entertainment value for child audiences.'' The appeals court said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> had interpreted Section 317 incorrectly and it instructed the agency to devise a standard to determine if Section 317 covers barter arrangements. In its ruling Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> admitted it erred when it said Section 317 applied only to broadcasts that were purely commercial in content. As for determining a standard, it said <ORGANIZATION> KCOP </ORGANIZATION> clearly had paid more than a nominal fee for `` He-Man,'' and Section 317, therefore, did not apply. The commission said it was not its business to `` engage in a detailed review of the adequacy of a broadcaster's payment in every case in which a program discount is alleged.'' It such such an approach would `` not necessarily further the statutory objectives, is unlikely to yield conclusive results and could require disclosures that cause substantial competitive harm to program suppliers.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar edged up against the Japanese yen Wednesday morning, while share prices erased early gains and declined on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost 5.07 points Tuesday, lost another 15.04 points, or 0.04 percent, to finish the morning session at 33,436.97. The dollar was trading at late morning at 142.88 yen, after opening lower at 142.45 yen, down 0.18 yen from Tuesday's close of 142.63 yen. The currency moved in the range of 142.40 to 143.00 yen. There were two main incentives in the foreign exchange market Wednesday: an incentive to buy due to the turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and one to sell sparked by a prime rate cut by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks, said <PERSON> Mitsuhiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinugawa </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. He said the buying pressure due to the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was stronger. Investors tend to purchase dollars in times of uncertainty or crisis. `` Although Japanese investors do n't have a feeling of emergency, they are buying because of reactions overseas,'' he said. Many market players believe the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has been easing its monetary policy since major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks lowered their prime lending rate by 0.5 percentage point to 11 percent Monday. The trader said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> intervened in the market by selling the dollar to support the yen. He said the amount of the bank's selling was unknown. The central bank does not comment on its monetary activities. On the stock market, the index fell marginally mainly due to selling for profit-taking after earlier gains, while the majority of market players remained on the sidelines. Other traders said turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> contributed to the wait-and-see mood in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market. Japanese goverment has urged the swift evacuation of Japanese residents in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Many Japanese businesses in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have closed temporarily and brought employees back to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and other independent petroleum producers will proceed with plans to cut exports by 5 percent even if <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> raises production as expected, the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> said. The government news service <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday quoted <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> <PERSON> Segura </PERSON>, assistant commercial director for the government oil monopoly <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>, as saying the cuts would not significantly hurt business. <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> said that during the first five months of this year <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> already has exceeded its profit estimates for all of 1989 by 40 percent. <PERSON> Robles </PERSON>' remarks came as <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> tried to restart stalled negotiations over a new production and pricing agreement. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> does not belong to the 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and is not governed by the group's agreements. However, it historically has followed cartel guidelines. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> talks had centered on how to divide any additional production among the member countries. The ministers seemed to agree on lifting production levels to 19.5 million barrels a day, or at most 20 million barrels a day, in the last six months of the year. The ceiling in the January-June period is 18.5 million barrels daily. A <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> statement released Tuesday quoted <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> as saying he was confident that an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production cap would help maintain petroleum prices worldwide. <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> said that during the first five months of this year, <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> exported a daily average of 1.3 million barrels of crude oil with an average price of $ 15.32 a barrel.

 <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, today announced it is pulling out of the country after 42 years and selling its assets to a South African company. A combination of economic and political factors were responsible for <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to divest its Uitenhage, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, tire and general products manufacturing operation. The business will be sold to <ORGANIZATION> Consol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION>, an industrial subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Anglovaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a South African financial, industrial and mining group. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the company regrets leaving <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> after providing jobs there for more than four decades. But, in an announcement of the sale, he stated: `` It is becoming increasingly difficult for American companies to obtain adequate returns on investments there.'' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said the reasons for <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>'s disinvestment included <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, double <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxation of South African earnings and the likelihood of a continuing decline in the value of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> rand against major currencies. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in late 1987 enacted legislation that eliminates a tax credit for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies that allowed them to deduct taxes paid to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> against taxes owed to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. The former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposed the amendment and considered fighting to have it repealed, but it remains the law. Former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said at the time the bill was passed that `` the most likely effect will be to accelerate the takeover of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets by South African firms at bargain prices.'' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Anglovaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> was a reponsible group that had demonstrated concern for human rights in the workplace and had expressed intentions to retain the current workforce of 2,400 people, the majority of whom are black and colored. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, chairman and managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>'s South African business, said the company would continue to operate under the same management. `` We have always taken great pride in our people and our management team and employees have vast knowledge of the local tire and rubber industry,'' said <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>. `` For them, we will continue to operate under present employment policies, practices and benefits and all existing agreements and arrangements with our two trade unions remain unaltered.'' <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> began manufacturing tires in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1947, the year before the South African government adopted the apartheid policy of racial separation. Over the years, <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> took the position that it could contribute to social progress in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by maintaining its operations in the country. The company says it has spent more than $ 10 million in education and training of blacks, housing and social programs in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> has adhered to the <LOCATION> Sullivan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Principles </LOCATION>, a set of guidelines for companies operating in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that address employment and other practices. However, <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> stated, `` with the prospect of ever-diminishing returns on our South African investment, our responsibility to our shareholders must take precedence.'' The sale will result in a one-time charge of about $ 44 million, after taxes, or 77 cents a share, which will be taken against <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>'s second-quarter results. Over the past five years, excluding <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>, 195 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies have divested their holdings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Larosiere </PERSON> said Wednesday that the top seven industrialized nations continue to cooperate to keep exchange rates stable despite recent volatility in world markets. `` There has been some volatility over the past month,'' he told a bankers' forum. `` But what is important is that the international cooperation put in play since 1985 is still operating. `` The seven major countries are on the same wave-length and do understand the problems in the same fashion,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Larosiere </PERSON> said at the end of the three-day <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> attended by members of 99 comercial banks from 22 countries. He said the major task of the cooperation was to keep inflation down and sustain current economic growth. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Larosiere </PERSON> made the remarks to reporters after a closed meeting with private bankers and central bank governors or senior officials of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Sir <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plc </ORGANIZATION>, moderated the central bankers' discussion and appeared later before reporters. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohl </PERSON> participated in the closed-door panel but did not attend the press briefing. <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> said <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> had told the bankers it was difficult to correctly evaluate the recent rise in the dollar's value. But he said <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> indicated the dollar's rise appeared to be more of a market phenomenon than the result of fundamental economic factors. <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> said the central bank officials did not believe the dollar `` was likely to go raging on.'' The Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh-Pemberton </PERSON> sai, `` The degree of currency stability is still reasonably satisfactory'' if seen from the view of whether it inhibits cross-border investment. He added that the markets had seemed to incorrectly imply that the international coordination policy on exchange rates `` had given up.'' <PERSON> Takeshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohta </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy governor for international relations, said policy coordination among the major nations does not always mean taking measures `` at the same time in the same direction.'' But he said, `` We should be able to move swifly when necessary.'' He and de Larosiere expressed concern over too much emphasis being placed on monetary policy to attempt to cut back economic imbalances.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers today held a flurry of bargaining sessions to try to break a deadlock in negotiations for a new production and pricing agreement. `` We are working toward an agreement for sure,'' said Iraqi Oil Minister <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Raheem </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Chalabi </PERSON>. The ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries held private meetings in their hotel rooms in late morning and early afternoon. They took a break after lunch and planned further discussions in late afteroon. `` We are consulting with each other and hope to reach an agreement,'' said <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>'s minister, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Thani </PERSON>. He predicted a deal could be struck within the next two days. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> raised the possibility that all 13 ministers would gather at cartel headquarters later in the day to resume their formal strategy session. The ministers opened their mid-year conference on Monday, then broke up to bargain privately. The talks have stalled over a Kuwaiti demand for a much larger share of any increase in cartel production in the last half of the year. Other members, including influential <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, want the increase shared proportionately among all the members. `` A lot of work needs to be done,'' Iranian Oil Minister <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` We need about one or two days for consultations,'' <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said. A delegate from one nation, who demanded anonymity, said, `` It's a deadlock. The ministers seemed in agreement on lifting their production cap to 19.5 million barrels a day, or at most 20 million barrels a day, in the last six months of the year. The ceiling in the January-June period is 18.5 million barrels a day. The ministers also appeared to have settled on retaining their benchmark price of $ 18 a barrel. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> had recommended getting rid of the target price. The cartel late last year agreed on its supply ceiling of 18.5 million barrels a day for the January-June period, well under output levels at that time. Cutbacks earlier in the year helped drive prices beyond the cartel's $ 18 benchmark. Prices have eased a bit recently as <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has turned up its production. But the price of a basket of crudes monitored by the cartel was still more than 40 percent above the level of late November. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the contract for July delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, has been trading at more than $ 20 a 42-gallon barrel. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, reported that the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations lifted their crude production by 500,000 barrels a day in May to 21 million barrels, the highest so far this year. `` This was primarily the result of higher production in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, partly offset by a small decline in Iranian and Ecuadorian production,'' it said. The slippage in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s output, it said, was due to a landslide that damaged the country's main oil pipeline. The agency's Monthly Oil Market Report predicted demand for the cartel's oil would rise in the second half of the year to about 20.85 million barrels a day. The agency previously estimated demand for the period at 20.4 million barrels a day.

 <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> shares shot higher in early trading today in response to a $ 6.5 billion takeover offer by <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The $ 120-a-share unsolicitated offer, disclosed after stock trading closed late Tuesday, would solidify <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s position as the nation's largest cellular telephone company. In national over-the-counter trading early today, <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> was up $ 24.25 a share to $ 127.25. <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 2.50 to $ 45.75 a share. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>, which is LIN's largest shareholder with a 9.8 percent stake, has franchises serving customers in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. New York-based LIN operates seven network-affiliated television stations and has interests in cellular systems serving <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> It also owns a specialty publishing house that produces hard-cover tourist guides for hotel rooms. <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement it would `` study the offer carefully and act in the best interests of its shareholders.'' There had been speculation for months that <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> would launch an offer for LIN. LIN announced two weeks ago that its board had approved in principle spinning off all of the stock in a new subsidiary that would own its TV stations. It said it would operate its cellular operations along with a specialty publishing business as a separate company. LIN said the move was made for operating and strategic reasons due to the differences in the nature of the television and cellular-phone industries. The <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> proposal was seen by industry analysts as a recognition of the premium that the stock market has placed on the fast-growing cellular business. `` Given the regional geographic and operational nature of the cellular business, the logic of combining our two companies is compelling,'' <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said in a letter to Lin Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pels </PERSON>. In the letter, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> called the $ 6.5 billion bid `` the highest price per ` pop' in the history of our -LRB- cellular -RRB- industry.''

<HEAD>Court Blocks Dock Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Court of Appeal on Wednesday granted British port employers an injunction banning a national dock strike. The strike had been planned for sometime this summer by 9,400 dockers affected by the British government's plans to abolish a job guarantee scheme. The Court of Appeal's verdict overturns an earlier decision by the <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> which refused to outlaw a dock strike. The Transport and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents dockworkers, is expected to appeal the verdict to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s highest court, the House of Lords. Since the government first announced its intention to abolish the dock labor scheme, under which employees are guaranteed lifelong job security, a dispute has raged between employers and unions over whether strike action would constitute a `` political protest'' against the government or a genuine `` trade dispute.'' Under the 1982 Employment Act, political disputes are illegal. Last month, dockworkers at 46 British ports voted overwhelmingly in favor of striking against the government's proposals.

<HEAD>Government Announces Sale of Short Brothers to Canada's Bombardier</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates throughout with financial and other details.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said today it would sell <ORGANIZATION> Short </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the ailing <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> aircraft and missile maker, to the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> aerospace company <ORGANIZATION> Bombardier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for 30 million pounds, about $ 47 million. The announcement ended months of speculation over who would buy the state-owned company, which is <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s largest employer, after the government said it planned to privatize it. The <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Office said <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Bombardier </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaudoin </PERSON> reached a formal agreement in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> this morning. As part of the deal, the government has pledged to invest `` a substantial amount'' in Short Brothers, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. The government will inject 372 million pounds -LRB- $ 584 million -RRB- into <LOCATION> Short </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brothers </LOCATION> and write off a 390 million-pound -LRB- $ 612 million -RRB- loan it made to Shorts earlier this year to help the company pay its debts. The injection is subject to the approval of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, but the Conservative government has a parliamentary majority that virtually assures approval. `` Bombardier recognizes the important position occupied by Shorts in the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> economy and intends to acquire the company as a long-term investment and to maintain it as a complete entity,'' Northern Ireland Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. `` Its objective is to develop the three main divisions of aircraft, aerostructures and missiles,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. Under the agreement, the Shorts name will be retained and the company will be kept intact for the foreseeable future, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. But he said he could not guarantee all jobs would be retained. `` In the end nobody can absolutely guarantee jobs to anybody. If a business is not competitive, if in spite of new investment, in spite of new products, there is not the commitment and performance and it is not competitive, then there can not be any guarantee of jobs,'' he said. The acquisition was expected to be completed later in the year, subject to approval by Office of Fair Trading and <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Short </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> announced it was laying off 700 workers, bringing the work force to 7,000, because of heavy losses. The company lost $ 223 million lin 1988 and another loss is expected this year. Short Brothers' most successful arm is its missile division but it also makes its own passenger short-haul airliners, the 360 36-seater, and the 330 30-seater, as well as aircraft components for other companies. <ORGANIZATION> Bombardier </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, is a manufacturer of mass transport vehicles. Its best known products are the Challenger series of business, cargo and commuter aircraft made by its Canadair aircraft manufacturing company. <ORGANIZATION> Bombardier </ORGANIZATION> has a 46-seat regional commuter aircraft under development, the only serious rival to Shorts' FJX twin-engined regional jetliner project, which now is to be scrapped. <ORGANIZATION> Bombardier </ORGANIZATION> also is involved in research and development of missile components and pilotless surveillance aircraft.

<TEXT>
 After several weeks of internal debate, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has taken a cautious first step toward lowering interest rates, many economists believe. The action, if followed by further moves by the central bank to loosen its grip on credit, will spell lower borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, including declines in mortgage rates, the economists said. A move to lower interest rates would mark a major policy shift by the central bank, which launched a campaign in March 1988 to push interest rates higher in order to fight inflation. Federal Reserve Governor <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Seger </PERSON> refused to respond directly to reporters' questions today over whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had indeed loosened monetary policy. However, she said, `` Let me put it this way: I have been opposed to further tightening since late last year.'' Ms. <PERSON> Seger </PERSON>, who has been a frequent dissenter inside the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> arguing for lower interest rates, responded with a terse `` no comment'' when asked whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> should do even more in pushing interest rates lower. She said following a congressional appearance that it still remained to be seen whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s year-long anti-inflation campaign had slowed economic activity so much that the country would topple into a recession. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which has been pressing the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to ease up and keep the economy out of a recession, had nothing but praise for the central bank on Tuesday, with the president's chief economic adviser, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, saying he had `` utmost confidence'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, as usual, made no announcement of any change in policy, but economists who closely watch its activities said they believed the central bank had eased slightly, based on declines this week in the federal funds rate. This rate, which is the interest that banks charge each other to make overnight loans, is considered the best early-warning signal of <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> intentions. The central bank influences the rate through daily decisions about how much money it will make available to the banking system. The federal funds rate had been averaging between 9.75 percent and 9.88 percent, but it dipped to around 9.63 percent on Monday and dropped further to around 9.56 percent on Tuesday. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has eased and we are looking for the federal funds rate to go lower,'' said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a private economic forecasting firm in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> and other analysts said they believe <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy-makers have become convinced that the economy has slowed enough to ease inflationary pressures. Starting in March 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> had pushed short-term interest rates up by 3 percentage points in a campaign to cool off an overheated economy by making credit costlier. <PERSON> Eliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, director of economic research for <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>, predicted that a host of business and consumer loan rates will head lower in the months ahead as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> loosens credit further in an effort to keep the economy out of a recession. On Monday, major banks announced that they were cutting their prime lending rate by one-half percentage point to 11 percent, the first reduction in this benchmark lending rate in more than a year. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said he looks for the prime rate to fall to 9.5 percent over the next three to six months. Other economists predicted that mortgage rates are headed lower. Fixed-rate mortgages have already fallen to a national average of 10.48 percent last week, down from close to 11 percent at the beginning of May. <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, chairman of the president's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, refused to comment specifically on the question of whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is now pursuing a credit-easing approach. During an appearance Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> did say that the administration has a `` great deal of confidence'' that the central bank will steer a prudent course between fighting inflation and guarding against a recession. Earlier in the year, both the president and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> had criticized the central bank for being overly concerned about inflation at the risk of harming economic growth. <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> said Tuesday that it made sense for the central bank to err on the side of fighting inflation in January and February when inflationary pressures were higher. But he said current signals show that the economy is slowing to a more sustainable pace with inflation abating. Analysts said the May unemployment report, released last Friday, probably provided the final bit of evidence the central bank needed to decide that it could begin loosening its credit grip. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent, but it was accompanied by the weakest advance in job growth in three years. There were published reports last week that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making Open Market Committee, composed of the seven <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> governors in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and five of the 12 regional <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> bank presidents, was split on the question of lowering interest rates and unable to come to a policy decision during two telephone conference calls Former <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> governor <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> may have held another telephone conference call in recent days and decided to take a cautious first step toward easing. But he said financial markets would be wrong to expect any quick and dramatic moves to ease credit, such as a cut in the discount rate, the interest the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> charges to loan money to financial institutions. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will be cautious because we are not entirely certain that our inflation problem is behind us,'' <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers today reached a tentative agreement to raise their production a modest amount to keep prices strong in the coming months. The ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries held a flurry of meetings to try to wrap up an agreement. Venezuelan Oil Minister <PERSON> Celestino </PERSON> <PERSON> Armas </PERSON>, asked if a deal had been struck, replid, `` Yes, of course.'' <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> said the new production ceiling would be 19.5 million barrels a day. The current cap stands at 18.5 million barrels for the first six months of the year. But the cartel, according to analysts, has been producing above that level in recent months. As a result, analysts say an increase of about a million barrels in the supply cap should keep crude prices _ and consumers' gasoline prices _ steady. Further details of the accord were not immediately available. It was unclear whether the agreement would span six months or be for a shorter period of time. It also was not immediately known how the ministers had dealt with <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s demand for a higher production share. The ministers opened their mid-year conference on Monday, then broke up to bargain privately. The talks stalled Tuesday largely due to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s demand for a much larger share of any increase in cartel production in the last half of the year. Other members, including influential <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, want the increase shared proportionately among all the members. The ministers also appeared to have settled on retaining their benchmark price of $ 18 a barrel. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> had recommended getting rid of the target price. The cartel late last year agreed on its supply ceiling of 18.5 million barrels a day for the January-June period, well under output levels at that time. Cutbacks earlier in the year helped drive prices beyond the cartel's $ 18 benchmark. Prices have eased a bit recently as <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has turned up its production. But the price of a basket of crudes monitored by the cartel was still more than 40 percent above the level of late November. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the contract for July delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, has been trading at more than $ 20 a 42-gallon barrel. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, reported that the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations lifted their crude production by 500,000 barrels a day in May to 21 million barrels, the highest so far this year. The agency's Monthly Oil Market Report predicted demand for the cartel's oil would rise in the second half of the year to about 20.85 million barrels a day. The agency previously estimated demand for the period at 20.4 million barrels a day.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

 Stock prices rallied to close higher Wednesday inspired by gains on Wall Street and news of two big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> takeover bids. The gains came against the background of a modest boost in sterling, which helped to erase some of the lingering nervousness from the pound's plunge last week. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index gained for the second straight day after five days of losses prompted mainly by fears that sterling's weakness would force another rise in British interest rates. The 100-share index closed 10.5 points, or 0.5 percent, higher at 2,117.9, near the peak of 2,118.1 moments before the close. The market's low was 2,103.9 at midmorning. Volume was 481.0 million shares, up from 445.8 million shares a day earlier. News of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> takeover bids bolstered stocks in the telecommunications and publishing sectors of the British market. <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> launched a $ 10.7 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 5.85 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Lin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> shares were able to advance across a broader front in the afternoon as Wall Street posted some early gains

 The Rancho Seco nuclear plant began shutting down today after voters for the first time in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history decided to close a working reactor. With all precincts reporting, there were 111,867 votes, or 53.4 percent, against a measure that would have kept the plant operating, and 97,460, or 46.6 percent, in favor. About 40 percent of registered voters turned out. Tuesday's vote was not binding on the <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the 15-year-old plant, but a majority of its elected board members had promised to abide by the will of the people. `` The plant is in the process of being shut down today,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, a Rancho Seco spokesman. <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> said the mood is `` pretty somber'' at <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION>, where the jobs of many of the 1,500 to 2,000 employees and contractors are in jeopardy. How many of those workers will be laid off is uncertain, <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> SMUD </ORGANIZATION> General Manager <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> said he would put the plant into `` hot shutdown,'' in which the reactor is operable but producing no electricity. <ORGANIZATION> SMUD </ORGANIZATION> will then confer with the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on putting the reactor in cold shutdown and beginning the decommissioning, he said. He said he had already informed the <ORGANIZATION> SMUD </ORGANIZATION> directors of his plan to shut down the plant and would not seek their approval. He lamented the vote and said decommissioning and dismantling could cost more than $ 210 million. Public Citizen, a group formed in 1971 by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, said in a statement that the vote `` marks the beginning of the end for nuclear power in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s love affair with the atom is over,'' it said. Meanwhile in Fremont, a city of 165,000 on the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, a child-care tax measure that was touted as the first of its kind in the nation was trounced at the polls. Measure B, which would have taxed residents and businesses to pay for citywide child care, was supported by many working parents, feminists and business leaders but opposed by activists who targeted senior citizens, older families and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> groups. With all precincts reporting, there were 3,671 votes in favor and 12,697 against. The measure needed a two-thirds majority to pass. Voters in the utility district that includes most of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Placer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> gave <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> a reprieve in June 1988 but put it on probation until Tuesday's vote. Critics claimed the plant 25 miles from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s capital is unsafe and has a poor operating record. They also expressed anger at rising utility bills and pointed to a $ 400 million repair bill after a 1985 overcooling accident that caused a two-year outage. But supporters said the 913-megawatt plant's bad days were over thanks to an overhaul and hiring of new managers. The expense of decommissioning Rancho Seco, together with the higher cost of buying electricity from outside sources, is expected to boost utility bills, but estimates vary widely as to how much. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> predicted an initial increase of 7.5 percent in 1990. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellinger </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the the campaign to keep the plant open, called the vote `` a big mistake.'' `` It was based on the historical performance of <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> and frustration with <ORGANIZATION> SMUD </ORGANIZATION>, without considering the ramifications of shutting the plant that supplies half the power of the community,'' she said. The vote Tuesday marked the first time in the nation that voters chose to shut down an operating nuclear power plant, according to <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Nuclear opponents have won elections preventing new nuclear plants from being built in some states. The nuclear industry, fearful that a closure vote could strengthen nuclear opponents, raised $ 580,000 for the campaign to keep <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> open. Opponents, including the Campaign <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> environmental group formed by <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> and his estranged wife, actress <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, raised $ 111,000, according to the latest campaign reports.

<HEAD>Economist Says 1988 Inflation Was 8-9 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet inflation was 8 percent to 9 percent last year, about double previous government estimates, a top economist said Wednesday. <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON>, an economic adviser to President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said a 4 percent to 5 percent increase in official prices combined with another 4 percent rise caused by excess money consumers ca n't spend due to shortages. Deputy Finance Minister <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Senchagov </PERSON> termed <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON>'s estimate too high He said the official estimate for 1988 price increases was 2.7 percent to 2.8 percent, not 4 percent to 5 percent. The two Soviet economists spoke at a conference `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the 1990s'' sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s Economicheskaya Gazeta and the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. They said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is hampered by lack of proper statistics to determine the actual rate of inflation. Soviet officials denied for years that inflation existed, but under the influence of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms have acknowledged inflation and begun to talk about how to combat it. Last October, deputy statistics director <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Belov </PERSON> said wages rose 6.7 percent in the first nine months of 1988, but real income rose only 3.5 percent. But he refused to term the difference a rate of inflation. <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON> said Soviet economic reformers were hampered when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took power in 1985 by a lack of understanding of the severity of problems. Economic managers made the situation worse by boosting spending on housing, education and health but implementing no cuts, he said. <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON> said that aggravated a budget deficit, officially set at 35 billion rubles, or $ 56 billion, this year. But economists said including money the government borrows from its savings, the deficit is more than 100 billion rubles, or $ 160 billion. <PERSON> Senchagov </PERSON> said the Soviet government plans to attack the deficit by slashing construction expenditures and relying on a drive for efficiency for added production. Plans for 80 billion rubles, or $ 140 billion, in capital investments will be halved, and 390 new construction projects will be eliminated, he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> already has announced a 14 percent defense budget cut. But <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who also spoke at the conference, said he saw `` every prospect that the deficit will increase.'' He called for the government to stop a flood of ill-considered economic decrees. `` They've come out quickly, they've been poorly coordinated, in some cases fighting with each other,'' he said. `` That's basically because the reform has gone half-way.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrialist <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, who began his business career with a deal with Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> to supply grain in 1921, told Western businessmen that flexibility would pay off in dealings with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Above all, you've got to have patience,'' the 91-year-old <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> said. `` I think it's worth it because they have a huge population ... and they need everything.''

 Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as traders continued to cast a wary eye on events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Wheat prices were pushed lower by heavy professional and commission house selling because of civil unrest in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> cities. There is some doubt among traders that the 1.85 million metric tons of wheat sold to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which was announced earlier this week, will be shipped or paid for, said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Although the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says there has been no disruption of business in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, it is a situation that can change day by day,'' <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> said. Added pressure was placed on wheat prices by forecasts for drier weather in winter crop areas, which is expected to allow farmers to move ahead with the harvest. Corn prices were down despite the announcement Tuesday of the sale of 300,000 metric tons of corn to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The forecasts for drier weather is expected to promote soybean planting in eastern crop areas, while wetter weather in other areas is expected to spur growth, forcing down soybean prices, analysts said. At the close, wheat was 1 -LCB- cents to 6 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.82 a bushel; corn was 1 -RCB- cents to 4 \ cents lower with July at $ 2.57 a bushel; oats were unchanged with July at $ 1.62 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 \ cent lower to 1 cent higher with July at $ 7.11

 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and its commercial bank creditors agreed Wednesday to reconvene debt-reduction talks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Friday. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s undersecretary of finance, <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurria </PERSON>, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, co-chairman of a bank-negotiating committee, said in a statement that a two-hour meeting in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> `` set the stage for rapid progress in the negotiations with the commercial banks.''

 Stock prices pushed ahead today in an atmosphere of excitement stirred up by two takeover bids in the communications industry. The market got an overnight stimulus from the news that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> was making a $ 175-a-share cash tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has been planning to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>. And traders scrambled after cellular telephone stocks following word that <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> made a $ 120-a-share offer for <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>. Those developments prompted speculative buying of other communications stocks. Analysts said the overall market also continued to benefit from evidence that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might have begun to relax its credit policy by permitting a modest decline in the interest rate on federal funds, overnight loans between banks.

 Black Flag admakers will still the sounding of taps when ants and roaches die at the end of one of its insect spray commercials. Viewer complaints about a few notes of the bugle call sounded at military funerals have prompted the company to alter the ad, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, maker of Black Flag insecticides, said Wednesday. Company spokeswoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerling </PERSON> said the notes would be deleted within about two weeks in response to an unspecified number of complaints. `` Taps is a symbol,'' said Korean War veteran <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Temple </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bryn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mawr </LOCATION>, who called the company Wednesday to complain. `` It represents the finality of someone's incredible sacrifice. `` To trivialize it by playing it after blasting a bunch of ants and roaches away is terrible,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Emerling </PERSON> would n't say who prepared the commercial or how many complaints it drew. `` It was not a large response, but when we heard from a couple of people we took another look at it,'' she said. American Home Products usually examines ad content before airing them to ensure they wo n't offend viewers, Ms. <PERSON> Emerling </PERSON> said. `` We really try to be quite careful, but every now and then naturally judgments differ,'' she said. Temple has been behind drives to build a national Korean War memorial and to have a 1986 <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> film altered to reflect that Army troops, not Marines, fought the monthlong battle at <LOCATION> Heartbreak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, one of the bloodiest in the Korean War. `` I lost an awful lot of buddies during that time I was in combat,'' he said. `` I know what taps means to the people who lost friends and relatives.'' Temple said a woman who answered the telephone at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> told him the company had received several other complaints about the Black Flag ad.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With its engines spitting fire and its pencil-thin nose outlined against gray skies, the sleek <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spy plane set down here Wednesday for its debut at the world's most famous air show. The SR-71 reconnaissance jet has never been displayed outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but it will be a featured attraction at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Air Show, where it will stand beside flying machines from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other nations. More than 365,000 people are expected to attend. The air show, which is to be opened Thursday by President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, will include a celebration of the 20th anniversary of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s walk on the moon. The show, held every two years, is to the air industry what the <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION> film festival is to movies: a glitzy gathering where products are promoted, aviation stars strut before reporters, deals are announced and others are made. More than 1,000 exhibitors from 34 countries will be at the show this year, and 140,000 industry professionals are expected. They cut deals under the roar of aircraft flying nonstop demonstrations overhead. Even before the show officially opened, the rainy skies over <ORGANIZATION> Pari </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourget </PERSON> airfield were filled with jets performing feats that awed even jaded professionals in the midst of last-minute preparations for the displays. After setting down in the SR-71, known as the Blackbird because of its two vertical stabilizers and sleek profile, the pilot and systems officer climbed out of the aircraft dressed like astronauts. Before a crowd of photographers, they unfurled the blue, white and red French flag. First delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in 1966, the plane was developed by <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as a long-range, advanced strategic reconnaissance aircraft. It is one of the fastest and highest-flying in the skies today. It cruises at altitudes above 80,000 feet and at speeds of about 3,100 feet per second _ more than three times faster than sound. The aircraft carries systems capable of surveying 100,000 square miles in one hour, placing it in direct competition with newer, more sophisticated satellites. The Soviets also gave a glimmer Wednesday of what their planes can do. Their Soukhoi-27 _ being shown alongside two MiG-29 jet fighters and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> space shuttle Buran _ swooped, spun, and flipped high overhead. At one moment, the high-speed plane seemed to stall dead still, pulled its nose straight up, and flipped over on its back. <PERSON> Apollon </PERSON> <PERSON> Systvov </PERSON>, the Soviet Aeronautics Industry Minister, later told a news conference the relaxation of international tensions and more openness in his country made it possible for greater participation by the Soviets at this year's show. `` We want to give you an idea of the level of Soviet technology and the expertise of our pilots,'' he said. `` But we do not deny the commercial aspects and know there is a market for our aircraft.'' The Soviet officials said he expected his country's space shuttle to be the star of the show. He said Buran, which made its first unmanned flight last November, has commercial possibilities as a satellite launcher. However, he said his government will continue launching its satellites with rockets. Buran's next flight is to be in 1991, he said.

 Stock prices gained ground for the second straight session Wednesday in a busy session energized by two takeover bids in the communications industry. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 16.00 to 2,512.32 on top of Tuesday's 15.62-point rise. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 983 up, 538 down and 496 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 213.71 million shares, up from 187.57 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 250.50 million shares. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> soared 44 to 170, after a delayed opening, on word late Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> was making a $ 175-a-share cash tender offer for Time, which has been planning to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>. Paramount shares rose -RCB- to 54 -RCB- and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> gained 1 -RCB- to 53 -LCB-. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> jumped 26 to 129 -LCB- and <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> gained 3 -RCB- to 47 in the over-the-counter market. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> made a $ 120-a-share offer for LIN. Those developments prompted speculative buying of other communications stocks. For example, <ORGANIZATION> Racal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> rose 5 to 81 and <ORGANIZATION> Centel </ORGANIZATION> picked up 4 -LRB- to 53. Regional telephone stocks also were broadly higher. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> gained 1 -RRB- to 51; <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> West 1 to 71; <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> 2 | to 82 |, and <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> 1 to Analysts said the overall market also continued to benefit from evidence that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might have begun to relax its credit policy. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> this week has permitted, if not encouraged, a modest decline in the interest rate on federal funds, overnight loans between banks. Hopes that the central bank has succeeded in its bid to restrain inflation and may now ease credit face a possible test on Friday, when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issues its monthly report on the producer price index. Advance estimates call for the index to post an increase of 0.5 percent or 0.6 percent, up from 0.4 percent in April. <ORGANIZATION> Windmere </ORGANIZATION> dropped 2 -LRB- to 14. The company said its manufacturing and shipping activities in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> have been curtailed by the effects of the political turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Windmere </ORGANIZATION> shares traded as high as 29 earlier this year before worries about the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> started pushing them down. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 23.49 billion, or 0.73 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks gained 1.41 to 182.34. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 2.72 to 373.82, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.71 at 326.95 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market picked up 5.24 to 453.20.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers struck a deal Wednesday night to restrain production in order to keep bolstering oil prices, but crude futures tumbled in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading on indications that some nations would continue cheating. The accord, signed by all 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in the sixth day of sometimes-tense bargaining, lifts <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s official production ceiling to 19.5 million barrels a day in the July-December period from the 18.5 million barrels in effect for January-June. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the July contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate _ the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude _ closed down 79 cents at $ 19.67 a barrel. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is limiting production in an attempt to support a price of $ 18 a 42-gallon barrel in the last half of the year. Analysts say <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has been pumping an estimated 21 million barrels a day in recent weeks, so the producing nations would have to curb output to meet the new supply level. `` Everybody is supposed to rein in production levels,'' said <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>. If they do, analysts say, crude prices and gasoline prices at the pump should hold steady. At their final strategy session, the ministers agreed that a special committee would meet in September to review the oil market. `` If it is found that the demand warrants an increase in the ceiling, then this can be raised to 20 million barrels per day or any other level agreed upon,'' read a statement released by the ministers. Any adjustments would take effect Oct. 1. Under the accord, the 1 million barrel increase in the production ceiling will be distributed proportionately among all members. Talks had stalled Tuesday over <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s demand for a greater share of any increase in the ceiling, and some <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> delegates indicated that nation did not accept its new quota. <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, asked about <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s position, told a news conference, `` <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> signed the resolution.'' But Kuwaiti Oil Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON> later told reporters he had made a reservation to the agreement. He said he would give details on Thursday. A Kuwaiti delegate, who demanded anonymity, said his government does n't feel bound by the quota assigned it under the new accord. Another Kuwaiti delegate, who also sought anonymity, said <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> wrote those reservations in the margin of the agreement signed by the ministers. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has been pumping well over its <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> quota. If it continues doing so, it would add to the world supply and possibly help weaken prices. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> also has persistently produced more than its ceiling. There was no indication whether it intended to adhere to its new target, although a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> delegate said the U.A.E. verbally expressed its reservations in the closed meeting. Prices have risen from near-term lows reached in late 1988, partly due to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> cutbacks earlier in the year and to accidents that temporarily disrupted supplies in key oil-producing regions of the world. The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> exceeded the $ 18 a barrel reference earlier in the year and prices are up more than 40 percent since last November. In its insistence on a greater share of the increase, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> was pitted against influential <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the world's largest crude exporters. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> walked out of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting hand-in-hand with <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> in an apparent attempt to signal their differences were patched up. <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> said several times during the bargaining that he wanted to see prices rising. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, however, is concerned that higher prices will erode the cartel's share of the oil market to non-OPEC countries, analysts say. Higher prices encourage more production and more exploration by producers. The ministers' statement said they intend to talk to independent producing nations `` with a view to soliciting their cooperation in support of market stability.'' Some of those countries agreed earlier in the year to curtail their output some to help bolster prices. Under the agreement, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s new quota will be 4.8 million barrels a day, up from 4.5 million barrels. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will have quotas of 2.8 million barrels a day, up from 2.6 million barrels in the January-June period. Other quotas for the July-December period are: <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, 733,000 barrels per day; <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, 242,000 barrels; <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, 175,000, and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, 1.3 million barrels. Others included <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, 1.1 million barrels; <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, 1.1 million barrels; <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, 1.4 million barrels; <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, 329,000 barrels; <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, 1 million barrels, and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, 1.7 million barrels.

 Petroleum futures prices skidded Wednesday despite <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to restrain crude oil production more than the market had expected. The contract for July delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, dropped 79 cents to $ 19.67 a 42-gallon barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, following Tuesday's decline of 6 cents. The selloff was most severe in the wholesale home heating oil pits. The July contract for No. 2 heating oil settled at 48.71 cents a gallon, a loss of 2.29 cents on the day. Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasoline for July delivery fell 1.60 cents to 63.34 cents a gallon. <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON>, an energy specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>, said the market reacted skeptically to the agreement announced by the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The cartel's ministers, meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, decided to raise <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s production ceiling to 19.5 million barrels a day for the July to December period. The current output cap of 18.5 million barrels daily expires at the end of this month. The agreement retains the cartel's benchmark price of $ 18 a barrel for the last half of the year. But the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers apparently did n't come up with a solution to the problem of members exceeding their self-imposed output quotas. The cartel has been pumping an estimated 21 million barrels a day in recent weeks, energy analysts say. `` The market told <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> today: ` We do n't believe in you ... We do n't believe your numbers','' said <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON>. The market initially displayed some strength when it was announced that the new <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production ceiling was lower than the 20 million to 21 million barrels a day some analysts had anticipated. But doubts about <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to abide by its accord created an opportunity for traders to sell and collect profits. Selling was dominated by large commercial energy brokers, <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> said.

 The dollar drifted in a narrow range in foreign-exchange trading Wednesday and gold gave up part of the big gain made late in the previous session. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 374 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 376.70 an ounce late Tuesday. Gold had jumped about $ 12 an ounce in late trading Tuesday. The dollar held its ground despite a decline in the federal funds rate to 9 -RRB- percent, which confirmed to traders that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was easing credit policy by injecting fresh reserves into the banking system. The federal funds rate, the rate on overnight loans between banks, had hovered at close to 9 -RCB- percent for months. Lower interest rates would tend to discourage global investors from owning dollar-denominated securities, but dealers said interest in the dollar remained healthy. `` It seems like the dollar is still comfortable at this level even if the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> eased by one notch,'' said <PERSON> Eishi </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakabayashi </PERSON>, head of foreign-exchange trading at <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kangyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kakumaru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Traders continued to speculate that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was secretly selling dollars, but there was no confirmation of that, said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, foreign-exchange manager at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $ 1.5815 to buy one pound, compared to $ 1.5665 late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the pound rose to $ 1.5730 from $ 1.5710 on Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.17 yen to a closing 142.80 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 142.45 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar rose to 142.84 yen from 142.67 on Tuesday. Other dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> compared with late Tuesday's rates included: 1.9735 West German marks, unchanged from Tuesday; 1.7100 Swiss francs, up from 1.7095; 1.1975 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2010; 6.6867 French francs, down from 6.7060; and 1,436.2 Italian lire, up from 1,434. Other dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with late Tuesday's rates included: 1.6965 Swiss francs, down from 1.7240; 6.6600 French francs, down from 6.7360; 2.2138 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2370; 1,441.00 Italian lire, down from 1,443.00; 1.1967 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2015.

Now his sights have fallen on another media giant, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ which <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western became after changing its name on Monday _ offered late Tuesday to buy Time for $ 10.7 billion In a recent advertisement announcing its new name, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> described itself as a leader in entertainment and publishing and a global communications company. Time, with holdings like <ORGANIZATION> Time-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, would fit right in with <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster and Prentice Hall, part of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s publishing division, and its <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> units It also would fit with <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' vision of what his company should be. `` We will have unequaled strength in quality magazine and book publishing, as well as in motion picture and television production and distribution, cable systems and cable programming,'' he said about a Time-Paramount combination in a news release. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who did not respond to a request for an interview Wednesday, became chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western in 1983 upon the death of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bluhdorn </PERSON>. The conglomerate then embraced a wide variety of businesses: sugar, zinc, chemicals, energy products, race tracks, <ORGANIZATION> Kayser-Roth </ORGANIZATION> apparel and hosiery, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> bedding and automotive, electronic and construction products. Almost immediately he announced a restructuring plan for the company, saying it had become too unwieldy and could not gain the maximum profits possible from its many assets. Between the fiscal year that began in August 1982 and early 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western disposed of more than 50 operations and reduced its number of major business segments from nine to three: financial services, entertainment and publishing. The company, which once ran a large stock portfolio, also gave up investing in other businesses. The restructuring slashed the company's annual revenue _ which fell from $ 6.42 billion before the restructuring to $ 3.78 billion in the year ended Oct. 31, 1986 _ but boosted profits in the same period, to $ 267.4 million from $ 168.6 million. In its most recent fiscal year, ended Oct. 31, 1988, the company reported revenue of $ 5.1 billion and income of $ 384.7 million. The businesses it kept were prominent and successful. <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, for instance, has had some of the biggest movie hits in recent years: `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Cop,'' `` Crocodile Dundee'' and the `` Star Trek'' and `` Raiders of the Lost Ark'' series. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> announced a further honing of his company. <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> said it would sell <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third-largest consumer finance company, and get out of financial services altogether. It's not surprising <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> would have taken the company down the path to becoming a communications conglomerate. He began working for <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> in 1958 as director of sales and marketing, later moving up to vice president of the company's home office. By all accounts he is an aggressive and determined executive. In 1984 he set out to acquire Prentice-Hall; the bid was initially rejected, but <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> won the publisher, paying $ 710 million. He appears equally adamant about winning Time. His $ 175-per-share offer was nearly 40 percent higher than Time's closing price Tuesday of $ 126 a share. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was undaunted by <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, saying <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> essentially put itself up for sale by agreeing to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>.

 Copper futures prices rose sharply Wednesday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on speculation that labor contract negotiations at major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> copper producers will be accompanied by strikes On other futures markets, precious metals were mixed, grain and soybean prices fell, livestock and meat prices were higher and energy futures declined. Copper rallied on word that officials of <ORGANIZATION> Magma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> expected labor contract talks to be difficult and expected a strike. Copper settled 2.25 cents to 2.45 cents lower with the contract for delivery in June at $ 1.0885 a pound. Supply concerns were fueled by reports that <ORGANIZATION> Bougainville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>'s supply contracts were delayed by the shutdown of its Papua, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> mine, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The mine has been damaged by attacks from native rebel landowners. <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said the rise in copper prices also could be attributed partly to a comeback from a selloff spurred by the turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The nation is a big copper importer and traders reacted to the upheaval there with a big selloff Tuesday due to speculation the troubles would disrupt commerce and industry there. `` The markets are beginning to believe that the liquidation was overdone,'' <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said. Precious metal prices closed mixed on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, following a runup of as much as $ 13 an ounce for gold on Thursday. Silver continued the price rise that began Tuesday as the dollar showed weakness. Gold was $ 2.40 to $ 3.80 lower with June at $ 376.10 a troy ounce; silver was 3.3 cents to 3.6 cents higher with June at $ 5.464 a troy ounce. Energy futures fell sharply in volatile trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s new production agreement. Oil ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, agreed to boost output to 19.5 million barrels a day for the last half of the year, up 1 million barrels a day from the current ceiling. `` The ceiling is not high enough,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, an analyst wtih <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` How many nations will overproduce to get to higher level, the market just does n't know.'' West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 53 cents to 79 cents lower with July at $ 19.67 a barrel; heating oil was 2 cents to 2.29 cents lower with July at 48.71 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.32 to 1.60 cents lower with July at 63.34 cents a gallon. Grain and soybean futures prices were lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. There is some doubt among traders that the 1.85 million metric tons of wheat sold to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which was announced earlier this week, will be shipped or paid for, said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Corn prices were down despite the announcement Tuesday of the sale of 300,000 metric tons of corn to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Forecasts for drier weather are expected to promote soybean planting in eastern crop areas, while wetter weather in other areas is expected to spur growth, forcing down soybean prices, analysts said. Wheat settled 1 -LCB- cents to 6 \ cents lower with July at $ 3.82 a bushel; corn was 1 -RCB- cents to 4 cents lower with July at $ 2.57 \ a bushel; oats were unchanged with July at $ 1.62 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 cent lower to 1 cent higher with July at $ 7.11 a Livestock and meat futures were higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .05 cent to .25 cent higher with June at 68.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .30 cent higher with August at 79.02 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .45 cent higher with June at 48.52 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .45 cent lower to 1.32 cents higher with July at 31.77 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
 An energy company has agreed to pay a reported $ 2.75 million to eight families who discovered in 1987 that their homes sat atop a toxic waste dump, officials said Wednesday. The settlement was announced at a meeting attended by the families, local officials, mediators who helped construct the deal and representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Colonial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which once dumped on the site. Colonial Gas acknowledged its coal-gasification byproducts were dumped decades ago where the families' homes were later built. Railroad debris, leather, hospital bandages, bottles, light bulbs, drums, metal paint cans, ash, paint, dye and rubber shoe scraps were among the waste dumped at the site when it was known as Costa's Dump from the 1920s to'40s. The families reported seeing blue soil and camphor-like odors in 1987 to the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION>. Under the settlement, Colonial Gas will buy the homes, pay damages and finance the continuing cleanup costs at the site near the <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in this city about 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The agreement will provide each family with approximately $ 250,000, the parties said. Colonial Gas reportedly also has agreed to pay $ 750,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> DEQE </ORGANIZATION> for the testing and fencing and cleaning the site. Colonial Gas attorney <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Child </PERSON> the cleanup would not begin for at least a year. He said the houses either will be razed, transported to another location or left on the site during cleanup. As a provision of the agreement, the families will not be allowed to seek further damages for future health problems. In a report, the DEQE found the site `` does not currently pose an immediate threat to the health or welfare of abutters to the property.'' But it said the area was unsafe to live on and `` remedial actions were necessary'' to ensure the protection of the families and future users of the site. The families, whose members complained about health problems including headaches and asthma, were reolcated together to a condominium complex in another town. The mediation took six months.

<TEXT>
 A sewing machine company that closed its <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> plant in 1981 has been ordered to rehire the entire workforce and make up eight years of lost earnings for up to 190 employees, officials said Wednesday. Jubilant workers hailed the decision by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> as vindication of their claim that the company, <ORGANIZATION> Reece </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Waltham </LOCATION>, moved operations to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and overseas to escape a costly union contract. `` Maybe this will show people that unions hang on and defend people, we're not just dues collectors,'' said <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ofria </PERSON>, president of the 2,000-member Local 1596 of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, which represented the Reece employees. It's not clear what how much total back pay might be owed. The <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> must hold a separate hearing to determine that. Labor lawyers said the decision did not chart new legal ground but appeared to mark a shift from the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION>'s decisions under former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, when the board steadily strengthened management rights at the expense of unions. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abate </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reece </PERSON>'s president and chief executive officer, said the company would appeal the order, which could cost it millions of dollars, in court. The exact amount of back pay remains to be determined through a separate <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> hearing. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, an attorney in the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> office, said the hearing wo n't be held until after the company's appeal <PERSON> Reece </PERSON>, a 108-year-old firm that had sales of $ 59.5 million last year, announced in April 1981 it would close the plant, which made industrial machinery for sewing buttonholes and pockets. Approximately 190 workers were laid off, and the operations were transferred to plants in <LOCATION> Gorham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Leiden </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. A three-member <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> panel issued its decision in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on May 31, but it was not received by the parties until this week. By a 2-1 vote, the panel overturned a 1982 decision by an administrative law judge who had found that the company had a contractual right to shut the plant. The <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> interpreted the contract more narrowly, ruling that neither a management-rights clause nor a paragraph covering severance pay eliminated the company's obligation to bargain with the union over the plant's future. `` By refusing to bargain collectively and in good faith with the union ... the company has engaged in unfair labor practices,'' <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> and board member <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Cracraft </PERSON> wrote. The <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> ordered <PERSON> Reece </PERSON> to make up any difference between what the workers have earned over the past eight years and what they would have earned at the plant. Workers at the Reece plant earned an average of more than $ 9 an hour, and many who were paid at piece rates made more than $ 14 an hour. The company also was required to offer the <LOCATION> Waltham </LOCATION> employees immediate reinstatement to their former jobs, and if those jobs no longer exist, to equivalent positions at the company's other plants. The board said the company would have to pay the workers' moving costs and, if necessary, make jobs for them by dismissing employees hired after the plant closing. The <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> did not explain why it took nearly seven years to decide the case. However, lawyers said the board has been struggling with a significant backlog, and delays of three years or longer are common. The dissenting board member, <PERSON> Wilford </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON>, argued the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> had waived its right to bargain over the plant's future by agreeing to put the management-rights and severance pay clauses in the contract. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> labor lawyer, called the decision `` a good precedent from a union perspective.'' `` It sounds like this kind of a decision _ in which the board is not willing to buy into a waiver-by-contract argument _ is shifting away from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years, when they found waivers in everything,'' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday it would buy Ohio-based <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which the retailing giant had said it wanted to unload. The price was undisclosed. `` We do n't anticipate it being a significant loss or gain for us,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Muir </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> at the retailer's <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> headquarters. The casualty insurance subsidiary, headquartered in <LOCATION> Westerville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, lost $ 7 million on premiums of $ 168 million last year, about 80 percent of it in auto insurance, <PERSON> Muir </PERSON> said. It had about 350,000 policies in force. Metropolitan Property and Casualty, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, earned $ 40 million on premium income of $ 543 million last year. It had 1.1 million policies, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostrowski </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> will keep its life insurance subsidiary, <PERSON> Muir </PERSON> said. Unlike rival <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> had been unable to produce a satisfactory package of financial services to sell through its stores, <PERSON> Muir </PERSON> said. `` The direction of our company is to become a department store. We found that people did not choose to make financial decisions at the same time they were shopping for apparel,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Ostrowski </PERSON> said Metropolitan would probably keep <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>'s over-the-counter insurance sales force in place for up to 18 months after the expected closing of the sale later this summer, then fold those operations into <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION>'s existing sales force of agents, direct-marketing specialists and <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> 21 real estate agents Less certain was the future of 770 employees at <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in suburban <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> Metropolitan would keep a service center there, but staffing levels had not been decided, Ms. <PERSON> Ostrowski </PERSON> said. Metropolitan, which writes most of its business in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, wants to expand to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Ostrowski </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> wrote nearly half its premiums in 1987 in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with other significant amounts in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> A.M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an industry rating service. Best gave <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>'s insurance operations a B-plus rating last year, which one expert said is generally the lowest rating accepted by insurance brokers. Metropolitan improved from B-plus to A-minus.

<HEAD>Third World Debt Dropped $12.4 Billion in 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Debts of the Third World to commercial banks dropped by $ 12.4 billion last year, partly because banks used the money to buy local assets, according to new figures from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. The fund did not give totals in its monthly <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> Memorandum, distributed this week, or the debts of individual countries. It classes 130 countries in the Third World as `` developing.'' According to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, its sister organization, Third World debt now comes to $ 1.3 trillion. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>, the fund's managing director, said banks hold about 60 percent of it Most of the rest is owed to governments and intergovernment bodies such as the fund itself. Both organizations, owned by the same 151 governments, have pledged to help reduce the debt further, as urged by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. They are pressing private banks to go along by forgiving some of the debt in return for assurances that interest will be paid promptly on what is left. There was a drop of $ 17.3 billion in the amount owed by the 15 countries singled out as specially troubled by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> when he was secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> calculates that they owe about $ 520 billion. They include <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, where price rises linked to debt have brought bloody rioting recently. According to the fund, the reduction in the debt owed to the banks is not due to repayments but to other operations. The banks disposed of $ 8.7 billion worth by using what the fund calls official conversions. These include conversion of the debt from dollars or other hard currency into the money of the debtor country, and then buying shares of stock in local industry. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> has taken the lead in these `` debt-equity swaps.'' In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and other countries the swaps have been criticized as contributing both to inflation and to the sale of too many important assets to foreigners. The banks also sold off at a discount debts with a face value of $ 8 billion. Some Third World debt brings as little as 10 cents on the dollar in the market. After a sale, the debtor country still owes the full face value to the new purchaser, but nothing to the bank. In addition to the 15, more than 100 other Third World countries are classified by the fund as `` developing.'' In 1987, the debts of all of them to the banks increased by $ 18.7 billion. Debtor countries complain mostly about the burden of interest payments. <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> reported last week that debtors fell another $ 11 billion behind on their payments in 1988. These are largely interest payments, since few debtors have paid back much principal since 1982.

 <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it had filed a lawsuit opposing the postponement of <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting, where it plans to wage a proxy battle for control of the company. The suit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, seeks to compel the Natick-based computer maker to hold the meeting June 14, as previously scheduled. Prime announced Tuesday that it would delay the meeting until July 26 to give its stockholders time to consider MAI's recent reduction in its hostile tender offer, from $ 20 a share in cash to approximately $ 19 a share in a mixture of cash and securities. MAI is a <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, Calif.-based computer company controlled by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON>. It has been pursuing Prime, a maker of minicomputers and computer-aided design equipment, since November. On June 1, <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> cut its bid to $ 19.50 in cash for about 75 percent of the shares on a fully diluted basis, plus securities with a face value of $ 21 per share for the remaining 25 percent of Prime's stock. Since the securities are likely to trade at less than face value, many analysts have valued the new offer at $ 18 to $ 19 a share. MAI also said Wednesday that Prime has put an additional $ 5 million into a war chest to oppose MAI's hostile takeover bid and defend `` tin'' and `` golden'' parachute arrangements. Prime previously announced charges totaling $ 15.4 million for legal, investment banking and other costs associated with fighting MAI's tender offer. In a filing Monday with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, Prime said its board authorized a $ 5 million letter of credit to cover legal costs for defending its employee protection and executive retention agreements. Those agreements, known generically as tin and golden parachutes, provide payments ranging from a few hundred to many thousands of dollars to soften the landing for ordinary workers and top executives who bail out of the company after a takeover. MAI has claimed the arrangements could cost the company up to $ 170 million and has pledged to fight them in court. MAI charged Wednesday that Prime has `` apparently deliberately chosen not to publicize this new $ 5 million commitment.'' Prime spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavaghan </PERSON> declined to comment directly on MAI's statement. Prime stock closed unchanged at $ 16.50 a share in composite trading Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.
