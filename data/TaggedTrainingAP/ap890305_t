<HEAD>Restructuring of Army Planned In Wake Of Corruption Allegations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The military chief plans a major restructuring of senior echelons of the army in the wake of allegations of widespread corruption and inefficiency, newspapers reported Sunday. Several major newspapers quoted unnamed sources as saying Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> announced the impending changes last Friday during a closed-door session of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s defense committee. The <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Bulletin, The <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION>, quoted de Villa as saying the shakeup would effect regional and division commanders. No date was given for the shakeup, but the papers said it was expected to be announced in a few weeks. The Inquirer quoted the defense committee chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON>, as telling his colleagues that if <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> did not move soon, he himself would open formal investigations into the allegations of corruption. The calls for a shakeup in the senior ranks have increased following a series of embarassing incidents. They include the November escape of Communist rebel commander <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON> from a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> stockade; the takeover of a military headquarters by renegade policemen last January and the recent arrest of several police and military officers on car theft charges in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Last week, <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON> charged that unidentified generals and colonels were receiving thousands of dollars annually from criminal syndicates in return for shielding them from arrest. <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON> also challenged military claims that government forces have gained the upper hand in the 20-year war against the communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Ten senior officers, including army commander Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Mariano </PERSON> <PERSON> Adalem </PERSON>, are scheduled to retire this year. But the newspapers said the shakeup will affect many senior officers not scheduled for retirement.

 <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemens </PERSON> awarded her 13-year-old son a $ 500 check Saturday night for fulfilling a dare to go a year without television. `` I'm just so proud of him,'' she said. `` That a teen-ager could do that is fantastic.'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON>, an eighth-grade student, described himself as a TV fanatic when his parents offered him the challenge of purging the tube from his life for 12 months. `` Bet you ca n't do that,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Lemens </PERSON> said she told him. Her husband, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, upped the ante with a $ 500 reward if he gave up 365 days worth of his favorite cartoons, movies and situation comedies. The time trial ended at 8:39 p.m. Saturday. Mrs. <PERSON> Lemens </PERSON> said the absence of TV allowed her son more time for homework. While it did n't produce an improvement in his grades, she said, he has shown more interest in reading and non-television activities. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> said he plans to spend some of the money on stereo equipment and put the rest in the bank. He said the money was not the chief incentive. `` It was the challenge, not the money,'' he said. `` It helped me to motivate myself and realize that you can do anything you want if you try.'' The Journal of the American Medical Association estimates teen-agers watch an average of 21 hours of television a week. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> said he was above that average before the challenge. While the rest of his family watched television, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> said he would retreat to his room or to other diversions. `` I did my homework and read books, and in the summer I went outside and played,'' he said.

 A federal judge on Saturday doubled the bail of an accused cocaine trafficker who is a key figure in the federal investigation of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>. Chief U.S. District Court Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said new information provided Saturday by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's Office in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> prompted the increase in bail from $ 100,000 set late Friday to $ 200,000. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said authorities had more than tripled their estimates of the amount of cocaine involved in two sales allegedly made last week by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. Earlier, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gow </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> allegedly sold six to seven grams of the drug to agents on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> and would be charged with two counts of distributing cocaine. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> remained jailed in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> on Saturday and was to appear in court there Monday for a bail hearing. The judge said federal prosecutors have 30 days to file charges. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> statement said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was arrested Friday after allegedly attempting to sell agents the cocaine derivative `` crack'' twice last week on St. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. The 48-year-old St. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> resident allegedly sold five `` rocks'' to agents Thursday and another 20 on Friday just prior to his arrest, according to court reports and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> release. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said he had set bail at $ 100,000 over the telephone Friday on the `` bare-bones'' statement that both transactions involved a total 25 pieces of crack. But he said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's Office informed him Saturday the transaction actually involved 20 envelopes containing 85 pieces of crack. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report said that during the alleged buys, which it said were recorded on video and audio tape, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> told agents he could sell them `` pure cocaine'' that could be converted into crack. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was the target of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> police investigation in December when a maid at a local hotel claimed that he offered her drugs in exchange for sex. Two district police officers went to the hotel to try to buy drugs from <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, but the drug buy was called off when the officers realized that <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> was visiting <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> at the time. A federal grand jury is now looking into the circumstances surrounding <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s visit to the hotel. A second investigation involving both <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> focuses on possible fraud in the city's $ 260,000 joint personnel project with the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>.

His speech will be searched for hints of evolving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy on several fronts. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies, under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leadership, are pushing for sharp reductions in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's edge of nearly 2-to-1 in tanks and artillery. Their goal is to force the Soviet-led alliance down to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> levels and then cut about 5 percent to 10 percent on both sides.

<HEAD>Quake Aftershock At Grand Canyon; Quake Reported In Washington State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND CANYON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A moderate earthquake that shook Grand Canyon National Park on Saturday was followed by a moderate aftershock about nine hours later, but neither caused any damage or injury, officials said. Also late Saturday, an earthquake centered 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> was felt over a large area of western <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> aftershock was recorded at a preliminary magnitude of 3.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion at 2:18 a.m., said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey spokeswoman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The epicenter of the quake was near <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, about 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION>, she said. Saturday's temblor at 5:41 p.m. had a preliminary magnitude of 4.0, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, a Geological Survey spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` It was very quick,'' <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON> said of the Saturday quake. `` It probably lasted only five or six seconds. We could hear the glasses rattling in the cupboard, and you could feel the ground rumble and shudder.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, a moderate earthquake that shook the region at 10:42 p.m. was felt as far north as <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON> said. That temblor, with an epicenter in the Olympic Peninsula 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, was recorded with a preliminary magnitude of 4.4 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, she said. No damage or injuries were reported as a result of the quake, she added. The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Each increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a `` major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a `` great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.

 A hit-and-run bus accident touched off a clash between police and people armed with broken bottles and stones, and four people were shot to death and five injured, authorities said Sunday. Police said the riot occurred Friday night when a bus driver trying to escape a traffic policeman ran down and killed a commuter. Youths in the area of central <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> began attacking police and government vehicles, injuring five policemen, one of them critically, police said. Riot police sent to the scene were greeted by rocks and bottles thrown from behind a barracade erected by the rioters, police said. Authorities fired tear gas and pistols to break up the riot. Police said four people died from bullet wounds. Last month a policeman was sentenced to death for killing two men involved in a traffic dispute. That traffic accident caused riots that left eight people dead.

However, the Women's Federation has become increasingly outspoken in recent months. During that time, growing economic competition encouraged by senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> has been used as a reason for firing or not hiring women or denying them scarce university seats. `` Many women workers have been fired as industries form ` high-quality labor groups' or sign contracts with their workers,'' the paper quoted Ms. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> as saying. `` There are economic reasons for this, but it also has to do with attitude.'' The labor groups are one of the recent reform moves, involving reorganizing work forces into more efficient units and firing the unqualified. Official statistics indicate a majority of those fired are women. Ms. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> said one reason for that problem is that factories do n't want to pay maternity leave She was also quoted as saying women's representation in government is `` extremely low,'' with women making up only one-fifth of the 2,976 delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the legislature. According to Ms. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, discrimination often begins at birth and is reflected in a growing gap between boys and girls in officially registered births. Recent figures indicate more than 110 boy babies are registered for every 100 girls. She did not say whether she believed girl babies were not being registered or if they were being aborted or killed after birth. Chinese families traditionally have preferred boys to girls, believing boys are more valuable as farm laborers and as supporters of their parents in old age. The government limits most families to only one child in an effort to limit the country's population. But some local authorities, bowing to popular pressure, allow families to have a second child if the first one is a girl.

 Leaving desk-bound bureaucrats behind, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> has risen high in his government career, a man you can really look up to. He's the guy who changes light bulbs at the top of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument. Every week or so, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> climbs a ladder about 515 feet above ground to install a fresh bulb in the set of eight red airplane warning lights that blink unceasingly at the apex of the popular tourist attraction. Nothing to it, says <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, a 23-year veteran electrician for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. After all, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> works inside the monument, behind 18-inch-thick walls of granite and marble. He perches 15 feet above the observation deck atop an aluminum extension ladder held steady by an assistant. When he demonstrated his lofty job late last week, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> had <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, master <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> electrician for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> region, as his supervisor. Although the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument sways slightly in a stiff wind, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> says the only time he feels queasy is when he climbs outdoor scaffolding with the `` weebles and wobbles'' to change light bulbs above the columns of the Lincoln Memorial. The bulbs that <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> replaces at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument are 500-watt spotlights that cost $ 70 apiece and last about a week or two. They flash on and off continually from four pairs of holes on each side of the pyramid-shaped monument peak. No airplane has ever struck the 555-foot <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument, which occupies airspace that is off-limits to planes landing or taking off at nearby <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. However, seven people have died in suicides or accidental falls down the monument's observation windows or elevator shaft since it was opened to the public on Oct. 9, 1888. Bars were installed in the narrow windows on the 500-foot level after they were used for the last two suicide leaps in 1926. Thick safety glass was installed later. A high metal grill was erected above the guard rail alongside the monument's 897 steps after the last suicide down the shaft occurred in 1949. The inner stairway was closed to the public in 1976, except for escorted tours downs the steps, because of vandalism and growing congestion. An eighth death occurred at the monument in December 1982 when police shot and killed <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, an anti-nuclear demonstrator who held the monument hostage for 10 hours claiming he would blow it up with dynamite. Ironically, no one was killed during the entire 36 years it took to build the monument.

<HEAD>Politburo Report on Agriculture Plays Down Importance of Leasing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviet leadership, preparing for an important meeting on agriculture, has given short shrift to President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign to lease more state-owned farmland to private groups. In last week's two-day Poliburo meeting, the 12-member ruling body referred to leasing as only one of many forms of management it said were necessary to ease chronic Soviet food shortages, Pravda reported Saturday. And in a speech in the Siberian city of <LOCATION> Omsk </LOCATION>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s commission for agriculture, <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, also made only one mention of leasing. His speech was carried Friday by Pravda, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, reputedly a conservative force on the Politburo, opted instead for more traditional formulas calling for increased investment to better life in villages and to modernize farm machinery and technology. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in October said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership had decided to extend `` to the whole of agriculture'' an experiment that leased collective farmland to small groups and families, who would choose their crops and keep most of the profits. Farmers, he said in a speech, must again become `` complete masters'' of the land. With the exception of small garden plots tilled by individual citizens, all farmland is state-owned in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Since the bloody drive launched by dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in 1929 to eliminate the independent peasantry, the mainstays of the Soviet agricultural system have been the `` kolkhozes,'' or collective farms, and the `` sovkhozes,'' or state-owned farms. A leasing system runs counter to Marxist-Leninist theory, which holds that a socialist form of ownership, such as the collective farms, is a higher and more efficient form of organization than private farming. Any changes would threaten the entrenched bureaucracy that runs the collective and state-owned farms and the sprawling superministry of agriculture. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the son of a Russian peasant, has not called for the dismantlement of collective or state farms, which have been run for decades like factories, with orders from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on what and when to plant handed down to the wage earners who work the fields. But he said in October the practice of paying them `` unearned money'' had to stop. In the past 20 years, he said, capital investment in the agriculture sector rose 140 percent, but production increased only 41 percent. In contrast, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, dairy farms run on the leasing system produce more milk per cow than ordinary farms. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> acknowledged in January that the leasing campaign ran into opposition from bureaucrats and collective farmers, who view those who enroll in it as latter-day descendants of the `` kulaks,'' or rich peasants. `` Leasing is proceeding with difficulty, and thus many people, the innovators, are being called kulaks and <ORGANIZATION> Rockefellers </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` Many people, especially the lazy, do n't like the fact that leasing is destroying the ... habits of the years of stagnation, when you could get a good salary no matter how you worked.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said a law was being drafted to prepare the interests of farmers who entered into long-term leases. The Politburo, preparing for a meeting of the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on agriculture later this month, said it supported the creation of `` multiple forms of ownership and types of management _ of kolkhozes, sovkhozes, agro-industrial amalgamations, processing enterprises, leasees, members of cooperatives, leasing collectives, farmsteads, personal farmplots of citizens,'' Pravda said In <LOCATION> Omsk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> used similar language, calling for the `` spread of different organizational forms of production, based on self-accounting, the brigade and lease relations, cooperatives and also the democratization of management on all levels,'' Pravda said. The Politburo report did not say when the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would meet again, but at its last plenum in January, the 300-plus member body announced it would hold a plenary session March 15-16.

<HEAD>Venezuelan Riots Point Up Questionable Blessings of Oil Wealth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The bloody riots in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> this week highlight a question that has puzzled political analysts since the oil price spirals of the 1970s: What did the billions in oil income buy for the poorer exporting countries? The full answer is not yet clear, but a new study by a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> economist concludes that for some countries, including <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, the wealth was wasted. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and its fellow <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members were the chief beneficiaries _ at least temporarily _ of the oil supply disruptions of 1973 and 1979 that pushed prices from less than $ 2 a barrel to nearly $ 40. The immediate losers were the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other oil-importing nations, which suffered a prolonged economic slump. A decade after the last oil price shock that was triggered by the 1979 Iranian revolution, economists and political scientists are still trying to determine what happened to the mountains of oil income earned by the exporters. So, too, in a less academic way, are people in the slums of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, the Venezuelan capital. Riots that began there on Monday claimed at least 200 lives in a crisis triggered by new government austerity measures, including increases in gasoline prices and transit fares. Martial law was imposed on Tuesday. A few analysts have been saying for years that the oil exporters' wealth was squandered and that most members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> may be worse off today than before they began reaping the richest trade returns in history But their judgments lacked a longer perspective on how the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> economies have performed. Now, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelb </PERSON>, in his new book `` Oil Windfalls: Blessing or Curse?'' has provided a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the oil boom fallout. His conclusion: Most of the oil exporting nations are worse off now than before the boom, making the decade of oil windfalls a massive net loss for the whole world. The troubles for the oil exporters have been made much worse, of course, by the steep fall in oil prices since 1986, from $ 30 a barrel to roughly $ 15 a barrel now. During the 1970s, it was widely believed worldwide that prices would keep rising. <PERSON> Gelb </PERSON>, a senior financial economist at the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, focuses on five <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members: <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, plus non-OPEC member <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION>. He says that of these six, only <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> succeeded in using its 1970s oil wealth to strengthen its overall economy, mainly by improving its agricultural sector. <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> probably fared the worst, <PERSON> Gelb </PERSON> says. By the mid-1980s, Nigerians' overall standard of living was lower than before the boom, he concludes. As a measure of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s failures, <PERSON> Gelb </PERSON> writes that in 1972-84, the economy grew at an average annual rate of 2.5 percent despite the largest investment boom in the nation's history. By contrast, in the six years prior to the 1973 oil price spiral, Nigerian economic growth averaged 9.2 percent a year. <PERSON> Gelb </PERSON> adds, however, that despite the massive waste of oil income on such failed projects as steel factories, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> did spend wisely to improve primary education. One of the chief reasons for the economic problems resulting from the oil boom in these six countries, <PERSON> Gelb </PERSON> says, was the speed at which oil wealth grew. In <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, for example, oil export income soared more than fourfold at the start of the boom, from $ 641 million in 1973 to $ 2.64 billion the following year. The governments, which own the national oil monopolies, felt compelled to spend the money rapidly in order to demonstrate to their publics that it was not being hoarded or extorted, <PERSON> Gelb </PERSON> says. This often led to overly risky investments and too little attention to the need for basic economic changes such as tax reform. `` Oil exporters ended the period worse off than they would have been with a far lower, more predictable rate of increase in oil prices or, indeed, with constant real oil prices,'' <PERSON> Gelb </PERSON> writes. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, unlike many of the other oil exporters, was more cautious in spending its oil windfall, perhaps out of respect for the views of <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON>, who helped create <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> in 1960. He once called oil `` the devil's excrement'' and said, `` It brings trouble.'' In the early years after the 1973 price boom, which was triggered by the Arab oil embargo, the Venezuelan government created the Venezuelan Investment Fund to manage the money it saved abroad. By 1978 the nation's accounts with the rest of the world were in balance. Today its foreign debt of $ 33 billion is fourth largest in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In 1979, at the start of the second oil boom, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s private investment began to fall, in part because of what <PERSON> Gelb </PERSON> calls inconsistent government policies. Money began flowing out of the country. Subsidies fell. Unemployment grew. `` The overall picture that emerges is one of a dramatic failure of economic policy under complex yet seemingly exceptionally favorable conditions,'' <PERSON> Gelb </PERSON> writes. `` Nothing appears to have been gained from the windfalls ...''

 Many of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' fellow northerners are clamoring for his return from exile and insisting his death abroad could deepen their estrangement from the government of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. `` There's going to be war,'' said <PERSON> Chit </PERSON> <PERSON> Guarin </PERSON>, a 27-year-old medical technician who works near this village named in honor of the favorite son of <PERSON> Ilocos </PERSON> <PERSON> Norte </PERSON> province. `` This is his home. Besides, he is very bright, and he gave us a lot.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who was born in the <ORGANIZATION> Ilocos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION> town of <LOCATION> Sarrat </LOCATION>, to return from exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, despite claims from his family that the former president may soon die. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 71, has been hospitalized since January with heart and respiratory ailments. Here in <ORGANIZATION> Ilocos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION> and other Ilocano-speaking areas of the north, the former president is still widely viewed as a hero. `` He is a blood brother and a province mate,'' said <PERSON> Pacita </PERSON> <PERSON> Juan </PERSON>, 46, a farmer. `` Many will become rebels -LRB- if <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> dies in exile -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Felicito </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamayo </PERSON>, mayor of the town of <LOCATION> Marcos </LOCATION>, which includes <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> village. Their views highlight the political estrangement many of the 6 million Ilocanos, the third-largest of more than 80 language groups in the country, feel toward Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Government officials in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, 240 miles to the south, say most Filipinos agree with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s stand toward <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, which she says is based on national security. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has lived in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since he was overthrown in a popular uprising that swept Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power three years ago. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and other parts of this island nation, people generally express contempt for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Many in this region, however, believe <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> won the fraud-tainted 1986 election against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, which was held about two weeks before the uprising. In <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON>, which has about 400 residents, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> received 10 votes in 1986. Residents said they were stunned by the news in 1986 their leader was gone. `` Old people wept,'' recalled <PERSON> Junel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosqueta </PERSON>, 20. `` They said, ` <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is gone; when will be come back?' All of them went to hear Mass and to pray.'' <PERSON> Melecio </PERSON> <PERSON> Duldulao </PERSON>, a village leader, said <PERSON> Ilocanos </PERSON> had come to believe <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> `` was president-for-life.'' `` I had gotten used to him,'' he said. `` We have lost hope that he will still be president now.'' However, most people in this region say they accept the new government while believing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> should be allowed to die here. `` It's not a question of being an Ilocano. It's a question of being a Christian,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonoan </PERSON>, spokesman of the Roman Catholic archdiocese. `` I would prefer that he -LRB- <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> -RRB- be given the chance to come back and die in his country. He is already powerless. I do n't see why many people are so afraid.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Marcos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agro-Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, a state-funded elementary and high school, fourth-grade students were asked if they wanted <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return. `` Yes!'' they shouted in unison. `` <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is not the cheater. <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> is the cheater,'' said 11-year-old <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamayan </PERSON>, referring to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> by her nickname. `` We do n't want what <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> is doing to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. She is trying to picture <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> as a thief,'' said <PERSON> Arnel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, 7. Adults here fondly recall a visit <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> paid to their remote, mountain village during the 1950s when he was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Others recall the public works projects he provided for his home province. `` Before 1963, no vehicles entered our place,'' said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrigado </PERSON>. `` But after that, we had roads and electricity.'' Most people interviewed brushed aside government allegations <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> embezzled billions of dollars during his administration. Others said they did not care because <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> boosted the province's economic development

<HEAD>Eastern: Pilots Crippling Themselves, Airline, By Honoring IAM Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilots, who have virtually shut down the carrier by honoring the picket lines of striking Machinists, are risking not only their careers but the existence of the airline, a company spokesman said Sunday. `` By continuing to stay out, the pilots are committing economic suicide,'' spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said at a late-morning news briefing discussing the effects of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union strike, in its second day Sunday. `` This is a pilot's strike. There should be no mistake about that, and it's a pontentially tragic mistake,'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. `` It places 3,600 pilot careers in jeopardy and it risks the very existance of a great airline,'' he said. `` But maybe, just maybe, it's not too late.'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said that about 150 pilots had crossed the picket lines Saturday, and said there were indications more would work Sunday. Eastern was able to get only 85 of its normal 1,000 Saturday flights into the air because the pilots could n't be matched with available aircraft quickly enough, <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. Eastern expected to fly 125 flights Sunday, and had managed to get 12 up by 10 a.m., he said. Eastern managers thought they had prepared for the stike by hiring non-unionists and slashing the weekend schedule by up to 75 percent, but those plans ripped apart when most pilots and flight attendants honored picket lines. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a spokesman for the pilots union, had said Saturday that `` It's very clear the airline is n't going to fly without us.'' Meanwhile, sympathizers across the country were mobilizing for massive pickets Monday that threatened rush-hour nightmares, especially in the congested <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan area. Strikers planned picketing at commuter railroads and received assurances that no rail workers would cross their lines. The walkout that began at 12:01 a.m. Saturday by 8,500 mechanics, bag handlers and ground crews escalated a 17-month union-management battle at the nation's seventh-largest airline, which ordinarily schedules more than 1,000 flights with 100,000 passengers daily. Both sides were deadlocked on $ 150 million in wage concessions that company boss <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> demanded. Talks collapsed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at midnight Friday and no new discussions were planned. The main target of the striker hostility was <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which bought Eastern in 1986. He is widely mistrusted by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers because of what they call his triumphant union-crushing campaign at sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in 1983. Many accuse him of provoking the strike to do the same at Eastern. Battered by years of labor tension and growing competition in the deregulated airline business, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has racked up nearly $ 2.5 billion in debt and claims to be losing more than $ 1 million a day.

 If the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejects <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as defense secretary, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is expected to move quickly to name a replacement, even though it is n't acknowledging the possibility of defeat. `` The president has told his staff and has told the nation that he's not talking about successors, he's talking about getting his nomination confirmed,'' said White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. Still, administration aides and congressional sources say privately that the president is mindful of the odds against winning Tower's confirmation; and that the White House is determined not to be caught off balance. The speculation is that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s would select a candidate who could be confirmed quickly _ either someone now in government or someone who in the recent past had been a Cabinet or sub-Cabinet official. Some Republicans in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have been pressing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to give the job to his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, who is widely respected on both sides of the aisle. In fact, if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was determined to keep Tower as part of his administration, he could do a job swap, giving him Scowcroft's present job _ which does not require <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation and which is not in the military line of command Although Scowcroft's name has been heard most frequently in recent White House speculation, there is no shortage of candidates. Among them: _ Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. A former secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> would sail through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> if nominated. However, a big political minus to Republicans would be the loss of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, since <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> would surely fill the vacancy with a member of his own party. _ Former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON> Now a corporate executive, <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON> was former President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s defense secretary in 1975-77. He is mentioned frequently as a likely contender for the post, but his support of Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in last year's <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primaries could work against him. _ Former Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> He was the senior Republican on the Appropriations defense subcommittee for many years and was highly regarded for his knowledge of the defense budget and for his skill in arguing defense issues. _ <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary The president of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has become a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> workhorse with a string of high-level assignments and would bring a management perspective to the job. He was in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first Cabinet and most recently was co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which tried to tackle the problem of the budget deficit. _ <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Augustine </PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Martin-Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> He reportedly was offered, and turned down, the chance to be deputy defense secretary, but might view the No. 1 spot differently. He has been involved in developing various proposals for defense modernization. However, his lack of previous government service could be a liability. When asked whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has considered alternatives, whether anyone on his staff has considered alternatives, or whether the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> personnel office has done any preliminary work in such a direction, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> is emphatic. `` To my knowledge and under every instruction that I've been given by everybody of any authority, the answer to that no, no, no and no,'' says the presidential spokesman. But analysts and leading Republicans in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> suggest otherwise. `` If there has n't been at least one session in the Oval Office to bat around alternatives to Tower, then they're nuts. They've got to have a contingency plan,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has to come forward with someone very quickly who can be confirmed quickly,'' if Tower loses, <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said, suggesting that additional delays in getting his defense team in place are `` the last thing he wants to do.'' Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, an outspoken Tower defender, said he believed `` several people'' might be considered as backup candidates for Tower, but that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has given no signal it is wavering in its support for Tower. Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, R-Ill., a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who was a top <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign adviser, said she assumes the president's senior staff has given consideration to a successor to Tower even if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not `` Of course, they'll have alternatives ready. That's what staff is for,'' she said in an interview. `` You always plan to the possibility of losing.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was entirely proper in forbidding his staff to talk about possible backup candidates. `` It is not the appropriate time,'' she said.

<HEAD>Congress To Focus On Tower Nomination, Wright Ethics Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The fledgling 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, with no major legislation to consider, will be dominated this week by highly partisan squabbles _ one behind tightly sealed doors and the other in the glare of television. The only significant legislative activity will come in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which will begin writing a bill to raise the $ 3.35 minimum wage to at least $ 4.25 and perhaps as much as $ 4.65 an hour. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration supports an increase to no more than $ 4.25 _ and only then if workers are exempted until they have been on the job for at least six months. With the nation looking on, the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will resume debate Monday on the nomination of former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, a Republican, to be secretary of defense. A final vote is likely this week, and despite President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pleas, no Democrat has announced support for Tower. No Republican has come out against him. On the other side of the Capitol, a 12-member committee evenly divided between the two parties will attempt to wrap up its investigation of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the most powerful Democrat in government. The ethics committee has been looking into <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s behavior for nine months, and has diligently guarded against news leaks of its private discussions. The panel is considering six allegations against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Most of the attention has centered on assertions that he improperly used his office to produce and sell a book on which he made $ 55,000, in part by selling the book to special interests. He also is accused of having lobbied improperly on behalf of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> savings institutions. The speaker says he is confident that he will be vindicated. A finding that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics standards would send the matter to the full House. Regardless of the outcome, Republicans already have vowed that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> will be their chief target in the 1990 elections. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote against Tower would make history. Never before has the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> nominee of a president entering his first term. Tower, an acknowledged expert on military matters, is under fire for what some senators view as a drinking problem and because be sold his advice to the defense industry after leaving government as a senior arms negotiator. Tower, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, served 23 -LCB- years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The depth of his problem became clear when all 11 Democrats on the panel opposed him and only the 9 Republicans voted for him. Another <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nominee, former Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, is likely to have a much easier time. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is expected to vote Thursday to recommend confirmation of <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> to head the federal government's battle against illegal drugs <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who has the warm endorsement of Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del., chairman of the committee, told the panel he plans to target casual drug users as well as drug distributors The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will vote Tuesday on confirming career diplomat <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> to be <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> has faced some criticism because while serving as ambassador to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he received a document from a Central American leader offering $ 1 million worth of military equipment to the rebels fighting the leftist government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The letter, received at a time when the law barred <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the rebels, was delivered directly by <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. Until committees begin churning out legislation, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has little to do except nominations and housekeeping measures. Leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration may begin negotiations late in the week aimed at producing a budget for the 12 months that begin next Oct. 1. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed a $ 1.16 trillion spending plan that he says would reduce the budget deficit below the $ 100 billion maximum allowed by law. Democrats complain that the president's plan leaves to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the tough decisions on which programs to cut to meet that deficit target. Hanging over the budget discussions is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pledge not to raise taxes. Democratic leaders say any workable plan must include some tax increases but they are not about to take the first step unless they are joined by the president.

The private memo was leaked last week to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newsday </LOCATION> and included some pretty blunt criticisms of <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>'s on-air colleagues. <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> especially was blunt about `` Today'' weather forecaster <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> for using time on the No. 1-rated morning show to offer homey birthday greetings and plug charity events. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> said, `` holds the show hostage to his assortment of whims, wishes and bad taste.''

 British rock star Sting, who has said he will lead a campaign to preserve the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> rain forest, says the destruction of the jungle is tied to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s $ 121 billion foreign debt. The Brazilian government claims it must develop the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> to pay off its huge debt. But development equals environmental destruction, critics say. `` The truth is that the world is in debt to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, not the contrary,'' Sting said in an interview published Sunday in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>'s Jornal do Brasil newspaper `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> produce more dollars and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> produces more air. It's a question of how you value things. I personally value air more.'' He said that `` the foreign debt and rain forest destruction are linked'' because the country's debt-induced poverty `` forces people, who live at the margins of existence, to go to the forests out of necessity.'' Sting said he believed the foundation he established to help save the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> `` will be useful in influencing public opinion in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to reduce the paying back of the debt.''

<TEXT>
 The front-runner for next month's mayoral election is a Democrat, his closest pursuer was a Democrat as recently as December, and the No. 3 man in the race was Democratic county chairman just 18 months ago. An out-of-towner might ask what these guys _ <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and former county chairman-turned Republican <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> _ are fighting about? But Chicagoans are n't surprised. `` When you have only one functioning party choosing one candidate, the other guys get blocked, then frustrated, then go off on their own and call themselves something else,'' explains <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Royko </PERSON>, a veteran political observer and columnist for the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a black, ran as a Democrat when he was elected alderman and is now running for mayor as an independent. <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> entered the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary at the last minute as a write-in candidate, and even though he got 80 percent of the white vote in his unsuccessful independent mayoral challenge in 1987, he is regarded as third in the race now. The city's last Republican mayor was <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> `` Big Bill'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, a three-term mayor so brazen about his alliance with gangsters that his portrait hung in the headquarters of the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> gang. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was eased out in 1931 by <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> `` Pushcart Tony'' <PERSON> Cermak </PERSON>, credited with bringing to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> the modern political machine: a coalition of ethnic voters bound by the principle of self-interest _ everybody gets something. What followed was a succession of politicians as diverse as <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s father, the late <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> _ the last of the big-city `` bosses'' who died in 1976 _ and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, a reformer whose 1983 election as the city's first black mayor and whose death just months into his second term in 1987 altered the course of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the old man -LRB- <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> -RRB- were alive, there's a lot about the party he would n't recognize, even if his son winds up at the top of it,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor and author of `` Himself,'' a biography of the elder <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. `` In his day, a Democrat was a Democrat first and whatever else he was came second.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> changed that by winning with little more than a single racial bloc, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. The town is about 40 percent white, 40 percent black and 20 percent Hispanic and other minorities. `` And what you see now, essentially, are three men _ two white and one black _ relying on the same strategy, trying to do essentially the same thing,'' he added. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s 1983 election came after a racially charged campaign. But his ability to govern fairly eased the fears of many whites who opposed him, and he was re-elected in 1987 with significantly less strife. The younger <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> last week became the first white to oust an incumbent black mayor in a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city by defeating <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, who filled in after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s death. But their primary campaign was surprisely free of rancor and appeals to race, considering the racially split voting. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, 46, three-term <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney, received significant support from liberals and an emerging Hispanic bloc, though the lion's share of his support came from many of the same white ethnics who made his father mayor for 21 years. Black voter turnout was depressed, according to some estimates, by as much as 20 percent in wards that had proved crucial to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s victories. Most political observers laid the blame for that at the feet of <LOCATION> Evans </LOCATION>, 45, who waged a long and often-bitter battle with <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> to be recognized among blacks as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s righful heir. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> was elected acting mayor after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s death largely because of the support of white aldermen. `` That split still exists, and that's the reason <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> likely will win April 4,'' said <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, an influential black political activist and radio commentator. `` Many, many <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> supporters are saying that <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and his allies are the reason for <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s loss, and many are saying they will not vote for <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. `` People are saying <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> will split the white vote with <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> ... but I say <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> wo n't have much of an impact. Why should white Democrats cross over and vote for <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>? They've already got their candidate.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleppner </PERSON>, a political science professor and author, put it this way: `` Almost everybody in the city may still think of themselves as Democrats, but now, most of them are black Democrats or white Democrats.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials questioned an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier Sunday whose 11-day disappearance led to speculation he had defected to communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The officials refused to say what may have prompted the absence of Spec. 4 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>, who they say had access to classified information. They said he returned a portable computer that was missing from the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment intelligence office where he worked. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Niguel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, `` returned voluntarily to his unit'' about 5 p.m. Saturday, according to Lt. Col. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauci </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gauci </PERSON> said <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> was in military police custody in <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION>, 65 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> made no statement about where he had been, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Dye </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 5th Corps in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. `` He -LRB- Peri -RRB- is being questioned. He has been given legal counsel,'' <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> said <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> returned to his unit in civilian clothes and appeared to be in good health. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> disappeared Feb. 21 from the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION>. The disappearance baffled military officials, and speculation on his absence ranged from possible foul play to defection to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Some officials speculated he had defected after a military vehicle he signed out was found Feb. 23 near the town of <LOCATION> Obersuhl </LOCATION>, at the East German border. Obersuhl is in a remote rural area 35 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> had an excellent record as a soldier, and they did not rule out foul play or illness as the reason for his absence. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist. He was responsible for operating equipment that detects enemy radar and other signals. He has been stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since March 1988. <PERSON> Gauci </PERSON> said <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>'s relatives in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> had been notified of his return. In March 1987, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Pvt. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, defected with his West German girlfriend to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in November 1987 and was court-martialed as a deserter. He was given a bad conduct discharge after being found guilty of a lesser charge of being absent without leave.

 A suicide pact by four girls who took rat poison so their parents could lavish everything on their brother has shocked Koreans and raised questions about male chauvinism and the plight of the poor. The girls, aged 6 to 13, were found unconscious Feb. 27 after they took the poison. The youngest died immediately, but doctors said the other three would recover. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Soon-mi </PERSON>, the eldest daughter, told police the girls made the suicide pact because they wanted to save their parents money and ensure their 3-year-old brother would have the best education possible. The incident has shocked <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>, who have sent toys, dolls and more than $ 15,000 worth of donations to the hospital where the three surviving girls were taken. A social organization vowed to pay the girls' school expenses through college, and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ok-sook </PERSON>, the wife of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, sent a letter asking the girls `` not to lose hope.'' Newspaper editorials blamed public policies they said do too little for the poor in a nation of growing prosperity. Education in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is free up until the end of the sixth grade, and the oldest daughter was due to enter seventh grade. Educating four daughters would have been a major expense, especially since most Korean women have little hope of finding good jobs in the male-dominated society. `` It's regrettable and shocking that the male-first idea was planted deep inside the minds of such young girls,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kye-kyung </PERSON>, publisher of the weekly Women's News, a leading advocate of women's rights. `` We still live in a society dominated by men, despite our economic success,'' she said, `` This is a typical case that gives us a lesson. It may lead to a movement against prejudice and restrictions on women's rights.'' Opposition politician <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> visited the girls' parents at the hospital and said, `` I am grief-stricken. I feel a great burden as a politician, and I will focus on ways to promote the livelihood of alienated people.'' The girls' father, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-bun </PERSON>, 44, is a factory worker who supports the family on the equivalent of $ 362 a month. Police said the family lived in a small two-room apartment. `` The deprivation of these children forced to resort to suicide contrasts sharply with their affluent peers whose birthdays and graduation from schoool are often celebrated at posh hotels by expensive feasts, `` said an editorial in the <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Herald </LOCATION>. It said the incident `` has turned into a socially and politically explosive issue.'' Financial donations to the family included $ 700 from a grieving father whose daughter was killed recently in a traffic accident and $ 3.60 from a first-grader. The hospital said the family had dozens of hospital visitors, including Cabinet ministers. The <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said a composition written by the eldest daughter, Soon-mi, ought to move citizens to reflect on the tragedy. Soon-mi wrote that when a neighbor visited to collect money for the poor, `` I searched my pocket and found a 500 won coin -LRB- worth 74 cents -RRB-. I was supposed to buy school things. But I put it into the charity pot, hoping that the money would be used for helping the needy.''

 A high school cheerleader was acquitted of murdering her newborn boy by slashing his throat, after she testified that he was not breathing and she tried to give him a tracheotomy to help him breath. `` I'm just glad it's finally over and I can see all my friends again,'' the 15-year-old from the Valders area said after her acquittal Saturday on the most serious charge against her. A <ORGANIZATION> Manitowoc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury deliberated more than four hours before ruling the girl was innocent of the juvenile code murder charge but guilty of trying to conceal the infant's body in a plastic bag. When the verdict was announced, the defendant slumped onto her attorney's shoulder and said `` thank you.'' Judge <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> said the court must decide within 30 days what action to take on the concealment conviction. The state children's code, which keeps the girl's name officially confidential, allows several options, including counseling and community confinement. Until that decision, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> ordered her to remain in a foster home, but he lifted an order that prevented her from having contact with friends. The defendant, a sophomore at <ORGANIZATION> Valders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and a member of its cheerleading squad, said she found testifying at the six-day trial difficult. `` I was nervous, but I actually got a chance to say for myself what happened,'' she told reporters outside the courtroom. The girl testified she gave birth in a basement bathroom Dec. 28 but the infant was not breathing. After trying to revive him with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation which she learned in a class on cardiopulmonary respiration, she attempted a tracheotomy _ an incision in the throat _ to open the infant's windpipe but that also failed She said she then placed the body in a plastic bag and dropped it in the yard of a neighbor. District Attorney <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said in his closing arguments that the physical evidence, including other cut and stab marks on the infant's body, showed the girl really was trying to kill the baby. `` Nice people do bad things; sometimes they do crimes,'' <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said. But defense attorney <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaminski </PERSON> said the prosecution managed to prove only that the girl had a baby. `` Where is the evidence of death after life?'' he asked. `` As horrible as it is, this is not a murder.'' He conceded that `` everything she did was bad news'' but added his client did not intend to kill the boy. He said prosecution testimony had `` glaring ommissions'' and that the entire prosecution was based on `` manipulation and speculation.''

 The state university that has played host to a Communist convention, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> protests and a building takeover by angry minorities is facing student unrest from an unusual corner these days: archconservatives. The right-wingers on the campus that they like to describe as `` so far left it's falling off'' have accused the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> of violating their right of free assembly for stripping them of the privilege of renting meeting rooms because of a brawl with a left-wing group, which lost the same privilege. `` This is a leftist institution,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Maravelias </PERSON>, a 20-year-old sophomore, who said he will file suit unless the 27,000-student school relents. `` This administration does not want to hear the conservative viewpoint.'' Club members brawled with members of the <ORGANIZATION> Spartacus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> Feb. 9 when the Republicans refused to leave a meeting of the Marxist group. One person was injured. The scuffle was just the latest skirmish in the three-year history of confrontations between political extremists at the campus 100 miles west of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Among other incidents: _ The conservative student newspaper, The Minuteman, was the subject of a meeting between students and administrators last month because of disparaging comments about homosexuals. University spokeswoman <PERSON> Stacey </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> said the school is investigating ways to `` distance ourselves'' from the paper, such as banning the use of the university name on the banner. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> was ousted from its campus office in May after a member pounded the wall separating the office from the headquarters of the Lesbian, Bisexual and <PERSON> Gay </PERSON> <PERSON> Alliance </PERSON> and broke a tape player belonging to the homosexual group. _ Another campus group, the Distinguished Visitors Program, which had shared space with the club before its ouster, complained of frequent harassment and griped that a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> member answered its phones, `` Hello, <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>.'' _ <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> members yelled the words to `` God Bless America!'' at demonstrators who tried to stop <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> recruiting at the university in November 1986. Five months later, club members tossed bars of soap at a small crowd that rallied in support of <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and a dozen other activists on trial for charges stemming from the demonstration. The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> president contends that conservatives are a persecuted minority on campus. `` Basically this is not even a liberal campus. It's a socialist one,'' <PERSON> Maravelias </PERSON> said. The strong words of the small group of young conservatives have aroused the ire of many on a campus that is notable for its turmoil. After the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> protests of 1986, the university gained more notoriety in November 1987 with a racial scuffle that injured 10 students and in February 1988 with a week-long building takeover by minority students. A month later the school made headlines with the election of a Communist as co-president of the student body. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON>, a founding member of the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, has become a frequent target of The Minuteman. `` Certainly it's a progressive campus. For that reason, it is a target for far-right groups,'' <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON> said. The conservative group first emerged in early 1986 with The Minuteman, started with a $ 740 contribution from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which also gave a boost to conservative papers at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> universities. The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> now claims about 200 members, although school spokeswoman <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said a cadre of a few leaders and a score of followers runs the club and The Minuteman. More moderate student leaders say the campus is polarized between political extremes, and few in the middle take part or even vote. `` To them, it's a sideshow. It's a calling-all-characters type of deal,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlop </PERSON>, co-president of the school's Northeast Area Government. He pointed out that only about 3,000 of the school's 19,000 undergraduates voted in last year's election.

<TEXT>
 Foreign ministers from 35 countries meet Monday for East-West conventional arms control talks that may bring sweeping reductions in troops and military hardware from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the Urals. During a three-day conference at <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s former <LOCATION> Hofburg </LOCATION> imperial palace, the ministers also will review prospects for a conference to build confidence and security between East and West bloc nations of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The ministers were in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in January to wrap up the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> follow-up Conference on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which agreed on the new arms control talks and landmark human rights provisions for the Soviet bloc. A new man on the scene this time is Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who will meet Tuesday with his Soviet counterpart, <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. They are to use their <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> sojourn to hold bilateral talks both sides hope will lay the groundwork for successful discussions in coming months. Negotiations on reducing conventional troops and arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will be conducted between the 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries and seven members of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. Talks on new confidence and security building measures involve all 35 countries, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and all European countries except self-isolated <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. The talks start Thursday. Western hopes are based on reduced <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> tensions and the successful conclusion of Intermediate Nuclear Forces talks leading to the destruction of the superpowers' intermediate-range nuclear missiles. The Soviets and most of their allies also are showing a willingness to reduce military spending in favor of more and better consumer goods. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in December gave the new talks a boost when he announced a unilateral reduction of half a million Soviet troops in 1989-90, 50,000 of them in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Since then, all <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations except <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> have announced plans to trim their militaries. The arms talks will cover conventional armed forces and armaments and equipment based on land. Naval forces and chemical and nuclear weapons will not be negotiated. The Western alliance is seeking reductions of more than 50 percent from the Soviets and their allies to offset what it says is the Soviet bloc's 2-1 superiority in tanks and artillery, a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> source said in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> this week. In return, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> offers to cut its artillery, tanks and some other mobile weapons by 5 percent to 10 percent in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the source said. `` Since we are convinced that we ... -LRB- are -RRB- pretty much at the minimum of our defense, this means for our military people a significant sacrifice,'' the source told reporters at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> said on Friday the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> wants to eliminate imbalances, especially in offensive weapons, `` to restructure the armed forces of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> so as to give an absolutely defensive character to troops and armaments during cutbacks.'' He also said verification, a chief obstacle to the failed 15-year talks on cutting troops and tanks in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, could be surmounted because of better monitoring abilities and more exchange of information. Under new <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposals to be submitted in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, there should be no more than 40,000 main battle tanks _ 20,000 for each side. Artillery pieces should be kept to 33,000 and armored troop carriers to 55,000 _ equally shared between the two sides. The other talks are a continuation of the 35-nation <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, which in 1986 formally adopted the first East-West security agreement of the decade, an accord designed to reduce the risk of an accidental war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> source said the Western alliance will propose an annual exchange of information concerning military organization, manpower and equipment involving all participants, improved observation and improved access for accredited personnel dealing with military matters and media.

<HEAD>Sees No Reason to Stop Drinking Unless Confirmed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> on Sunday reiterated his pledge to stop drinking if confirmed as secretary of defense, but said he saw no reason to do so otherwise and accused his detractors of `` hypocrisy.'' Tower also drew a distinction between the past `` excessive'' drinking he has admitted to and an alcohol `` abuse'' problem that would disqualify him for sensitive military positions. At any rate, Tower maintained that such judgments are made by a military person's commanding officer and that, in his case, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is his commanding officer. Appearing on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> interview program, Tower also restated his determination not to ask that his nomination be withdrawn _ arguing that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not want him to and that the controversy over his selection has escalated beyond consideration of his own personal qualifications. `` I still have sip of wine now and again,'' Tower responded when asked whether he had stopped drinking since pledging a week ago to do so if confirmed. `` Once confirmed, I will give it up altogether.'' Asked why he did not stop drinking immediately as `` an act of good faith,'' Tower responded: `` Well, why should I? Why should I? ... It is so little that it does n't really matter. One reason I can give it up, and give it up easily, is because it does n't really matter that much.'' A few minutes earlier, Tower had been asked about arguments by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and others that he would fail to qualify for a sensitive military position because of a history of alcohol abuse. `` Does this not disqualify you?'' he was asked. `` No. ... I would be disqualified if you could prove alcohol dependency or chronic alcoholism. ... In the final analysis, it is a decision to be made by the commanding officer that should be based on hard evidence. In my particular instance, the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the commanding officer. `` The fact is I am not alcohol-dependent,'' continued Tower. `` There is no conclusive proof to the effect. As a matter of fact, the weight of proof seems to indicate otherwise.'' `` You've admitted to alcohol abuse yourself,'' the questioner persisted. `` I've admitted to excessive drinking in the 1970s,'' Tower replied. ... `` I've said ` excessive drinking,' not ` alcohol abuse.' ... There's a difference.'' Tower said he had no plans to withdraw his name from nomination and would relish a chance to appear on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor to defend himself, as suggested by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` I think it would be damaging to the president if he withdrew my name or if I withdrew, because it would mean that the president had finally been pressured into pulling down a nominee that he believes to be eminently qualified,'' Tower said. The decision on allowing Tower to appear in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rests with the newly chosen <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> has said he opposed Tower's nomination, but has not ruled on <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s suggestion. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, appearing on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program, `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' vowed `` to fight this to the end.'' `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> is the best suited man in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said so,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` And he has the right to make the nomination because he won the election.'' The Tower nomination has dominated politics in the nation's capital since the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 11-9 against Tower on Feb. 23, splitting on partisan lines, with Democrats in favor and Republicans against Controversy over the nomination threatens to undermine relations between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> at the outset of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. Democrats, led by <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, have said they were troubled by reports of Tower's excessive drinking, extramarital affairs, and his ties to defense and aerospace contractors. One Democrat, Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, said on <ORGANIZATION> CNN-TV </ORGANIZATION> that although many of the accusations against Tower had proved to be untrue, he decided to vote against the nomination because `` it's risky to have someone with his background and the problems he has had in that office. Tower said that the real issue was politics, not his personality. `` Senators are quite capable of changing their minds. I think there is an imminent possibility that minds will be changed as this situation plays out and as the arguments against me appear to be more thin,'' said <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, who served 24 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, including a 1981-84 stint as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Tower discounted the results of a poll released Sunday by the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, that 44 percent thought the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should reject Tower, 35 percent though he should be confirmed, and 21 percent were unsure. The survey, taken of 1,046 adults last Wednesday and Thursday, was based on perceptions before Tower advocates began their counterattack, the nominee argued. The poll had a margin of error of 4 percentage points. `` I think the debate is hurting the Senate ... -LRB- and -RRB- will cast some doubt on the credibility of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> because of the inherent hypocrisy involved in a lot of this,'' Tower said. In an effort to turn the tide, <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> vowed a week ago Sunday to abstain from alcoholic beverages if confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Tower said he had told his second wife, from whom he is now divorced, that he would stop drinking hard liquor. `` I did, for the most part, express my intent to her, and ... since that time, I've been essentially a wine drinker, not a spirits drinker, only occasionally drinking of spirits,'' Tower said, drawing a distinction between distilled alcohol and wine and beer, which have a lower alcoholic content per ounce. `` I had never pledged to give up drinking absolutely,'' said Tower. Moreover, Tower drew a distinction between a promise to a spouse and a public pledge. `` This pledge that I'm taking now, I regard as ... having the same standing as my pledge to defend the Constitution of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Now, if you say that everybody who has broken a marriage vow or a promise to his wife ca n't be trusted to take this oath to defend the Constitution of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, that he would treat that lightly and break it, too, then that's going to narrow considerably the number of people who are qualified to be in public life.''

<TEXT>
 An inmate on a day pass from a state prison beat his ex-wife to death with a shotgun while her neighbors watched, authorities said. She apparently was unaware that he was being temporarily released. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON>, 38, was arrested about two hours after the beating Saturday and charged with murdering his ex-wife, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>, 29, said Cpl. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockhart </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mishawaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON>, who wa serving time in prison for assaulting <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> two years ago, was being held Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jail </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>. Prison officials said <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> was released Saturday on his first pass since being sentenced to an eight-year term in Nov. 1987 for assaulting <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>. The pass limited his travel to the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> area, 40 miles southwest of the Correctional Industrial Complex in <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION> where he was being housed. Authorities said <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> instead traveled 120 miles north to <LOCATION> Mishawaka </LOCATION>, where police received reports Saturday afternoon of a beating at his ex-wife's home. `` There were several witnesses,'' said <PERSON> Lockhart </PERSON>. `` It's kind of the low-rent district, so nobody probably wanted to get involved. ... There's a lot of elderly people.'' When officers arrived, they found <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> lying in a yard. Police said she was bludgeoned to death with the butt of a rifle. `` She was struck several times while standing and several times when she fell,'' <PERSON> Lockhart </PERSON> said. The force of the beating broke the shotgun in half. <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> was seen leaving in a vehicle and was apprehended unarmed about five or 10 miles away, <ORGANIZATION> Lockhart </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, superintendent of the prison complex where <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> was held, and <ORGANIZATION> Mishawaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cpl </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON> said that as far as they knew, <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> was not notified her ex-husband would be released for a day and that such notification was not required. It is required only when a crime victim or other citizen makes a specific request to be notified before a inmate gets out of prison for good, not just on a temporary pass, officials said. <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> was eligible for up to a 48-hour pass. Correction officials granted the shorter pass to gradually expose him to freedom to ensure he could handle it, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. He said he had no idea if there would be any policy changes following the incident. `` Policy is something that's set by the department -LRB- of correction -RRB-, not individual institutions,'' he said. Police Cpl. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Trippel </PERSON> said an autopsy on <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> was planned. He had no information Sunday on when she was married to <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> or whether the couple had children.

 Seventeen Palestinians were reported shot and wounded in clashes with soldiers in the occupied territories Sunday as Moslem fundamentalists declared a week of increased resistance to mark an Islamic holiday. Palestinians erected barricades and burned tires in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, shouting `` God is great! There is no God but one God!'' and pelting Israeli troops with rocks, an Arab reporter said. Youths burned an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flag and a three-foot wooden statue of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier, the reporter said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Hospital officials said 12 Palestinians were shot and wounded in stone-throwing clashes in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp, where the Palestinian rebellion began nearly 15 months ago. All are in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The wounded included two boys from <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, aged 12 and 13, who were shot in the stomach, and a 12-year-old from <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> hit in the shoulder, the doctors said. The army said it was checking the reports. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said a 50-year-old Palestinian was wounded in the leg in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and a 25-year-old from nearby Askar refugee camp was shot in the hand. The army could not confirm the reports but said another Palestinian was shot after he stabbed and lightly wounded an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier in the arm and that two other Arabs were shot and wounded in a clash in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the army maintained the 10th straight day of a curfew, requiring the 120,000 residents to remain in their homes. Troops also raided homes and forced hundreds of people to sit in the street while their homes were searched, an Arab reporter said, adding that some area residents were `` hysterical.'' The curfew followed the Feb. 24 death of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> paratrooper who was killed by a cement block dropped from a rooftop. At least 388 Palestinians and 17 Israelis have been killed in the Palestinian uprising against the 21-year Israeli rule of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The clashes came after the Moslem <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> movement called for strikes to mark <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Israa </PERSON> wal <PERSON> Meraj </PERSON> holiday, which was Sunday. The holiday celebrates the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s journey to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, during which Moslems believe he ascended to heaven from the site marked by the Dome of the Rock in the walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> urged strikes Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, challenging the pro-PLO Unified National Leadership of the Uprising, which called for strikes Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> move, announced in leaflets distributed Sunday, indicated a rift between the groups. While the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> appears ready for accept separate Arab and <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> states to end the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict, Moslem fundamentalists have declared they want an Islamic state made up of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the occupied territories. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports suggested <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> also was upset that <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> reportedly gave the Unites States information on radical Palestinian groups in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Some of these, such as <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, are known to have links with <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, Palestinian reports said In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a government official said <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has proposed talks with Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and indicated a willingness to have <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> or multinational forces in the occupied lands if they became an indpendent Palestinian state. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> made the proposal in a meeting last month in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> with Rep. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Utah </LOCATION>, and that news of the meeting was part of `` routine reports'' on the 3-month-old <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Striking Eastern Pilots Foresee End Of 60-Year-Old Airline</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> McCord </PERSON> has logged more than 1 million miles in the air in 17 years as an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> co-pilot, and now he's walking his first picket line, in sympathy with striking mechanics and ramp service workers. `` At one time, Eastern was it. It had the best people and the brightest future,'' <PERSON> McCord </PERSON> said Saturday night. `` I do n't think I have a future with Eastern anymore. I may have flown my last flight as an Eastern pilot.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> offices in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, pilots say their decision to back the 2-day-old <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union strike could force the carrier into bankruptcy. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s owner, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has predicted a widespread job action by the 3,500 union pilots would drive the airline under. `` We called his bluff,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>. `` He thought he'd get enough pilots to keep a quarter of the flights. Where are those pilots? They're on the picket lines.'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said fewer than 1 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> APLA </ORGANIZATION> members _ 20 or 30 pilots _ decided to fly. He said replacing pilots may be near impossible, since relatively few available pilots are licensed to operate commercial jetliners, and <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> last year won a court order prohibiting <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> from training non-union crews for strike contingencies. `` I do n't want to sound elitist, but in time they can replace the Machinists,'' said <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>. `` It's a far more difficult task to find people to fly the aircraft.'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said he believes other airlines will quickly hire most of <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> members if they lose their jobs at Eastern. There is a nationwide shortage of airline pilots, but some stay with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> because they have built up seniority. The unusual alliance between <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> and the 8,500 Machinists at Eastern was prompted more by pilots' dissatisfaction with management practices and promises than by unity with <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, who traditionally have had strained relations with the pilots' union, said <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>. Pilots did not participate in Eastern strikes in 1958 and 1966. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> and other pilots say their grievances center on management's pressures on flight crews since <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> acquired the 60-year-old airline in 1986. Allegations include allowing planes to fly without making needed repairs or removing captains from flights for deciding to ground a plane deemed unsafe, said <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> walkout was assured when a last-minute contract offered Friday by <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> sought more than $ 64 million in wage concessions from pilots and did not include a job-protection clause in the event of bankruptcy, said <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, who claims <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> members have already given up nearly $ 500 million in salaries and benefits. Currently, an Eastern 727 captain earns about $ 90,000 a year, nearly 30 percent below the industry standard, he said. `` We had to figure out what was in the best interest of the pilots,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said. `` Trying to keep Eastern flying was not the answer.'' `` It breaks my heart to walk the picket lines and see what has become of the airline I once loved,'' said flight engineer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON>, who has worked for the airline for 18 years. `` The second definition of trust is assured hope. Do I have assured hope I will fly again for Eastern? At this point I have to say no.''

 The <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> family had not slept at home for a week. They camped out in the hallway of their housing project, ducking the bullets, as soldiers battled with snipers in the mud and brick homes and rundown apartment complexes in the hills west of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>. `` I want my son back. I do n't agree with what they've done,'' said <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> inside her apartment Saturday, after a week of nationwide unrest that left at least 246 people dead, by government count. Thousands were reported detained. The army knocked on the family's door Friday, while <ORGANIZATION> Hermes </ORGANIZATION>, a 16-year-old high school student, was taking a shower. `` They dragged him away naked. We went to the military bases looking for him. At <ORGANIZATION> Conejo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blanco </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- an army base outside <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> -RRB-, they said he was n't there and even if he was, they would n't let us see him,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, the mother of three. `` All we can do is wait.'' Officials put the number of detentions at 1,000, but news reports have said several thousand were taken into custody. Most of the detained were taken to military installations, officials said. The rioting began Monday and was sparked by increases in bus fares _ part of a government austerity plan. The violence began in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> but spread quickly to other cities. On Tuesday, the government imposed martial law across the country, giving the military the right to detain anyone on sight. It eliminated rights to access to a lawyer or contact with family members. Officials refused to say how long the martial law would go on. `` They're going to be in there for a good long while,'' said <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON>, a member of an intelligence police unit, DISIP. Many arrests came from the winding streets of neighborhoods such as the <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>'s, where chickens and babies run through dirt courtyards past graffiti-covered walls. `` Thank God my other brother, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON>, was n't here. They were just taking anybody they could. They took away good boys from this building,'' said <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, 22, sitting on a bed with her mother. On the wall above them were bullet holes, proof of fierce gun battles between army units posted on a hill above the complex and snipers inside the building. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> and his father, <PERSON> Abdon </PERSON>, work as hospital janitors and were not home when soldiers searched the building Friday, said <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>. She said fighting had quieted down since then, but sporadic firing continued through Saturday. Officials cut off electricity to the building, but Mrs. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said, `` we ca n't leave because if the military comes again and nobody's home, they'll destroy our home.'' `` We've been sleeping in the hall all week,'' she said. She said she did n't know who the snipers were. `` We can see the boys firing out the windows. But who knows where they're getting their weapons?'' she said. Military spokesmen have said snipers were been using pistols and Belgian FAL automatic rifles, which are also used by the army. `` I do n't know how this is going to end,'' <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said. `` I think the government is going to send in an assault. There's going to be a response, and it's going to end in a massacre Because when the army comes in, they do n't have good intentions.''

 <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> spent the first day of their honeymoon hanging around an airport terminal Sunday waiting for their grounded <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight to take off. The <ORGANIZATION> Rodriguezes </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, got married Saturday night and had planned to take a 7:40 a.m. Eastern flight to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. But when they called the airline, they were told to show up for a 12:10 p.m. flight from <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Once at the airport, they were told the flight was grounded because there were no pilots to fly the planes. `` I'm very disappointed and disgusted by the whole ordeal,'' said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. Eastern flights nationwide all but came to a halt Saturday, when 8,500 machinists struck the carrier. With pilots joining the walkout, only about 85 of more than 1,000 flights took off Saturday. Eastern expected to run about 125 flights nationwide Sunday. Outside the Eastern terminal at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION>, several pilots who were among the 40 pickets said no pilots had crossed the picket lines. `` All flights canceled! All flights canceled!'' the strikers shouted. But one Eastern flight made it into the air. Flight 19, bound for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, sat on the runway for three hours with the passengers aboard before it left about 1 p.m., according to <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON>, an Eastern spokesman in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Many passengers were to board a cruise liner in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Margulis </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Newtown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, whose daughter was aboard, said a pilot told her the flight was delayed because the co-pilot had walked off the plane. <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said he did not know if that were the case. Outside the terminal, a picket hoisted a sign reading, `` The mechanics are out here, who's fixing the planes?'' Other passengers said they came to the airport after <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> agents had told them by phone that their flights to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> would leave. <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasilevich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Poughkeepsie </LOCATION>, who arrived at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> with a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> ticket, said: `` I'm so glad I'm not on Eastern.'' But other would-be Eastern passengers were good-humored as they jammed the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> counter. <PERSON> Salomeja </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, who was headed for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said she called Eastern on Saturday night and an agent informed her the airline could not tell her anything. `` You have to go to the airport,'' she quoted the agent as saying. `` What can I do? I went through the war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. There are worse things in life.'' The number of passengers on the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> shuttle to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was double its normal weekend volume, said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriendler </PERSON>. He said the airline expects to use 64 shuttle planes Sunday with a capacity of 153 passengers each. By 11 a.m., <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> agents stopped issuing tickets to travelers who had booked in advance. The Eastern terminal at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> was a ghost town, with about a dozen pickets trudging in the rain and a sign on the door that said: `` To our customers. We deeply regret the disruption in our flight schedule. Our personnel will make every effort to assist you in making alternative arrangements.''

A year ago she was equally as effective in `` The Phantom of the Opera,'' for which she won a supporting actress <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Muenz </PERSON> sings the factory superintendent, <PERSON> Sid </PERSON>. He and Babe run into differences over a proposed 7 -LCB- - cent raise but also fall in love <PERSON> Muenz </PERSON> has sung on Broadway, in `` Chess'' and as <PERSON> Lancelot </PERSON> in `` Camelot,'' but he sounds operatically trained, much stiffer than the way <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Raitt </PERSON> sang <PERSON> Sid </PERSON>.

<HEAD>California Supreme Court To Take Up Insurance Revolt Proposition
103</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE GEISSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The rate-cutting ax that voters dropped on the auto insurance industry four months ago has produced a confusion of government hearings and legal counterattacks by insurers, but no relief for consumers. In fact, millions of Californians have seen their rates go up while voter-approved rate rollbacks remain frozen by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> pending review of legal challenges filed by insurers. This week, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will begin considering whether to unleash Proposition 103. The court is scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday but has 90 days to rule. The measure, if upheld as constitutional, would lower property and auto insurance rates by an immediate 20 percent below November 1987 rates in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. It would require an additional 20 percent cut in auto insurance rates for good drivers next November. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION>, said the industry believes that the court `` ultimately will find that Proposition 103 is unconstitutional and that it will overturn the complete initiative.'' If so, Fountain predicted, lawmakers would launch into a flurry of proposals to establish `` reasonable rates and cost controls,'' with the guidance of the industry. `` We have learned that you can not ignore the voters.'' Insurers' assessment of what will happen if the court upholds the measure has n't changed much since pre-election days, when they predicted many companies would just pull out of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> market, said Fountain. Proposition 103 author <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON> said that if the measure is upheld, the insurance market will remain calm if insurers cooperate. If it is overturned, `` we'll be back on the ballot with ` Son of 103,''' he said. `` We're glad the court is moving toward a decision,'' he said. `` It's extremely important to decide quickly because we have all these insurance companies out there taking advantage of the stay by increasing rates at unconscionable levels.'' Drivers who expected their rates to go down following passage of the measure have had an unwelcome surprise. For example, the largest auto insurer in the state, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION>, said it is raising rates an average 9.6 percent this year because of underwriting losses not entirely offset by investment income. The action has been challenged by the state. In other cases, drivers are just now paying, as their policies come up for renewal, rate increases that went into effect last year. About 70 of some 400 companies selling auto insurance in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> raised rates more than 10 percent in 1988, state officials say. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s insurance war erupted as rates skyrocketed, particularly in the cities. Insurers in part blamed trial attorneys for waging lengthy court battles in an attempt to win big settlements. In turn, attorneys said insurers were just seeking bigger profits. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, torn by the powerful lobbies of the insurers and lawyers, was virtually paralyzed. <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON>, a disciple of consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, led a citizen campaign that placed Proposition 103 on the November ballot. The insurance industry poured more than $ 60 million into the battle against the measure. Though outgunned financially, the Nader-backed measure won a slim victory, with 51 percent of the vote. Consumer advocates in other states hailed the passage of Proposition 103 as an indication that the issue, already simmering in many areas, could come to a boil elsewhere. Reacting to the lawsuits filed by the insurance industry, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> suspended all provisions of Proposition 103, pending its review. Later, it let all provisions but the rate rollbacks go into effect while it considered the measure. Despite the court suspension of Proposition 103 provisions, there has been no cease-fire in the insurance war. State Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> insurance committee, has accused several insurance companies of violating the spirit of the proposition. He joined other lawmakers in introducing bills designed to make insurers live under the spirit of Proposition 103 until all its provisions become effective. After the state <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> challenged a plan to refer new customers to a higher-priced subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION>, which insures 2.8 million drivers in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, announced it would boost its rates instead. The <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has set hearings this month for both <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION>'s earlier policy-switching plan and its subsequent rate-hike proposal. The department has prohibited 11 companies with smaller customer rosters from refusing to renew auto insurance policies after Proposition 103 passed. Insurance Commissioner <PERSON> Roxani </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said the companies violated provisions of Proposition 103 that restrict insurers' authority to refuse to renew auto policies

 A coalition of two dozen consumer advocacy groups, medical associations, insurance companies and trade associations on Sunday outlined an ambitious agenda of safety and health proposals extending to regulation of bunk beds and garage door openers. The Coalition for Consumer Health and Safety said in a report on its yearlong agenda project that injuries were the fourth leading cause of death in 1987, behind heart disease, cancer and strokes, and that when `` products broadly'' such as food, cigarettes and alcohol are considered, `` then they also play a part in nearly all of the 10 leading causes of death in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The Statistical Abstract of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says that accidents in 1983 killed about 92,500 people out of slightly more than 2 million deaths. Insurance companies and their customers must pay many costs of accidents _ the report said drug and alcohol abuse cost auto insurers $ 12 billion a year, life insurers $ 4 billion and health insurers $ 27 billion. The group made recommendations, many of them familiar, in seven areas _ motor vehicles, home products, food, indoor air pollution, cigarettes, alcohol and AIDS. Among them:

<BYLINE>AUTOS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The group called for all states to pass mandatory seat belt laws, stronger auto side impact standards, rear-seat shoulder belts, encouragement of full-width front-seat airbags and the extension of federal auto safety standards to the increasingly popular vans and utility vehicles which currently meet the less stringent truck standards. It said anti-lock brakes should be required on trucks and strongly considered for cars.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>HOME PRODUCTS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 New powers were urged for the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. In specifics, the coalition called for putting amusement parks under jurisdiction of the commission, which now may regulate only traveling carnivals; for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to require development of a cigarette fire safety standard; for development of child-resistant disposable cigarette lighters; for a ban on the sale of fireworks and for extension of requirements for smoke detectors and sprinkler systems. Garage door openers have killed 34 children since 1982, typically by pinning the child to the ground when the child activates the door-closing mechanism and tries to get out of the garage before the door closes, the group said. It urged development of a standard requiring an automatic reversing mechanism that would prevent such accidents. Bunk beds killed 72 children between 1972 and 1987, often by entrapment and strangulation, the coalition said in arguing for a mandatory standard to replace the current, ill-observed voluntary standard.

<BYLINE>INDOOR AIR</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The group called for more research on contaminants and ways to deal with them, including product standards for devices such as heaters and stoves that might contribute to the problem. It said the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> should coordinate activities of all government agencies.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>FOOD</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal and state governments should undertake `` extensive public nutrition education campaigns'' to promote healthy diets and should clarify and strengthen nutrition labeling requirements. Half of what's in the supermarket carries no label information, and `` The problem of incomplete and confusing labeling is compounded for people on restrictive diets such as those suffering from diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol.''
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>CIGARETTES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Governments should restrict smoking in public places, encourage employers to develop non-smoking policies, enforce age restrictions on cigarette purchase and increase education on the evils of smoking, which causes 390,000 deaths a year.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>ALCOHOL</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The group called for label warnings of the risks of drinking, lists of ingredients and calorie content on labels, and, since `` alcohol advertising overwhelms public health efforts,'' more radio and television commercials to spotlight the risks and a prohibition on sports figures in pro-drinking ads.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>AIDS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 As the number of AIDS cases grows, it will strain public resources, and thus it is a consumer issue, the coalition argued. It called for greatly increased educational efforts, particularly those aimed at changing high-risk sexual practices.

<TEXT>
 About 5,000 Ukrainians on Sunday marked the 36th anniversary of dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s death by forming a group to expose his crimes, but they saved much of their energy for what they see as current repression. `` Our aim is to fight against modern Stalinism,'' <PERSON> Villan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochakievsky </PERSON>, a Ukrainian activist freed from imprisonment in a mental hospital last summer, told the crowd. `` Stalinism Lives!'' shouted <PERSON> Volodimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Solopenko </PERSON>. He told the crowd four activists were arrested in this Ukrainian capital 10 days ago for organizing a legal demonstration. One of the four was beaten in jail and sent to a hospital, where he has begun a hunger strike, Solopenko alleged. More than 2,000 people heard speakers express similar sentiments in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in a rally organized by Memorial, the parent group of the one founded Sunday in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> crowd, huddling under a canopy in <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, applauded vigorously when literary critic <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Koryakin </PERSON> linked Politburo member <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> to Stalinism and demanded his resignation. `` Democracy Yes! Stalinism No!'' one banner at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting read. `` For a Society Without Executioners and Victims,'' read another. More than 100 groups nationwide are campaigning for construction of monuments to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims, but they also take up a wide range of issues. The 5,000 people gathered in front of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>'s Republic Stadium formed the new group. The meeting ended with adoption of resolutions calling for a national day of mourning for the victims of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and opening of secret police archives. The group also demanded legalization of the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, rehabilitation and compensation of dissidents and the release of Ukrainian human rights activist <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilchenko </PERSON> from imprisonment in a psychiatric hospital. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who ruled from 1924 until his death on March 5, 1953, has been blamed for the arrests, killings, or other repression of 40 million Soviets. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> resumed a campaign begun by Premier <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> to clear the names of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims and acknowledge the extent of the dictator's crimes. Security agents did not interfere with the four-hour meeting. <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>'s prosecutor, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevchenko </PERSON>, made a reference at the rally to a mass grave at <LOCATION> Bykovnia </LOCATION>, a village outside <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>. Activists say as many as 300,000 bodies were dumped in the mass grave. Three government commissions had blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, who occupied the village from 1941 to 1943, but villagers say the killers were <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s secret police. <PERSON> Shevchenko </PERSON> said investigators had found evidence that people buried at <LOCATION> Bykovnia </LOCATION> disappeared in 1937-38. But he said officials still believe the site may also contain victims of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. Another speaker alleged that sand and bones from another suspected mass grave of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims, at Poltava in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, are being processed into concrete for apartment buildings. The deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Kiev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinyuk </PERSON>, won applause for joining the call to open government archives. But the audience was less receptive when he said the party was a victim of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Martinyuk </PERSON> said 94 of the 120 members of the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s time were `` repressed.'' In answer to questions from the crowd, <PERSON> Shevchenko </PERSON> claimed to have no power to free the four activists arrested 10 days ago, but promised to investigate and protest if the charge _ hooliganism _ proves false. `` We have a Soviet society of laws,'' he said, using a favorite phrase of reformers. When the prosecutor said Ukrainian officials already abide by the law, some crowd members laughed.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said Sunday that Moslems should have ignored `` The Satanic Verses,'' because controversy has brought the novel publicity, but she also said the book should be banned. A radical Palestinian leader, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, vowed every effort to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> `` in defense of relgion, God, and his prophet.'' Iranian media hinted a compromise was possible in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s diplomatic standstill with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> over the book, which some say insults Islam Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, speaking on the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> phone-in show `` It's Your World,'' said, `` I do feel that the fundamentalists have spread <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s blasphemy.'' `` Because what somebody writes -LRB- that -RRB- is not known, who cares about that blasphemy? ... Perhaps it would have been more appropriate to ignore such a book, to condemn it,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> came to power three months ago. She noted that the previous Pakistani government had banned <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book but added, `` I do n't think it has so much -LRB- to do -RRB- with <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> or the book, but I think they just wanted a pretext to create a law and order situation and to create anarchy.'' However, she agreed that the book should be outlawed. Her country is one of at least nine that have banned `` The Satanic Verses.'' `` I to think there are rare exceptions when the state has to intervene ... balancing the freedom of expression and balancing the security and the lives of the citizens,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said of the ban. Demonstrations against the book have killed 19 people in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, a British citizen who was born into a Moslem family in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, has been in hiding since Feb. 14, when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> sentenced him to death. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> said his Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> will make every effort to carry out the death order. Although a staunch Marxist, <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book was `` a new conspiracy ... a desperate attempt to defame <PERSON> God </PERSON> and his prophet.'' <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, a former Syrian army capital, leads about 1,000 fighters based in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and Syrian-controlled provinces in neighboring <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s statement was distributed to Syrian news offices. The <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Times, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main English publication, suggested in an editorial Sunday a `` change'' was possible in the deteriorating relations between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. It referred to statements by British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and her foreign secretary, Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, acknowledging the `` The Satanic Verses'' was insulting to Moslems. `` It may still be possible for a change to occur in view of the new attitude which the British leaders are beginning to adopt, even though slowly and late,'' the newspaper said in an editorial reported by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` Whether the changes in the air from the British side will be enough to satisfy the Iranian government is yet to be seen,'' the paper said. In its own commentary, however, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said the statements from Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> are `` far from meeting the conditions set by the Majlis -LRB- parliament -RRB-.'' `` The withdrawal of all copies of ` The Satanic Verses' and banning of its reprinting by the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government would certainly bring <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> closer to implentation of the Iranian conditions,'' the news service said. The Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> voted Tuesday to break relations with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> unless <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> within a week reversed its decision to withdraw diplomats from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has protested <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death call and demanded it be rescinded.

<HEAD>Last-Minute Calls From Mormon Officials Doom Bill, But Reactions
Mixed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The way state Sen. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornaby </PERSON> tells it, the last-minute call from a <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> official about a pending liquor bill was no more than a mild suggestion that the measure needed further study. But that and similar calls to other state senators at the hectic finale of the 1989 Legislature last month apparently doomed the bill, prompting accusations of illegal interference and forcing the temperance-minded church to defend its right to speak out on what it views as moral issues. The measure, which easily won <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approval and was pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, would have formally legalized a decades-old practice of allowing adult passengers in limousines and charter buses to drink alcoholic beverages. `` The request that I got, was if it hit the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, to take a close look and evaluate what effect it might have,'' said <PERSON> Cornaby </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Image </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limousines </ORGANIZATION>, contends the calls amounted to an unconstitutional mingling of church and state, and illegal contact by unregistered lobbyists. He's threatened lawsuits on both issues. `` Senators are duly elected officials. They are of the people and for the people,'' he said. `` This is a case of ` of the church and for the church.''' That view prompted the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> to defend <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s predominant religion, saying its representatives have a right to express opinions on legislative matters. Cornaby and several other Republicans were called by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> of the church's public communications department. <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> said Friday that church officials had recommended to legislative leaders during a routine pre-session briefing that any measure involving liquor undergo detailed study. The last-minute calls, he said, merely reiterated that position. In an editorial Wednesday, The <ORGANIZATION> Salt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> labeled the calls an inappropriate `` end run'' of the statutory process for influencing legislation. The newspaper said the church already had a registered lobbyist, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> McConkie </PERSON>, and that such contacts were within his province. <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> denied the calls constituted lobbying and said <PERSON> McConkie </PERSON> was ill and unavailable at the time. The <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> lobbyist law holds that anyone who receives contributions or compensation for the `` purpose of attempting to influence the passage or defeat of any legislation'' must register with the state. But Associate Chief Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said last week that <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> were `` technically within the law'' because neither received additional compensation beyond their normal church salaries. It is by no means the first time officials of the Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day Saints, which strongly discourages use of alcohol, tobacco, coffee or tea, have tendered opinions on liquor legislation. Indeed, lawmakers frequently have sought the church's opinion on proposed changes in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s strict drinking laws. This case involved a tradition in which limo and bus operators, especially those running `` gambler specials'' to <LOCATION> Wendover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, have allowed patrons to take along beer or spirits. The practice was halted last summer when the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> attorney general's office decided it violated a law banning open containers in motor vehicles. The measure to legalize the practice was approved by a 53-20 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote after supporters argued that it would keep drunken drivers off the road and that defeat would hurt tourism by bolstering outsiders' beliefs that <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> is an inhospitable place. The bill had the support of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> and Gov. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON>, a Mormon. The measure was never debated because <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, who also was called, would not recognize the sponsor, Sen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunnell </PERSON>. `` This is a bit of a tempest in a teapot, I think,'' said <PERSON> Bunnell </PERSON> later. `` I just think the church could have done a better job of it.''

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> bowed to political and military pressure Sunday and said he is forming a new government in hopes of ending the nearly 6-year-old civil war. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> made the announcement after signing a `` national peace declaration'' with other political leaders that endorses a tentative peace agreement with the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>. At a news conference, <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> also announced the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> had expressed a willingness to join the new government. It had refused to sign the peace declaration. There was no immediate reaction from the rebels, who are mainly Christian and animist and are demanding political and economic reforms from the mainly Moslem government. The military had demanded <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> sign the cease-fire agreement. The armed forces did not say what they would do if <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> did not sign, but <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> had threatened to resign unless the army promised not to overthrow him and union leaders pledged not to strike. The announcment came on the deadline <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> gave for his resignation. Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> quoted <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> as saying he would stay in office because the military and the professional and trade unions had assured him of their support. He said his Cabinet ministers offered him their resignations and that the new broad-based government would be announced `` in the shortest time possible.'' `` The new government will be formed with the aim of establishing the largest amount of unity on the internal front,'' <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said. He also promised a general election but did not say when it would be held. The next scheduled election is in 1992. He said the new government would concentrate on the `` quick support'' of the armed forces, which in recent months have lost several towns to the rebels. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said the armed forces sent him a memo Sunday supporting the constitution and the democratic process. He said `` ongoing contacts'' were under way to organize a meeting `` to resolve the peace issue.'' He did not elaborate. On Saturday night, <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> and 60 political and union leaders, signed a program for the new government and the `` national peace declaration.'' Under the agreement, the new government must endorse a tentative peace plan signed Nov. 16 between the rebels and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the second-largest party after <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Umma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The peace plan calls for an immediate cease-fire and end to the state of emergency, and a conference with all political parties and the rebels to negotiate a new government. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s failure to endorse it prompted the Democratic Unionists to quit the coalition government in December. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> then formed a new government with the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which rejected peace talks because the rebels are mainly Christian and animist. The rebels have fought since 1983 and won several victories in recent months. Last month, they captured <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION>, the second largest garrison in the south.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> pledged Sunday to help <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> recover from its 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and both nations said they would establish closer ties, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s state-run news agencies said. President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> met with Deputy Premier <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiyun </PERSON> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and agreed to increase cooperation, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said that <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader `` The fields of cooperation between our two countries are more than those currently identified, and other fields where we can cooperate must be studied more seriously.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was one of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s major arms-suppliers during the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, when <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> was virtually isolated by the West and faced an arms embargo that forced it to look elsewhere for crucially needed weaponry. <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> was reported as saying: `` We sympathize with the loss of life and property during the war. We will use all our efforts to help you in reconstruction.'' Analysts estimate that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s reconstruction programs would cost $ 300 billion to $ 500 billion. Western companies have been trying to move into the Iranian market. But with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> receding anew into diplomatic isolation after <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s call for killing British writer <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, countries such as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can presumably have a larger chunk of Iranian reconstruction projects. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said: `` In our cooperation with other countries, we prefer to deal with countries for which our nation does not harbor bitter memories.'' He said: `` Our reconstruction will not be limited to those destroyed by the war. We will embark on all programs which where ignored by the previous regime.'' Earlier Sunday, <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> met with Iranian Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. The agency, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> as saying the good Iran-China relations during the Gulf war, would `` certainly'' have a positive influence on the expansion of mutual cooperation. The Chinese official, heading a high-ranking political-economic delegation according to <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, arrived in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Friday, marking the latest of a string of high-level visits to each other's countries by Chinese and Iranian officials in recent months.

<HEAD>Navy Moves To Block Ships From Militia-run Ports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The military chief and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> moved to reduce the power of private armies Sunday by ordering a ban on foreign ships in ports run by militias. Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, the commander of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s fragmented army, said the order is an attempt to restore government authority eroded by 14 years of civil war, said an official statement. The ban takes effect Monday, it said. Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, leader of the rival <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, warned <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s move could trigger new tensions `` because of unilateral decisions taken without prior coordination.'' But <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> did not say whether his Cabinet would seek to counter the general's order. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> reactivated a maritime office, paralyzed since the civil war broke out in 1975, to supervise <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 160-mile-long <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coastline and ordered the navy of four patrol boats to help enforce the ban. Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militias have been running their own ports to get arms and supplies, as well as all other imported goods, for areas under their control. That has robbed the state treasury of an estimated $ 100 million a year in customs levies. The new order follows <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s February crackdown on the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, the Christians' main militia and his government's chief rival in the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> heartland north and northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Police said 82 people were killed and at least 200 wounded in a three-day confrontation between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 predominantly Christian troops and the 6,000-strong militia led by <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has driven the Lebanese Forces out of the so-called Fifth Basin of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s port, which the militia operated, and has taken over inland customs posts, depriving the militia of income worth $ 400,000 a day. He also ordered no taxes be paid to the Lebanese Forces in areas under army control, stripping the militia of another 30 percent of its revenue. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Sunday announcement is aimed at closing down illegal ports run by other <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Moslem militias. The general's forces may be able to enforce the shipping ban in militia ports in the Christian sector, but he probably will have more difficulty doing so in ports held by Moslem militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where his writ does not run. His success against the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> has done much to restore government authority in the Christian sector. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has urged his Moslem rivals to reassert state authority in territory they control and take similar action against Moslem militias. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has had rival Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> governments since Sept. 22, when outgoing President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to head an interim military Cabinet until <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> elected a new president. Moslems refused to accept <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s appointment. They pledged loyalty to <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who served as prime minister in the <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> administration.

<HEAD>Eastern Passengers Run Aground As Strike Sullies Peak Florida Season</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Travelers slept on their luggage in airport lobbies, stood in lines of confusion, argued over transfers and cursed the labor fiasco that left them stranded Sunday on the second day of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike. Would-be passengers learned firsthand the hassle of going places during an airline strike, particularly in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s hometown at the height of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> cruise trade and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s tourist season. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vannua </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, defined the issue, and none too delicately, for passengers at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` I'm not flying this stinking airline again!'' he yelled as he tore up his Eastern frequent-flier card. He and three friends had been waiting three hours to have their tickets validated by Eastern for flights on other carriers. Eastern apologized Sunday for inconveniences suffered by its passengers. `` We are placing the emphasis on protecting the cruise passengers, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> routes and the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> shuttle,'' said company spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>. `` The handling of passengers is below what we would like.'' He admitted the airline has not been able to find lodging for all passengers. `` We've been able to put many in hotels, but it's Grand Prix weekend and the hotels are totally booked,'' he said. This is the height of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s tourist season with the Honda Classic PGA tournament in <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION> and baseball spring training. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, referred to somewhat fondly as <LOCATION> Mondo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, raises chaos to an art form on a normal day. That was compounded Sunday by the strike. Anxious passengers peppered frazzled Eastern employees in Spanish, French, Haitian Creole and English. `` Nobody knows nothing,'' said 33-year-old <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rink </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` There's nobody walking around talking to people to explain things. They need a troubleshooter.'' In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, about 300 cruise ship passengers who had booked <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flights to the mainland were stranded late Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> Munoz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>. Cruise ship tourists frequently end their cruise in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, where they return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by air. `` We managed to get all those passengers out, either on Eastern flights or with other airlines. The last of them left for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on an -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> at 11 p.m.,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Deleo </PERSON>, adding that Sunday the airline `` chartered four planes from <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> for cruise ship passengers.'' At <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> customer service representative, tried to help passengers. `` Everything is crazy,'' she said. `` They're canceling -LRB- flights -RRB- as we go along. Other airlines are working with us. We're going to do the best we can with what we have. ... I need a cocktail.'' For <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, arriving in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on an Eastern flight at 1:30 a.m. Saturday after his original flight was canceled, it meant being stuck at Kennedy International Airport. `` After the strike is over, I'll write a letter of complaint and bill them for my extra expenses.'' While many passengers were cranky, others were understanding. `` I'm a little disappointed, but they've been very helpful. I think the people behind the desk are doing a great job,'' said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, 59, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who was headed to <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> for a relative's funeral. Ms. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> was rescheduled for a flight three hours later on <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s sister carrier, also owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Most airlines are helping Eastern, except for <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said Sunday. `` <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> is not helping at all; <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> takes passengers on standby; <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> takes passengers on standby; <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> has been helping depending on availability, either booking them on or standby; <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> has got the same pattern; <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> have the same policy,'' <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said. `` Continental is taking everything.'' In a designated area of <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, 32-year-old Machinist <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehill </PERSON> handed out informational pamphlets and watched passengers scurrying about. `` I feel sorry for these people,'' he said, but he added, `` Their day of inconvenience is my whole life. I've got a child and wife to support.''

<HEAD>Security Stepped Up In Kosovo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The army called in reinforcements to tighten security in the troubled province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, where a state of emergency has been in effect to quell ethnic tensions, <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> newspapers reported Sunday. The newspapers quoted Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Andrija </PERSON> <PERSON> Silic </PERSON>, commander of the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> military corps, as saying that some military reservists in the area have been activated in the province. Emergency measures, including a ban on mass gatherings and an increase of military and police strength, were introduced in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> on Feb. 27 to prevent clashes between the ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> majority and the Slav minority. The measures came after protests by ethnic Albanians against planned constitutional changes they fear will limit the autonomy of the region which administratively belongs to the republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. Serbian leaders claim tighter control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> is necessary to protect the Slavs in the region who allege constant persecution and harassment by the Albanians majority. Ninety percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s 2 million population is ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON>. The province in southern <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> borders <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. `` Armed force units have been placed in an increased state of combat readiness and part of military reservists have been mobilized'' in the province, <PERSON> Silic </PERSON> was quoted as saying by state media. `` The high state of our combat readiness ... is our great contribution to the stabilization of the situation -LRB- in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> -RRB- and the best barrier against aggressive forces,'' <PERSON> Silic </PERSON> reportedly said. National television Saturday night showed several tanks and armored vehicles on training exercises or on patrol in the province. About 20 leading ethnic Albanian company directors or party officials, including <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> party chief <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>, have been arrested in the province since Thursday in a crackdown on ethnic Albanian dissent. Most of them allegedly belonged to an illegal group that reportedly detailed plans to destabilize the province by strikes and protests and then carry out an armed uprising in which the region would secede from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> in order to join <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> newspapers said Sunday that 250 ethnic Albanian shop owners, who closed their stores last week to protest the planned changes of the constitution, now face fines for violating working hours regulations.

 Here are some developments Sunday in the 2-day-old <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union strike:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>FLIGHTS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Nineteen flights had taken off by 2 p.m. EST. Eastern said it expected to run 125 flights by the end of the day. Along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, hundreds of anxious passengers spent hours in lines in Eastern terminals, hoping to find seats on other airlines or get refunds. Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> called service so far `` a mess'' and apologized to passengers.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PILOTS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Eastern pilots, who virtually shut down <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> by honoring picket lines of the striking <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, risk their careers and `` the very existence'' of the airline, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. `` By continuing to stay out, the pilots are committing economic suicide.'' Bakes urged pilots to return to work. Eastern said the pilots were on strike, but a spokesman for the pilots union said there was no strike. `` We are honoring the picket lines,'' said <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>. And the 41,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reiterated a pledge to begin a slowdown Tuesday that could delay every flight in the country.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PICKETS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Machinists and supporters picketed Eastern terminals. No problems were reported Sunday, but three pickets were arrested Saturday at <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> on charges of picketing in unauthorized areas, officials said Sunday. They were released after a brief court appearance. The Machinists' strike was joined by most <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants and pilots. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke at a rally for about 1,500 strikers and their supporters. He urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene and bring the two sides together.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>NEGOTIATIONS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 None are scheduled. The last talks were Friday; they failed to produce an agreement, and the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union strike began at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>RAILROADS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order against three major rail lines that carry 320,000 commuters daily between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and northern suburbs. Eight other commuter railroads nationwide and <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> had been potential targets of sympathy actions.

 A snake-venom researcher bitten by a deadly viper rested comfortably Sunday while doctors considered whether to treat him with antivenins from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a hospital spokesman said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>, 78, remained in serious but stable condition at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> after being bitten on the left hand Tuesday by a Pakistani pit viper, also known as a saw-scaled viper, said hospital spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Haast </PERSON> is resting very comfortably, eating and chatting with friends,'' <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> said. `` He's just in danger, if you will.'' <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Serpentarium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> at the university's Research Park, has been bitten 148 times by snakes and is immune to the venom of dozens of reptiles. But he had no immunity to the viper's bite and checked himself into the hospital Wednesday. The saw-scaled viper's venom attacks its victim's ability to produce fibrinogen, an element of blood that regulates coagulation. A lack of fibrinogen can cause uncontrolled bleeding. <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> said the level of <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>'s fibrinogen had been improving slightly although it remained `` dangerously low'' Sunday. Doctors were replacing <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>'s fibrinogen with transfusions and it appeared his system had begun to produce it again, <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>'s blood was being analyzed every four hours, and that by late Saturday his fibrogen level was about one-third of normal. On Wednesday, he said, `` for all intents and purposes -LRB- it was -RRB- at zero.'' <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>'s plight prompted an effort by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Studdernt </PERSON>, special assistant to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, to coordinate the acquisition of antivenins from the three nations and expedite shipment to <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> said antivenins from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> had arrived, but he did not know if the one from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had. The antivenin from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was more specifically made to counteract venom from the species of viper that bit <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>, he said. However, he said doctors were `` very leery about giving medication to someone from a source about which we know very little about.'' Antivenins are made from horse serum and can cause negative side effects such as lung and kidney problems, he said. `` We want to emphasize the fact that we're grateful to everyone who went to such great lengths to get the antivenin,'' <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> said. `` The decision on whether to use them or not will be based on Mr. <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>'s condition. Hopefully we wo n't have to use them.'' <PERSON> Haast </PERSON> had been treated earlier with antivenins from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> and from a lab in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> said Saturday he had not been given antivenins for about 24 hours He said doctors also had contacted scientists and physicans in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to discuss treatment. `` It's a special kind of snake, with a special kind of poison, and the immunology is complicated,'' <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> said. `` Our physicians are n't just winging it on their own.'' <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON> said the Iranian government apparently did not interfere with the shipment of the antivenin despite the strained relations between the two nations. Iranian leader <PERSON> Ayatolla </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has often called the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the `` great Satan.'' The Pakistani pit viper is one of 1,000 exotic, poisonous snakes <PERSON> Haast </PERSON> keeps at the laboratory, where their venom is extracted for sale to universities and health organizations for research and the manufacture of antivenins.

<HEAD>Snakes Win Round At Rattlesnake Rodeo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OPP, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Operators of a rattlesnake rodeo, rattled by criticism that they could be driving the Eastern diamondback to extinction, returned their catch to the wild Sunday. Because the 150 snakes were freed at the end of the two-day event, no rattlesnake meat was on sale at Opp's 30th Rattlesnake Rodeo for the thousands of people who attended. The meat had been one of the better drawing cards over the years. In previous years, most of the 150 to 300 snakes that were rounded up were either killed for their meat or sold to researchers or snake exhibitors. `` We've been getting criticism for years from environmentalists, animal rights groups and others about the way we did some things,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartzog </PERSON>, head snake handler for the <ORGANIZATION> Opp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaycees </ORGANIZATION>. `` They say we could be putting the Eastern diamondback in danger of extinction or something, so we've started working with them.'' But the move brought criticism from residents who are upset at the prospect of the snakes being turned loose in their southern <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> community, <PERSON> Hartzog </PERSON> said. `` I reckon some people think we're going to just dump all of them in one place,'' he added. `` That's not the case at all. We're going to release the snakes back into the wild as close to where each was caught as possible.'' Others, like veteran snake hunter <PERSON> J.P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, think the snakes should be killed because they are a danger to hunters and others. `` If they -LRB- environmentalists -RRB- could see a little child die from a rattlesnake bite like happened down here once, they'd change their tune, I think,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, the 68-year-old founder of the rattlesnake roundup. The snakes originally were caught to make the woods safer for hunters, he said. Before this year, the rodeo has raised more than $ 21,000 for charity.

<TEXT>
 Indian troops searching a northeastern jungle for rebel hideouts killed 50 Tamil guerrillas, a senior <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> diplomat said Sunday. The Indians lost eight men, including an army colonel. The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the guerrillas were killed when the Indians raided sites near <LOCATION> Mullaitivu </LOCATION>, 120 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the capital. `` Reports I have before me indicate at least 50 <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiger </ORGANIZATION> rebels died in the assault'' the Indian diplomat said. He said the Indian offensive was launched to clear the jungles of <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> who have regularly made forays into nearby villages to massacre unarmed Sinhalese civilians. `` The Indian operation, yet going on, does not involve the Sri Lankan army. We are searching jungles for the guerrillas and will continue until we flush them out'' the diplomat said. Tamil who make 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people allege they are discriminated by the majority Sinhalese who form about 75 percent of the overall population of the island off <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s southern coast. Moderate Tamils want autonomy _ while the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> are fighting for independence _ for predominantly Tamil areas of the north and east. In another incident, a Sri Lankan military official in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> said a mine blew up a jeep carrying <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lankan </LOCATION> sailors Saturday, killing five and injuring one in <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION>, 147 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. On Thursday, <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON>, foreign affairs and deputy defense minister told reporters in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> that plans were afoot to launch a joint Indian-Sri Lankan military operation to flush out <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> hiding in caves in dense jungles in northeastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. This was after marauding Tamil Tiger rebels were accused of massacring 81 Sinhalese villagers in three attacks on poorly guarded settlements in the northeast during February. The worst came February 27 when Tamil rebels shot and hacked to death 38 Sinhalese, including nine children. But the Indian diplomat said the operation was being conducted only by the Indians. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has an estimated 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to enforce a New Delhi-brokered peace accord aimed at ending the Tamil separarist war.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> needs to restore military aid to the rebels battling <PERSON> Nicaragura </PERSON>'s leftist government, a congressman said Sunday following a visit with 15,000 Contra troops in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should not only continue giving humanitarian aid -LRB- to the Contras -RRB- who are fighting the communists, but should also restore military funding,'' Rep. G.V. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss., said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> led a six-member bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> delegation that spent two days on the Nicaraguran-Hondouran border last week meeting with the Contras at their base camps. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has created a real problem by not approving more military aid to the freedom figthers,'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted in February 1988 to cut off military aid but agreed to continue $ 27 million in humanitarian aid for food and medicine until April. `` They are a fine fighting force, but it is a whole new ball game for them now because of the lack of military aid,'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said of the Contras. `` They just do n't have the means to keep fighting. `` The fight is at a standstill. They lack ammunition to keep fighting. Something has got to be done,'' he said. `` Their spirits are excellent, and their numbers have n't decreased. In fact, they are gaining more troops. `` But in May when the food stops coming, who knows what will happen.'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said the delegation discussed options, including bringing the Contras to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, or joining the Honduran government in forcing them back into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to survive the best way they can. He said the group agreed that the best option is to push for continuing humanitarian aid and to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for new military aid. `` We created the Contras to overthrow the Communists in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and I do n't think we should walk away from that commitment,'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said Sunday that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is ready to repatriate all of its Iranian prisoners of war if <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> agrees to free the Iraqis it holds, <ORGANIZATION> Baghdad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. The state-run radio quoted <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> as saying that the POW swap could be carried out independently of the stalled talks over ending the 8-year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. <ORGANIZATION> Baghdad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> as saying at a meeting with <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Coshler </PERSON>, president of the Vienna-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, a human rights group, that `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, for humanitarian and legal reasons, is fully ready to start a total exchange of prisoners with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' A comprehensive POW exchange would be a major breakthrough that could break the deadlock in implementing a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution that is the basis for the current cease-fire. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been bickering since the peace talks began Aug. 25 over how to implement the cease-fire resolution, which calls for each nation to withdraw to their pre-war borders, an exchange of prisoners of war and forming a special panel to assess blame for the war. The two sides have released a few hundred ailing and disabled prisoners since the U.N.-sponsored cease-fire took effect Aug. 20. But a full exchange has been held up because of the deadlock in the peace talks. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has registered 50,812 prisoners held by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and 19,284 Iranians in Iraqi hands. But <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and other officials estimate the total number of POWs to be about 100,000. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which claims the Iraqis still occupy border areas, insists that a troop withdrawals to the pre-war border should be the next step in the peace process. But <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> maintains that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> must abandon its right to search Iraq-bound ships in international waters of the gulf for war cargo. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has not stopped any ships since the cease-fire took effect, but reserves the right to do so.

<TEXT>
 The driver of a passenger train said Sunday that he went through a red light before slamming into the rear of another train and killing five people, a British Rail official said. But there was evidence that driver <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> tried to stop the train long before the red signal, said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettitt </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> was among 94 people injured Saturday afternoon when two London-bound passenger trains traveling from southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> wound up on the same stretch of northbound track and collided. Authorities said <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s train, traveling from <LOCATION> Littlehampton </LOCATION>, struck the rear of a train traveling from <LOCATION> Horsham </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Purley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Horsham </ORGANIZATION> train was crossing from a slow track onto the main line when it was hit from behind by the other train, they said. Thirty-one victims remained hospitalized Sunday, 10 in serious condition, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Pettitt </PERSON> said there is no evidence of sabotage and no defects have been found in the signaling equipment near the location of the collision. `` Human error is certainly a factor in our investigation, among other things,'' he said. <PERSON> Pettitt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> `` has told us that the signal at the end of the platform at <LOCATION> Purley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> was red, yet he went through it.'' `` He has not been able to offer any explanation for that,'' <PERSON> Pettitt </PERSON> told a news conference. He added that <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> was hospitalized and `` obviously injured and in shock. `` The safety of our signaling system does obviously depend on drivers stopping at red lights. It did not stop,'' <PERSON> Pettitt </PERSON> said. `` We have a system of multiple signaling where a driver gets an indication of a red light three sections back.'' `` We have quite a lot of evidence that a severe brake application was made prior to the collision and long before the signal,'' <PERSON> Pettitt </PERSON> said. He said the braking system of the <LOCATION> Littlehampton </LOCATION> train was being examined. British Rail's board has accepted responsibility for the accident, <PERSON> Pettitt </PERSON> said, and `` any claims will be sympathetically dealt with as soon as possible.'' `` It is right that we should say this to people because I am satisfied there has been nothing going on externally such as sabotage which might be involved in this accident.'' Crews worked through the night to repair the tracks and remove six coaches that rolled down a 60-foot embankment after the crash. Many came to rest in the yards of homes. Area residents attended an evening service at <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, near the crash scene, to remember the dead and to give thanks that so many survived. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> promised a full investigation into the crash, the second serious accident on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> in the last three months. Thirty-five people were killed in December in a three-train collision at <LOCATION> Clapham </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. That crash was blamed on malfunctioning signaling equipment, but an inquiry is still going on.

 Lightning sparked a house fire Sunday that killed a 7-year-old boy and his teen-age sister, but their father saved his wife and two younger children by hurling them out a second-story window, authorities said. The lightning `` came down through a tree'' and tore through the wood-frame home's tin roof around 5:50 a.m., said fire Lt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>. `` Several neighbors said it sounded like a dynamite explosion and immediately they heard some people scream,'' <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said.

 Police wielding truncheons clashed Sunday with 500 stone-throwing teen-agers in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> following a Mass in which Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> appealed for moderation, a witness said. About 10 people were arrested in the 40-minute clash in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, said a witness connected with <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The witness described the events in a telephone interview and spoke on condition of anonymity. Before the protest, supporters of the radical Fighting Solidarity splinter group handed out leaflets accusing <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> of selling out the banned Solidarity movement in his talks with the government, according to the witness. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> responded by saying there was room in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for all groups and defended his negotiating position at talks with authorities, which enter their fifth week Monday. `` I have chosen maybe a naive alternative in order to achieve reforms at the least price. There is no revolution in the direction we are going. We are entering an evolutionary path. You have to join <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on this path whether you like it or not,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. After he spoke, demonstrators marched toward a nearby railway station chanting, `` Solidarity!'' and `` Down with Communists!'' the witness said. People began throwing money at police saying, `` Do n't beat your brother for money.'' Police ordered the crowd to disperse, to no avail. They then moved in to break up the demonstration, the witness said. The crowd pelted the officers with stones, and police responded by rushing protesters and beating them with truncheons, he said. The opposition and the government have been meeting since Feb. 6 to discuss reaching a broad concensus on economic and political reforms. The talks, an outgrowth of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s crippled economy and a rash of labor unrest, may lead to legalization of Solidarity, which was outlawed after the 1981 martial-law crackdown. The talks enter their fifth week Monday with an intensive series of negotiations planned to resolve the issue of opposition participation in elections to parliament, which the communist party would like to hold in June. Both sides already have agreed that the elections will not be fully democratic, instead guaranteeing that a majority of the 460 parliament seats will be open only to candidates from the communist party and its allies. Now they are debating the format for the remaining races which will be open to Solidarity and other non-aligned candidates. It has been agreed that anyone may run who has collected 3,000 nominating signatures. Party Politburo member <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Reykowski </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday that the discussions on political reform have entered a critical phase. `` We are now, I would say, in a certain turning point. In the last few days we have had very intensive meetings,'' he said. `` We are in the middle,'' he said.'' I hope that in the second half of this week we will have a much more clear picture of what really can be achieved in this process.'' In Lodz, central <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, supporters of the banned <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> demonstrated to mark the anniversary of March 8, 1968, student riots, state television reported. The nationalist Confederation for an Independent <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> meanwhile held a congress to elect new leaders in a church in southern <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> city, said spokesman <PERSON> Zygmunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenyk </PERSON>. Police kept the meeting under surveillance, he said. Police broke up a previous attempt to hold the congress just before the start of talks on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future between the opposition and the government. <PERSON> Lenyk </PERSON> said <PERSON> Leszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Moczulski </PERSON>, who founded the anti-communist group in 1979, was elected chairman of a 12-member political council. The small but vocal movement opposes dialogue with the authorities.

There was `` a very strong general sense of an invitation for further involvement'' from the West, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. Neither side agreed on specifics, but topics included improved <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade terms and less restrictions on importing Western technology for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and restructuring of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s burgeoning foreign debt, the officials said. Before meeting with <PERSON> Varkonyi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Olechowski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> spoke with Austrian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, who welcomed him at the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> airport Sunday morning. On the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said there are no plans to end the talks that began in December after a 13-year ban. The `` real dialogue'' depends on the Arabs and Israelis staking out their positions first, the official said, speaking on condition he not be identified. On Monday, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> meets the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ the countries that have taken the lead within the 12-nation European Community to bring <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace. During a trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> three weeks ago, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was urged to seize on what the three governments see as a moderation in <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> policy toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, has had five meetings with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> since December. Talks have been dominated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criticism of raids by Palestinian guerrillas on Israeli positions in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The talks were launched after <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> publicly questioned <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s ability and willingness to control factions opposed to what it termed the `` positive evolution'' in his attitude on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials have defended the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s right to attack Israeli positions in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, saying attacks on military targets do not constitute terrorism. A Kuwaiti newspaper Saturday quoted the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s information department chief, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Abd-Rabboo </PERSON>, as saying the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> told <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` it was time to resume a serious and in-depth dialogue to prepare for an international conference.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> on Tuesday is likely to produce an agreement for <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in late April on his first trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is moving slowly on making a policy toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. It has not set a date to resume negotiations to reduce long-range nuclear weapons. Talks were suspended late last year and were supposed to resume in mid-February. East-West talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> this week involve two dialogues _ NATO-Warsaw Pact talks on reducing conventional arms and troops across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and a bigger, 35-nation forum to increase trust between the blocs. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance is pushing for sharp reductions to what it says is a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact edge of nearly 2-to-1 in tanks and artillery. The three-day meeting that begins Monday involving the 35 foreign ministers from the superpowers, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> states will concentrate on enhancing <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> security. Thursday's talks involving the 23 <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations will focus on reducing trooops and non-nuclear weapons from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the Urals.

 Big Lake musher <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buser </PERSON> was first in line and on his way to the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Range </LOCATION> on Sunday as the leaders in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race sorted themselves out in the early stages of the contest. Forty-nine mushers streaked out of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> on Saturday on the first leg of the 1,168-mile race from <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Buser </PERSON>, 30, reached the <LOCATION> Skwentna </LOCATION> checkpoint some 150 miles into the race at 3:53 a.m. AST Sunday. He and his 20-dog team were out and on his way to <LOCATION> Finger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, 45 miles farther down the trail, at 7:44 a.m. <PERSON> Buser </PERSON>, who finished third last year and paced the leaders for much of that race, was followed out by <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michael </LOCATION> at 9:13 a.m. <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> dropped two dogs at the checkpoint, leaving with 16. Four-time champion <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> of Two Rivers raced out of <LOCATION> Skwentna </LOCATION> 21 minutes later. The leaders were followed by about a dozen other mushers, including Iditarod winners <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Trapper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Manley </LOCATION> and Libby Riddles of <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>. The race, inspired by a sled-dog relay of serum to <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> for a diptheria outbreak in 1925, began in 1973. It has become the nation's most famous sled-dog and commands a first prize this year of $ 50,000 and total prize money of $ 250,000. Wind up to 46 mph that raked mushers in the first hours of the race abated Sunday and it was clear and cold. But race volunteer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobmann </PERSON> said the leaders were taking longer that normal to reach the first checkpoint. `` We think it was slow going between the wind and the ice, tough going,'' he said. From <LOCATION> Skwentna </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Buser </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> and the others headed to <ORGANIZATION> Finger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>, a wide spot in the trail with a population of two residents. From Finger Lake, the trail climbs into the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Range </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Rainy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>, the highest spot on the race route at 3,400 feet. The 17th annual race began with <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> first out of the chute. Before the contest is over, mushers will trek over the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Range </LOCATION>, across desolate expanses and along a storm-raked coastline. Riddles, 1985 champion and the first woman to win the marathon race, said she thought the cold and wind Saturday might have been good for dog teams, cooling them off in the early stretches where they tend to overheat in the excitement. Most of the Iditarod mushers are from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Others are from <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

Ms. <PERSON> Adjani </PERSON>, of French and Algerian extraction, then read several lines from `` The Satanic Verses'' of <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, who has been in hiding since Iranian clerics issued death threats last month, saying his book blasphemes Islam. `` You should know what I have suffered. ... In the artist's condition there is something extreme,'' she read `` Angels are easy to calm. Human beings ... can doubt everything.'' There was little overt reaction from the audience at the recitation, and she accepted her award and left the stage. <PERSON> Belmondo </PERSON>, 55, who had never before been nominated for a Cesar but has starred in numerous films including `` Au bout de souffle,'' -LRB- Breathless -RRB-, has said the audience reaction to his work is reward enough. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Annaud </PERSON>, whose `` L'Ours'' -LRB- The Bear -RRB- is the current box office hit in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, was awarded a Cesar for best director.

 Police fired on Tibetan protesters in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> on Sunday after an illegal Buddhist parade erupted into a riot, witnesses said, and at least 11 were reported killed and more than 100 injured. Hundreds of Tibetans demanding freedom from Chinese rule smashed windows, looted shops, restaurants and hotels and vandalized police cars in the capital of the disputed region, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said protesters began the shooting by firing on police. Foreign travelers in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> interviewed by telephone said they saw Tibetans throwing stones and looting, but saw no Tibetans with weapons. They said police used tear gas to try to break up the crowds before opening fire. The violence came on the first anniversary of another anti-Chinese demonstration in which 24 people were reported killed. It also came five days before the 30th anniversary of a failed uprising against Chinese rule that led to the exile of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION>, reporting from the <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, said early Monday that one policeman and 10 other people were killed in the riots. Among the injured were 40 policemen and more than 60 rioters. It said `` separatists'' fired at policemen and `` the police were forced to fire shots as no other means could stop the rioters.'' The report said the disturbance began at noon when 13 <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and nuns began an illegal parade in the <LOCATION> Barkhor </LOCATION> marketplace area of central <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>. It said they waved banners and shouted `` independence for <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>.'' They were joined by several hundred people who began throwing stones at a police station in <LOCATION> Barkhor </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said. About 3 p.m. -LRB- 2 a.m. EST -RRB-, about 600 rioters emerged on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, smashing windows, robbing more than 20 restaurants, hotels and shops. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said the rioters made four attacks on government and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> office buildings, smashed traffic control posts and lights and damaged more than 20 police vehicles. A Canadian tourist, <PERSON> Roch </PERSON> <PERSON> Berphiaume </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, said police first used tear gas to try to disperse the crowds and fired into the air before aiming their weapons at the crowds. <PERSON> Berphiaume </PERSON> said that before seeking safety he saw groups of Tibetan women and young men singing. Others threw rocks, he said, and ransacked Chinese-owned stores and restaurants. He did not see Tibetans with guns. `` There was a lot of firing,'' he said. He said he saw security forces `` running with machine guns and rifles.'' A stray bullet hit his third floor hotel window, he said. <PERSON> Berphiaume </PERSON> said the firing stopped around 7 p.m., then resumed about 30 minutes later when rioting broke out again for about an hour. No more shooting could be heard Monday morning, he said. `` It's pretty calm now. There were no reports of foreigners injured in the clashes, although one Swedish tourist, <PERSON> Ceijo </PERSON> <PERSON> Iskojaanta </PERSON>, said several foreigners had had their cameras confiscated. <PERSON> Iskojaanta </PERSON> said he had seen a few demonstrators waving protest banners, but the protest quickly broke down into stone-throwing. He estimated the crowd at about 1,000 at its peak. A Japanese student, <PERSON> Yuichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>, said he saw Tibetans demonstrating in front of the government building across the street. <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> said he saw police beating Tibetan demonstrators. The riots were the worst since March 5, 1988, when <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks sparked fighting at the end of a prayer festival that killed 24, according to Western travelers. At least 14 people died in rioting in September and October 1987. The most recent violent protest occurred Dec. 10, when <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> security forces killed at least one <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk and one child. Armed police have been patrolling the city in a show of force and the annual prayer festival that touched off last year's disturbance was canceled this year. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said there have been four illegal parades in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> since Feb. 13. On Feb. 22, several <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> nuns were detained by police after staging a demonstration against Chinese rule. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> claims <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> has been an integral part of it for seven centuries. Many Tibetans say the Communists usurped control when the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> moved into <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> in 1950, and call for independence under their former god-king the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, who now lives in exile in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The pro-independence uprisings have been led by <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks loyal to the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>. Although <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> now claims to guarantee religious freedom in the remote mountain region, devout Buddhists in this former theocracy hold bitter memories of Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s past efforts to suppress their religion and destroy their places of worship.

 Television viewers pledged more than $ 37 million to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Easter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> during its 18th annual weekend telethon, the head of the non-profit organization said Sunday. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of the Easter Seal, said this year's contributions totaled $ 37,002,000, surpassing last year's mark of $ 35,100,000, and a goal of $ 36 million. `` We found that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public was very supportive. We had an even stronger turnout than we expected,'' <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> said. The 20-hour 18th National Easter Seal Telethon, which aired live from 8:00 p.m. Saturday to 4:00 p.m. Sunday on local television stations nationwide, was hosted for the ninth year by singer <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>, and co-hosted by <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Frann </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Newhart'' and <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> <PERSON> Weller </PERSON> of `` Entertainment Tonight.''

<HEAD>Roving Band Of Women Blamed For Crime Spree</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A roving band of women that uses sad stories to gain access to homes may be responsible for at least 180 robberies in which elderly <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> residents lost cash, jewelry and other property, police say. Police have named the marauding thieves the `` sob-and-rob'' gang because they use sob stories to get into homes they plan to rob. One woman and two teenage girls, carrying Danish and Swedish passports, are being held in connection with the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> robberies. Lt. Det. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bissette </PERSON> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday as saying detectives doubt the girls' claims they are juveniles. He was quoted by CP as saying this is first time this type of ploy has been used in the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> area, although he has heard similar cases reported in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>. Similar reports come from some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities. <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> police say at least 90 elderly people have been robbed by the female con artists and another 90 reported thefts but refused to file formal complaints, CP said. Police in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> say families of nomadic thieves are using political refugee status, language barriers and aliases to avoid prosecution. Women, often accompanied by teenage girls, use a variety of pretexts _ such as asking for a glass of water or use of a toilet or telephone _ to gain entry into a home. Based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the gangs travel from city to city to prey on elderly homeowners. Once inside, someone distracts the homeowner while the others quietly steal any valuables in sight, officials said, according to the news agency. Before moving on, police say, the thieves ship stolen cash, jewelry, furs and oriental rugs to their home base by courier or parcel post. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sunderland </PERSON>, manager of criminal justice services for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>, says it often takes weeks before victims realize items are missing, according to Canadian Press.

 Four sons of U-Haul's 73-year-old founder scuffled after a stockholders' meeting in the latest episode in a bitter family struggle over control of the truck rental empire. `` I created a monster,'' a visibly shaken <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> said after the brawl by his sons Saturday at the Sands Regent Hotel-Casino. Hotel guards quickly broke up the fight, witnesses said. <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> has sought to regain control of U-Haul since being forced into retirement in 1986. Two of the sons involved in the fight, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON>, support their father. The other two, board Chairman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON>, oppose him. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON>, who support their brother, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, and also sit on U-Haul's board, were not involved in the fight. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON>, holding an ice pack to his cheek, said the fight occurred after the stockholders' meeting adjourned. `` They ran it in the most high-handed possible fashion even though they knew they had the votes they needed to win,'' he said. `` They were not willing to allow discussion on anything.'' During the meeting, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> and three non-family members were re-elected to the six-member board. The board chairman and his supporters refused to comment on the fight, but issued a news release pledging a back-to-basics approach in U-Haul's five-year management plan. The plan calls for an all-new truck fleet, discontinuing unprofitable operations, liquidating unused assets and an employee profit-sharing plan. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> contends the company has been devalued under <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON>'s leadership and no longer adheres to its founding principle of customer satisfaction. He also accused his son of lending money from a trust fund to several U-Haul employees to purchase stock in an effort to retain control of the company. The elder <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> set the stage for the struggle years ago when he divided 95 percent of the company's stock among 12 children from three marriages. U-Haul is now part of <ORGANIZATION> Amerco </ORGANIZATION>, whose headquarters is in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. After Saturday's meeting, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> said the only way to defuse the situation is to sell the company. `` This will have to be solved and that's the only way to solve it,'' he said.

 Owner: The 60-year-old airline has been owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, headed by Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, since 1986. Headquarters: <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.

Main strike issues: <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which claims it lost $ 1 billion in the last decade and is losing more than $ 1 million a day, sought $ 150 million in wage concessions.

Where negotiations stand: Talks under <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> supervision in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were suspended at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to appoint an emergency panel that would have delayed the strike 60 days. No new talks were scheduled.

<HEAD>Merger Impact on Industry Unclear</HEAD>

 The $ 18 billion merger agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will create the world's largest media and entertainment empire, but film industry executives are divided over its impact on independent filmmakers and the creative end of the business. The deal announced Saturday would result in the world's largest publishing, film and music conglomerate with estimated annual revenue of $ 10 billion, the companies said. The deal has raised some concern about the prospective union of a major movie studio, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, with <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> cable television subsidiary. <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> has often relied on independent studios for its product. `` In the short term, as these corporations get larger and larger, you wonder if there's going to be any room at all for independent product,'' said <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutschman </PERSON>, a board member of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Features </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, which promotes the interests of smaller filmmakers. `` But, longer term, they'll have to depend on the independents to fuel these big machines they're building.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s not suddenly going to make 60 movies a year just because they have more money, and I'm sure <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> is going to keep making deals just the way they always did,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Pathe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The merger agreement is part of a series of consolidations under way for several years in the media and entertainment fields, but executives doubted it would force other studios to join the trend. `` Is this going to put pressure on us to grow? No. Larger is sometimes better and sometimes not,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The merger probably will not affect the number of studios able to mount a film project and will thus have little impact on producers, writers, actors and directors, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiatt </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> talent agency. `` You wo n't lose a player in this. It just creates a remarkable empire,'' he said.

 A federal judge Sunday barred sympathy strikes by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-area </LOCATION> railroad workers and striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> pledged not to picket any rail lines, easing fears of Monday morning commuting disruptions nationwide. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order against three major rail lines that carry 320,000 commuters daily between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and northern suburbs. The threat of confrontations with rail workers and commuter snarls evaporated when the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> then said it would not picket any of the nation's 12 commuter railroads or <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> will not set up picket lines at any rail carrier's property at this time,'' union vice president <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterpaul </PERSON> said `` We do n't want any <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> member or members of other unions to violate the court's order or put themselves in a position that could jeopardize their jobs.'' But <PERSON> Peterpaul </PERSON> he said the Machinists will file an emergency appeal of the judge's order Monday. `` When the court upholds our position we are prepared to establish appropriate picket lines,'' he said. Secondary boycotts on air and rail travel are legal under the 1926 National Railway Labor Act but injunctions may be sought on the grounds the actions would widely disrupt public transportation service. `` There should be no problems. We're not going to violate the order,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Yule </PERSON>, general chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents conductors and train workers on the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commuter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The 41,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday reiterated a pledge to begin a rule-book slowdown at 6 a.m. Tuesday that could delay every flight in the country. `` We see major disruptions and major changes in the whole air system as a result of the Eastern shutdown,'' association president <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The move by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> came after officials in major cities set up contingency plans to brace for possible secondary strikes. _ In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, officials had readied 150 public and private buses in case of a sympathy strike that would affect service to 35,000 suburban commuters The <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> asked commuters to carpool, stagger work hours and rely on the buses only as a last resort because they could not accommodate the full load. _ <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, which carries 33,000 passengers daily in the <LOCATION> Boston-Washington </LOCATION> corridor and 28,000 elsewhere, said it would add 12 high-speed trains between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> daily if no sympathy strikes occurred tohelp compensate for reduced service on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Northeast shuttle _ In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, a transport union official said members would obey an injunction against a sympathy strike in the city Local police had been asked to enforce the order in case of pickets in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and its suburbs. _ In <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, a computerized telephone operator for <ORGANIZATION> MARC </ORGANIZATION>, the communter rail between <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, had warned callers of delays because of possible secondary strikes _ <ORGANIZATION> Greyhound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said 200 additional buses were on stand-by on the the Eastern seaboard Greyhound said it was planning special non-stop shuttle service between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The order signed by the federal judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> covers the <ORGANIZATION> LIRR </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION>. It lasts until a hearing Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> LIRR </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannizzaro </PERSON> said `` we expect our employees to report to work so that we can provide normal service to our passengers.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> fired the latest salvo in the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s four-way newspaper war, trying to lure both the brainy and the brawny in a new Sunday edition combining savvy with sports. The tabloid, which has a third-place circulation of about 600,000, pushed its eclectic new image with a front-page article on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbrenner </PERSON> by literary journalist <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Ephron </PERSON>. If sophistication was not a draw, there was <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> the Menace and Uncle Art's Funland, in color. The cartoons formerly ran in black and white on Saturdays. For those hooked on the weekday Post's fare of politics and crime, the front page headlined an exclusive in three-inch letters: `` Koch ` Hit Men' Booted,'' on the secret deportation of two Colombians believed to have been sent to kill Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. And there were sports, sports and more sports. Post President <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> pushed the button that started the presses for the Sunday edition of the nation's oldest continuously published daily at 7:55 p.m. Saturday. The Tuxedo-clad <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> uncorked a bottle of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> champagne and poured glasses for cheering pressmen in ink-stained coveralls and paper hats. Later, <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> led them into the area where 575,000 Sunday papers were bundled and packed off for delivery. Publisher <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> handed out free copies of the paper Sunday to travelers arriving at La Guardia airport. A year ago, <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON>, a developer, saved the 188-year-old newspaper from extinction by buying it from media mogul <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> for $ 37 million. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> threatened to close the money-losing paper if he could n't find a buyer. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> now competes seven days a week for readers and advertisers with the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> edition of Newsday, the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> daily. The Post is third in the city circulation race, trailing the News -LRB- 1,281,706 -RRB- and the Times -LRB- 1,038,829 -RRB- and leading <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Newsday -LRB- 176,043 in the city, and 706,440 overall -RRB-, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circulations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> is trying to lure the more than 300,000 people who read both the daily <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, but who may not want to carry home the slicker Sunday version of his paper, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lois </PERSON>, who created an advertising campaign for the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. The Post, which like many newspapers expects to obtain most of its advertising revenue from its Sunday edition, `` is fully booked with ads for the next four weeks,'' said <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> said he expects to spend $ 22 million to $ 25 million on the Sunday Post in the first year. He said it would be months before he knows if the move has paid off. Many media analysts have said they are skeptical that the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market can support a fourth Sunday newspaper.

 The Earth's fragile ozone layer will continue to deteriorate until the end of the century even if all ozone-destroying chemicals are banned immediately, an American expert said Sunday. <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, one of the scientists who discovered the dangers of compounds known as chlorofluorocarbons, said it would take centuries to repair the shield that filters the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays. `` Even if we had a total ban tomorrow, and there were no further emissions, we would expect things to get worse until about the end of the century, and then gradually recover over two centuries,'' said <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, professor of atmospheric chemistry at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>'s comments came during a 120-nation ozone conference that began Sunday. <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> told reporters many of the compounds already released in the atmosphere have not reached the stratosphere, 15-25 miles above the earth. At that altitude, they are broken apart and the liberated chlorine atoms destroy the ozone. The compounds also trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to the greenhouse effect, which could cause major climatic changes, scientists say. Some of the compounds can last as long as 100 years. They are widely used in aerosols, refrigeration, air conditioning and fast-food packaging. Chlorine levels in the atmosphere would not return to the levels of the 1960s until the 22nd or 23rd century, <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> agreed `` it will take many many decades, possibly even several centuries'' to restore the ozone layer. Soviet delegate <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhakarov </PERSON> said the timetable for eliminating cholorofluorocarbons should `` not be on the basis of emotions.'' <PERSON> Zhakarov </PERSON> also said Soviet data indicated the ozone layer over parts of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the western <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had been depleted by up to 25 percent in winter, but that it was partly due to natural causes. `` This depletion occurs every 10 to 15 days,'' he said. `` It moves from west to east. It coincides with the movement of cyclones during this time.'' President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> arap </PERSON> <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, who opened the conference, said all countries had an obligation to protect the atmosphere, but that developing countries would need help from the industrial nations. <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> urged all countries that have not yet signed the 1987 <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> Protocol _ calling for the compound emissions to be halved by the year 2000 _ to `` join us in the endeavor to protect our planet.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s environment secretary, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>, told the conference six more countries _ <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> _ agreed to join the 40 that have signed it. Some countries have gone further, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which plans to eliminate all chlorofluorocarbons and similar compounds known as halons by 1999. The 12-member <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> agreed to a similar target last week, and Commissioner <PERSON> Ripa </PERSON> <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Meana </PERSON> told the conference he hoped for a total European ban `` well before the end of the century ...'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said whether that target is possible `` remains to be seen'' and depends largely on how soon alternatives can be developed. <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON>, a vice president for the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> chemical company, said it hopes to begin selling chlorofluorocarbon alternatives by the mid-1990s. `` There is no single compound that has the complete range of properties offered by the -LRB- chlorofluorocarbon -RRB- it is targeted to replace,'' <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON> said. `` All will represent a compromise, whether it be in flammability, toxicity, energy efficiency, suitability for existing equipment or performance in use.'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said he brought with him a letter from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> saying `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> attaches the highest priority to the international environment.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said countries which produce and use the compounds `` have a heavier responsibility than others'' to resolve the problem. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the leading producer of the compounds, followed by <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> opened a conference on the greenhouse effect, saying his country could suffer most from global warming because most of the population lives in flood-prone regions. R.M. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, a Canadian scientist presenting the conference's main report, said recent research showed higher temperatures increase water vapor, which could lead to heavier rainfall
