<HEAD>Women Promise to Lift Curse From Family; Instead Make Off With $10,000</HEAD>

 Two women who told a man they were removing an evil curse placed upon him and his family made off with his $ 9,500 life savings plus $ 500 he borrowed from his daughter, authorities said. The women took the $ 10,000 from <PERSON> Guadenecio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Soliven </PERSON> and promised to bless it, but disappeared sometime late Wednesday, police Detective Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaida </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Soliven </PERSON> told authorities the scam began Monday when a middle-aged woman stopped him on the street and told him he was troubled by evil spirits but that she could help him. `` She told me a relative wanted to do something to make me get sick and die,'' said <PERSON> Soliven </PERSON> who moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> last March. `` She told me I could have a spiritual healing to drive off the evil spirts. It would cure me and all my family.'' He said he followed the woman to a house where she and a second woman chanted and rubbed raw eggs on him. The women asked for $ 10,000 to combat the spirits, <PERSON> Soliven </PERSON> said. He said he took the $ 9,500 he had in the bank out in three separate withdrawals over two days and borrowed another $ 500 from his daughter. `` It was my whole life savings,'' he said. `` But they told me if I did n't have full trust in them, the power of the ritual would be lost.'' The women put the money in a handkerchief to bless it, <PERSON> Soliven </PERSON> said. When he returned to the house late Wednesday, the women were gone. In the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Soliven </PERSON> said, black magic is powerful. `` People cast spells on others,'' he said. `` I've seen people with my own eyes who suffer without any cause, and I was afraid of this.''

 Justice goofed, but a near-frantic woman found a judge who was sensitive to her holiday plight, despite his tough reputation. State Judge <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said he found the woman in tears as she was going from courthouse door to courthouse door trying to find one open. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> woman, who had driven from <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, had been ordered to be in <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' court `` without fail'' Friday morning or risk being held in contempt, he said. But the person who wrote the summons was in error. The courthouse was closed Friday for the Thanksgiving holiday.

 Members of Drunk Drivers Against Driving Drunk say they hope their painful experiences will encourage others not to flirt with the dangerous pastime of drinking and driving. `` We're like blood brothers,'' said member <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON>. `` We've been to the pits and now we've been able to get our lives back together again and we want to be able to go out into the community and tell them and explain to them why -LRB- drunken drivers -RRB- have to be controlled. I think somebody who's been through it three times has got a pretty good insight into it.'' <LOCATION> DDADD </LOCATION>, made up of about a dozen people, including advisers, was formed three years ago by people who had been sent to the Western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Correctional Center for multiple drunken driving offenses, group coordinator <PERSON> Roz </PERSON> <PERSON> Canter </PERSON> said. However, the group is not affiliated with the center, which was created to house the increased number of people sent to jail when <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> toughened its drunken driving laws. DDADD members speak at programs for drunken driving offenders about `` how we got there and the things that brought us to our knees,'' <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> said. He said the group does not include anyone who was involved in a fatal crash. `` My story was that I had a 32-year history of abuse of drugs and alcohol and I reached a point where I was convicted of three DUI's in the course of 18 months,'' he said. The loss of his home, friends and possessions coupled with a barrage of counseling helped him admit to having a problem, <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> said. `` I was lucky,'' he said. `` I drove many many times under the influence of alcohol but fortunately I never hurt any one. I cracked up cars.'' The 51-year-old tool-and-die maker said he got away with driving drunk for more than two decades, but tougher driving laws promoted by Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sent him to the correctional center. `` It's the best thing that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did,'' he said. Despite its masculine sounding acronym, there are women in DDADD and <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> said the name was n't meant as a challenge to the well-known <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION>, Mothers Against Drunk Driving. DDADD was formally incorporated in August under the name <ORGANIZATION> Former </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drivers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Driving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drunk </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Canter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, assistant director of public affairs at the national headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Hurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said the concept of former drunken drivers voluntarily engaging in educational efforts appeared to be new. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Nepomuceno </PERSON> of the local chapter of <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION> said she thought the appearance of DDADD was a good thing. `` They are taking responsibility now for their choices,'' she said. `` The hardest part for the victim is that -LRB- drunken drivers -RRB- never really say that they're sorry. But I think to hear a group of people that has been driving drunk and are now really saying that they're sorry for what they've done. ... I think it's a big step.'' <PERSON> Canter </PERSON> said the group has kept a low profile. `` Basically what they do, they do n't point the finger at people, they just share their own personal experiences of what happened to them to try to encourage other people to not have to go through the things they went through,'' <PERSON> Canter </PERSON> said.

 The quake of'89 rattled the director of an organization dedicated to preserving the little shacks that housed refugees from the earthquake and fire of'06. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Cryan </PERSON>, who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appreciation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shacks </ORGANIZATION>, has decided to pull up stakes and leave quake-prone <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` This little society, born of the quake, has died of another,'' said <PERSON> Cryan </PERSON>, who founded the organization after she unknowingly bought a refugee shack in the early 1980s. <PERSON> Cryan </PERSON>, 47, said the Oct. 17 earthquake that hit <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> `` threw me for a loop.'' `` I have decided to begin life anew in my home state of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and am returning to my ancestral town of <LOCATION> Oshkosh </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Cryan </PERSON>, who also lost her job as an administrative assistant shortly after the quake. `` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> will undoubtedly undergo seismic upgrades that will obliterate the shacks,'' she said. `` I could n't bear to be around to see it.'' More than 60 of the 5,610 redwood cottages known to exist are still standing, said <PERSON> Cryan </PERSON>. The cottages, some as small as 10 by 14 feet, were designed by <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> engineers and built with federal funds and donations in public parks and squares. There were 11 shack camps around the city. The families were given the cottages when they moved the structures to private land. There was no <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale when the quake hit on April 18, 1906, but the magnitude was later figured to be 8.3. The quake and the fire that followed killed somewhere from 700 to 2,000 people. Last month's temblor measured 7.1 and killed 67 people, more than half of them on a freeway that collapsed in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. The shacks were put into service after the 1906 quake and fire while 25,000 people were still living in canvas Army tents in parks around <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. After living in the shack cities, more than 5,000 families resettled and took their shacks with them, dragging them away with horses. The structures ended up scattered all over the city. <PERSON> Cryan </PERSON> was living in one of the old cottages and did n't even know it. `` Someone told me the house was a refugee cottage and I checked it out,'' she said. `` That was about three months after I moved in. It was three of them joined together. I got it recognized as a landmark.'' <PERSON> Cryan </PERSON> has accumulated shack doors, windows and other memorabilia through the years. She's `` passing the society's torch'' to her friend <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Falcon </PERSON>, who is storing the items that include an architectural model of a shack town of 22 cottages. <PERSON> Cryan </PERSON> says the shacks were `` the original modular housing.'' `` They feel like homes, they make you feel safe and cozy, even though they're small.''

 Prosecutors are asking a federal appeals court to revive the criminal case against a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> who was caught up in the Iran-Contra affair. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, dismissed criminal charges against <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> on Friday, ruling <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> could not get a fair trial because the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> barred use of classified materials considered important to the defense. Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office quickly filed a notice of appeal with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. Prosecutors said the ruling places <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> outside the law. `` We believe that all citizens _ including high-ranking government officials involved in covert operations _ should be accountable to the law,'' said associate independent counsel <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Shtasel </PERSON>, who is prosecuting the <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> case. Prosecutors are appealing both the judge's ruling Friday and his July decision to reject proposed substitutions for the secrets. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> assisted former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secret Contra resupply effort during a congressional ban on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras. The effort in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was financed partly by diverted profits from secret arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> was charged with two counts of obstruction of justice and two counts of making false statements. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> on Wednesday barred courtroom use of classified materials <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said would prove his case. The secrets _ said by the judge to be `` essential to this defendant'' _ concern <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> stations and programs in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> has claimed some activities to help <PERSON> North </PERSON> were intertwined with U.S.-assisted plans by <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> against possible invasion by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> says, for example, that he did not lie when he told the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general an airstrip built by the North network was initiated by the Costa Rican government. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said after <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling Friday that he feared <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operatives performing `` legitimate duties'' could be subjected to a `` politically motivated prosecution.'' `` That is a chilling message to people who put their lives on the line every day,'' he said. Iran-Contra prosecutors have said much of the classified information the government is protecting constitutes `` fictional secrets'' which have been revealed publicly before. But <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said the secrets would compromise national security and added that its disclosure would have compromised intelligence sources. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> suggested an agreement could be reached with <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to allow a trial for <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. `` I continue to believe that this case can be tried without compromising the defendant's right to a fair trial or the national security of this country,'' he said in a statement Friday. `` The independent counsel and I agree that the district court's earlier rejection of substitutions and alternatives to the release of classified material constituted reversible error.''

The meeting came the week before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flies to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> for a two-day summit meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, although officials say Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s visit was scheduled before that summit was arranged. The prime minister told a press conference she does not expect `` great or unusual pronouncements from this -LRB- Bush-Gorbachev -RRB- meeting.'' `` I do n't think there will be a great deal of difficulty or sudden surprises about this meeting,'' she said. As to nervousness from some quarters that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s support for East block reform efforts might foreshadow a diminished role for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> forces, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said, `` <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> is absolutely vital'' to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s continued defense. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> described <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> as `` in very close accord in their examination of all the issues discussed today,'' which included the possible topics for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Dec. 2-3 shipboard meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> off the coast of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. That included support for glasnost and perestroika, the new Soviet openness and economic restructuring that have led to changes within the borders of Soviet allies, he said. `` They both emphasized the pursuit of democracy as the first step in the reform process,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. As he greeted Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> at Camp David, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted to get her views `` on the rapid changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the strength of the alliance and everything else.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> in her news conference later described their talks as `` very relaxed, very valuable.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has sought to assure Western allies the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not act unilaterally on matters of concern to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, such as the role of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, promising them `` no surprises'' in his talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview with foreign journalists released Friday that he is `` prepared to think anew'' about reducing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop levels abroad in light of East-bloc rapid changes but wo n't act unilaterally <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will meet with President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Dec. 16 in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> to discuss the summit and other issues. French officials said the meeting would be held on the island of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told reporters she and the president did not differ on the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> question. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> met as <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s entire hardline <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership resigned in the wake of massive pro-democracy protests, and <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON>, a former party leader of the <LOCATION> Czech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, was elected to replace the party leader. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told reporters she hoped to see <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> become a democracy. `` But the wish is not the deed and it does take quite a long time to get all the democratic structures into place. And they must be genuine structures not just a facade,'' she said.

<HEAD>Group Unwraps Hazards in Holiday Gift Toys</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A consumer group is warning that stores nationwide this holiday season are offering toys that violate federal safety standards and pose a choking hazard for young children. `` On this, the biggest shopping day of the year, parents should not assume that the toys they find on the shelves are safe,'' said <PERSON> Lucinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON>, consumer director for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, on Friday, the start of the holiday shopping season. Inadequate funding and staffing for state and federal enforcement agencies to monitor dangerous toys are one reason the group founded by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> blamed for the availability of the items. <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON> said there are particular dangers `` for children who still tend to put things in their mouths.'' `` Shoppers should carefully examine toys for small parts that break off or are detachable,'' <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON> cautioned. The warnings came as <ORGANIZATION> PIRG </ORGANIZATION> released its first national survey of unsafe toys. Efforts to reach several toy manufacturers whose products are named in the survey were unsuccessful. A spokesman for the federal <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said the agency would collect and test samples of the toys and `` take appropriate action'' if needed. The survey, titled `` Small Parts, Big Hazards: Unsafe Toys in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' was conducted in October and November in 105 stores in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The report focused on small parts that are regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> and which `` continue to be the leading cause of toy-related deaths to young children,'' the group said. Thirty-four children died in toy-related incidents between January 1988 and September 1989, according to <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> figures cited in the report. The report called for `` mandatory, descriptive age labeling legislation,'' saying many toys are inappropriately labeled. Currently toy makers voluntarily include age labeling on toys. However, toys intended for children under age three must meet federal standards for small parts. A toy or a toy part that fits into a truncated cylinder with a diameter of 1.25 inches and a depth ranging from 1 to 2.25 inches fails the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> small parts test. The cylinder is designed to replicate a child's windpipe, said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Giles </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION>. The toys cited were recommended for children ages 9 months to six years or included no age label. Those recommended for children under age three that do not meet the small parts requirements violate government standards, <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> said. He said the Oregon <ORGANIZATION> PIRG </ORGANIZATION> had notified the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> about 12 toys it found in stores in the state that may pose a small parts hazard. The national survey is modeled after one conducted annually by the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> group since 1986. <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> said the agency would collect and test samples of the 12 toys and `` take appropriate action.'' `` We will do the same for the larger list as soon as we get it,'' he added.

<HEAD>Darman Plan Puts Agencies on the Spot for Spending</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 White House budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> wants to use a novel budget review process to help the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration meet its deficit reduction goals. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, has told administration officials that <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> will use a two-track approach to reviewing their budgets this year that will force them to compete with other high-priority programs for a limited pool of extra money. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s strategy, revealed this week in a letter to agency heads, leaves federal budget officers scrambling for ways to convince the White House to overturn proposed <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> cuts in their spending requests for the 1991 fiscal year. Many budget officers planned to be at their desks through this weekend to meet a Monday deadline for submitting their appeals of <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> decisions on their budgets. The administration is racing to meet a Jan. 8 deadline for submitting its new budget to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the first full budget submission President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will get to make. Last February, he submitted various revisions to the budget left by former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Federal agencies submitted their initial requests to <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 1. Last Monday, they got the news on what reduced funding levels <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> will be recommending. The <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> proposals were accompanied by a letter from <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> explaining a new appeal process the agencies must follow in trying to overturn budget office decisions. Previously, `` an agency would recommend a very big increase,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said in an interview taped Friday on the `` <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Novak'' for broadcast on the <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> `` would say, no, no, that's too much, and then the fight would be within that range. And there was a tendency for presidents to come along and split the difference, so you would always be leveling up. `` What this is saying is, if anybody has ideas for meritorious investment, as they see it, fine. Let's have them compete against all other such good ideas, and in the end we'll take the best ideas,'' said <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>. Part of the process is similar to previous years. Agencies will be able to negotiate with <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> over the proposed spending reductions. But if an agency decides to carry its appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> has added a new twist. The appeal will automatically toss the program onto a second budget track in which the increased spending will be competing with other programs that are bidding for higher spending. In his letter, first revealed in Friday's <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said the agencies seeking increases `` will have to compete with each other ... for resources that are in a limited pool.'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> assured <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretaries that `` you will have an opportunity to present your views directly to the president prior to his decision.'' But agency budget officials said <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s strategy puts the budget office in a strong negotiating position to defend its recommended cuts. For one thing, the amount of time <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have to devote to budget appeal hearings will be limited by other issues the president must address, such as the upcoming Soviet summit. Given the Jan. 8 deadline for submitting a budget to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, all spending decisions will have to be made by mid-December. `` There will be limited opportunities for even making presentations to the president, given his travel schedule,'' said one budget officer, who spoke on condition his name not be used. In a meeting with reporters earlier in the week, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> stressed the administration is facing a big challenge in meeting a goal to reduced the deficit to $ 64 billion. That deficit target is for the 1991 fiscal year, which begins next Oct. 1. The administration reached agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this week on $ 14.6 billion in deficit cuts aimed at meeting this year's overall Gramm-Rudman deficit target of $ 100 billion.

<HEAD>Secretary Derwinski Delays Agent Orange Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Veterans' Affairs Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> says he wo n't decide before March whether to grant disability payments to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans exposed to Agent Orange. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said Friday he wo n't make his decision until the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> releases the results of a study begun in 1985. The study is expected in March. After a Nov. 3 advisory committee meeting, <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> had promised a decision in a few weeks. <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> epidemiologists in 1985 launched a major study of the health records of thousands of veterans to see if they were at increased risk of five types of cancer: lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, and nasal, nasopharyngeal and liver cancer. The advisory committee said after reviewing more than 30 studies that it could not find a statistically significant relationship between a rare cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and exposure to the chemicals used in the defoliant Agent Orange. In May, a federal judge in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> ruled that the department had been too strict in denying disability benefits on the grounds there was no proof that those chemicals caused the illnesses cited by some 34,000 veterans. Instead, the judge said the department need only find statistically significant associations between exposure and illness. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> decided not to appeal the decision. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said in a statement Friday that several committee members had said the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> study could weigh heavily in their recommendations. `` I am as determined now to resolve this issue as I was when I decided not to appeal the court decision, but it is logical to wait for a few extra months for the results of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> cancer study,'' he said. Agent Orange, used in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to strip vegetation cover used by guerrillas, has been blamed by veterans' groups for many disorders, particularly cancer, because it was contaminated with dioxins, a byproduct of its manufacture. Some of the 75 dioxin compounds are among the most powerful causes of cancer ever tested in laboratory animals, but it has never been proven they can cause cancer in humans. Exposure to dioxin in high concentrations is known to cause chloracne, a skin disorder, and recent work has led some scientists to suspect dioxin may also cause birth defects. In 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> required the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to give hospital care to any veteran exposed to Agent Orange in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> unless the VA found some other cause for his disability.

<TEXT>
 Like the addict who admits he has a problem, a casino operator has conceded that compulsive gambling is a disease and some of its patrons and employees are infected. So far, <ORGANIZATION> Harrah </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stands alone in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> in its public confession that the state's No. 1 industry and its biggest taxpayer is more than recreational fun for up to six million Americans. `` We did n't know if it existed,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harrah </PERSON>'s general counsel and chairman of an employee task force that studied compulsive gambling for more than a year before recommending the company help addicts Last month, <PERSON> Harrah </PERSON>'s posted signs in its five <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> casinos telling people how to get help for gambling problems. The company also agreed to pay one year's costs to operate a hotline to take those calls. `` Our role in the problem gambling issue is not to change anyone's behavior, but simply to provide help for people who might have a gambling problem,'' said <PERSON> Harrah </PERSON>'s President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Satre </PERSON>. As many as 12 percent of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> casino employees are compulsive gamblers, according to some estimates. Seven percent to 9 percent of Nevadans share the problem, compared to 2 percent to 5 percent of the general <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population. To those who find it dicey for a casino owner to be helping people overcome a disease that seems to boost business, <PERSON> Satre </PERSON> responds that treatment could diminish employee absenteeism, petty theft and misconduct. Casinos would be better off without addicted gamblers who are trouble because they can run up huge debts and sometimes become angry or abusive when on a losing streak, he said. `` Helping employees and guests with this problem is both the right thing to do and also a very good businesses decision, not only for <PERSON> Harrah </PERSON>'s but for the entire gaming industry,'' <PERSON> Satre </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, casinos have had such hotlines in place since gaming began in 1978, and spend $ 300,000 a year to help compulsive gamblers. In <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, casinos have all but ignored gambling addicts since betting was legalized 58 years ago. For the state, which receives more than half its annual revenues from casino taxes, declaring gambling a problem would be akin to admitting some of the golden eggs laid by the gaming goose are really fool's gold, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` For now, I think most of the casinos are watching the <PERSON> Harrah </PERSON>'s program to see what kind of effect it has,'' he said Casinos paid $ 73.6 million into the state treasury on earnings of $ 1.21 billion in the July-September quarter, according to the state <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dian </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, volunteer executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Compulsive Gambling, which runs the Las Vegas-based hotline, said most <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> casino operators are like the addicted gambler who denies he has a problem. `` We just need to do a lot more education because there's still this Wild West mentality out there that gambling's just fun,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said the month-old hotline gets three to five calls daily. Most calls come from friends and family of addicted gamblers, she said. The ones from bettors do n't last long. `` There's a real problem of denial involved in this just like for alcohol and drug addicts,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, a mental health therapist. Only one certified hospital exists in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> to help compulsive gamblers, she said, and insurance companies do n't recognize the problem as a disease like alcoholism or drug addiction. `` We're just in the beginning stages of addressing this problem,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said publicity about <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> manager suspended for life from baseball for betting on the game, has helped gained legitimacy for people treating compulsive gambling. According to various studies, the typical gambler is male betwen the ages of 20 and 40, lives with his spouse and has at least a high school education. `` I can walk through a casino and tell you who the compulsive gamblers are,'' she added. `` They're mesmerized by the machines. They're in love with them. They ca n't take their eyes off them. It's frightening.''

 The five Discovery astronauts worked under a shroud of secrecy today while testing the shuttle's control systems in preparation for a Sunday landing in the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> A news blackout ordered by the military has prevented <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> from talking about its classified mission, but sources said the crew's main goal was to deploy a spy satellite Discovery is scheduled to land Sunday at 7:02 p.m. PST at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. It will be the third after-dark landing in 32 shuttle flights. While the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> has been mum about all aspects of the mission since Thursday, it is assumed that the commander and pilot Friday tested the shuttle's flight control systems and steered thrusters to make sure they are ready for the trip back home _ a fiery, hourlong dive through the Earth's atmosphere. Besides deploying a spy satellite, the Discovery astronauts reportedly have been conducting experiments for the Strategic Defense Initiative missile defense system. Neither <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> nor the Pentagon would discuss the release of the satellite or other mission objectives. The last official status report _ issued Thursday night by <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> _ stated that the `` crew is doing well and the orbiter continues to perform satisfactorily.'' Sources close to the project said the astronauts had accomplished their main goal of deploying a 2 -LCB- - ton, $ 300 million satellite capable of monitoring military and diplomatic communications in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> The Discovery mission is the fifth shuttle flight dedicated solely to military research.

 <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON>, an obscure, unknown bureaucrat picked Friday as the new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, represents the party's best hope of restoring the authority it has lost in two decades of hard-line policy. News that his predecessor, <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, had resigned brought a throng of people into the streets of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> in a spontaneous explosion of joy. Reaction to the choice of <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON>, however, was reserved. <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON>, 48, joined the old 13-man Politburo 13 months ago. Since then, according to a senior Western diplomat, <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> has spent much of his time traveling in the provinces and apparently has gained support from regional party chiefs. His most recent responsibilities as head of a new council for the party in the <LOCATION> Czech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION> should have given him clear insight into the state of the economy and the party's standing in <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION> and his native <LOCATION> Moravia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON>'s greatest asset is his relative obscurity. Under Communist Party custom, the general secretary must come from Politburo ranks. Of the 13 men available, <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> was one of the few not directly associated with the unpopular hard-line policies in place since 1968, and thus has a chance to restore the party's flagging standing. The official <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency said <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> was elected general secretary in a secret ballot of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, with 136 votes for and seven against. It was not known if there were any abstentions. What little is known of <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> suggests that in the past he has been an orthodox Communist. In an article in the party weekly Tribuna in March, <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> took the standard line of acknowledging shortcomings in the present system but excluding independent groups from dialogue. He wrote that prominent dissidents `` are not concerned with democracy, freedom and the environment, with dialogue in the realm of Socialism, but with a return to capitalism with all the consequences this would have for our country. `` It is therefore impossible to give in to them,'' he wrote. Born March 22, 1941, at <LOCATION> Bojkovice </LOCATION> in south <LOCATION> Moravia </LOCATION> to a peasant family, <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1963, studied at an industrial school and joined Czechoslovak railways as a station master in his hometown in 1970. In 1973, he became part of the regional <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> committee in south <LOCATION> Moravia </LOCATION> while studying part-time at the party's institute in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> By 1982, he had risen to head the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brno </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Moravia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s third-largest city. In March 1988, he made it onto the influential <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> apparatus. Seven months later, he vaulted on to the ruling party Politburo in a reshuffle that saw four other men named to the ruling body. At the same time, he was made head of the newly created <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Work </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Czech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which until then had not had its own <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> organization _ something that existed in <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION> since 1969. He also was named head of a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> commission for the political system in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Other details of his personal life were not known.

<TEXT>
 The skipper of the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> will try to get his case dismissed by claiming immunity from prosecution and seeking to have the results of a sobriety test thrown out of court. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> is expected to return to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> for a hearing on the motions in the <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that begins Monday and could last up to two weeks. His trial is set for Jan. 22. The 43-year-old mariner from <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, was fired by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> soon after the tanker Exxon Valdez struck a Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> reef March 24 and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil. The worst oil spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history blackened pristine shores, killed tens of thousands of birds and marine mammals and disrupted lucrative fishing seasons. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said it spent more than $ 1 billion on oil spill claims and cleanup work, and state officials say the cleanup still is not finished. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> faces misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil, and three felony counts of criminal mischief. If convicted of the three felonies, he faces a possible maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and $ 100,000 in fines. The case was moved from <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> because of concerns publicity about the spill would make it too hard to find an impartial jury in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. The southcentral <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> port town relies heavily on the oil industry for jobs and also has commercial fishing interests. Defense motions include claims that <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> received immunity from prosecution when he reported his ship's grounding and oil spill the morning it happened. A law designed to encourage self-reporting of environmental calamities such as oil spills provides protection against self-incrimination, laywers contend. They say virtually every piece of evidence in the case against <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> grew from his report to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> that the Exxon Valdez was aground and leaking oil. State lawyers have pointed out that it would have been hard for the massive oil spill to go undiscovered. Another defense motion asserts that the sobriety test <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> failed about 10 hours after the ship struck <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON> <PERSON> Reef </PERSON> was administered improperly, and that the results can not be used as evidence. Defense lawyers say the sample was obtained so long after the grounding that it did not provide a sound measure of <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s condition at the time of the wreck

<TEXT>
 Two commandos from the elite <ORGANIZATION> Bracamonte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION> materialize out of the shadows near a Jesuit parish house. They stop a departing visitor. `` Who are you looking for?'' one demands coldly. `` What do you want? Show me your identification.'' The church is suspect in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, denounced by the right and persecuted as subversive because it has become a force for social change, a voice that denounces rights abuses. It threatens the status quo in a country where a handful are wealthy and the majority live in ignorance, poverty and disease and those who try to change things risk torture and death. It is also a country torn by a civil war pitting a leftist guerrilla force against a succession of U.S.-backed governments _ a war that has taken more than 71,000 lives. After the massacre of six Jesuit priests last week, Attorney General <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Colorado </PERSON> accused Archbishop <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> and auxiliary Bishop <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> of fomenting leftist violence. He wrote to <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> that the prelates should be pulled out of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> for their own good. The clerics, he said, have `` persisted in keeping alive the questionable ideology of the ` church of the poor''' and are blamed for `` much of the violence that has devastated <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> for many years and culminated in the rebel actions of this week ...'' More than 1,000 people were killed in the 11-day offensive. A dozen years ago, a Jesuit activist, the Rev. <PERSON> Rutilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Grande </PERSON>, asked what would happen if <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` They'd accuse him of being a rebel, a foreign Jew, of getting mixed up in exotic and strange ideas ... they'd crucify him,'' <PERSON> Grande </PERSON> said in a homily in the rural parish where he worked among the poor. He was dead less than a month later, gunned down by a death squad on his way to say Mass. <PERSON> Grande </PERSON> was one of the first priests to fall in the bloody attempt to suppress church activism in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Dozens of priests, nuns and lay workers have been murdered since, including the six Jesuit academics. Teachers, nurses, doctors, social workers, academics _ all are suspect. <PERSON> Grande </PERSON>'s life and death symbolized the new role for the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. For hundreds of years, the church had worked with the Spanish conquerors and colonial rulers and with the oligarchs that followed. Ignore the misery of life on earth, it taught, and await your celestial reward. There were few dissenting voices. In 1968, a Latin American bishop's conference in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, decided the church should tend the material needs of the poor as well as their spiritual needs, calling it a `` preferential option for the poor.'' Instead of counseling forbearance from the sidelines, many clerics now felt their duties included standing at the side of parishioners trying to do things such as organize peasant cooperatives that might ease their crushing poverty. As war devastated <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>, the importance of churches and church workers, both <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and Protestant, grew. Churches are virtually the only humanitarian institutions that have continued to function throughout a decade of bitter civil war between leftist guerrillas and a series of U.S.-backed governments. In a nation where political violence has fragmented families and displaced hundreds of thousands, the only place to turn is often a church. In some rural areas churches and church workers are the only source of social services, health care and education as well as spiritual nourishment. The church is also at the heart of the intellectual life of this Massachusetts-sized nation of 5 million. The university where the priests were massacred is one of the most respected institutions of higher learning in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s right _ wealthy landowners and businessmen and their military allies _ have raged at the sight of the church's inherent power and influence standing shoulder-to-shoulder with ideas they consider subversive While the many in the churches blame the war on social and economic factors, the right blames the conflict on those who try to change them. `` The general feeling of the government is that all humanitarian service groups in the country have sympathy for the rebels,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s partnership officer for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this week after 19 layworkers at the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> refugee center in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> were arrested. The country's only <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> pastor, the Rev. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrano </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurente </PERSON>, was arrested the next day, Monday. The human rights monitoring group <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Watch </PERSON> said Friday he was still in custody. As the Salvadoran Roman Catholic church has supported its poor parishioners, foreign priests, nuns, ministers, missionaries, doctors, nurses, social worker and teachers have joined them. Episcopal, Lutheran, Baptist and Mennonite churches were on the rosters of the dozens of churches, church schools, refuges and social offices raided by authorities during the rebel offensive. Americans, West Germans, Canadians, Spaniards and Guatemalans were among those detained or deported. Many _ both Salvadorans and foreigners _ have fled, many have gone into hiding in the past two weeks. But even so, they say the work of the churches is not over. `` They feel needed here. And the more they are persecuted, the more needed they feel,'' said an American academic with extensive experience in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s taste for the hard stuff has plummeted to its lowest level in three decades. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that per-capita consumption of distilled spirits in 1986 was 0.85 gallons, the lowest since 1959, when it was 0.84 gallons. `` The decline in spirits consumption may represent changes in the drinking patterns and preferences in the drinking-aged population,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report. `` These changes were reflected by greater interest in beverages with reduced alcohol content -LRB- light beers and wine coolers -RRB-, as well as increased public awareness regarding physical fitness, nutrition and alcohol abuse.'' Complete statistics were available through 1986. Preliminary statistics indicate the decline continued in 1987, to 0.83 gallons, said researcher <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON> of the Alcohol, <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said the drop in consumption of distilled spirits between 1985 and 1986 was the sharpest since 1956, as measured in both actual cases sold and the percentage of the decrease. But the exact statistics behind those conclusions were unavailable Friday. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said, per-capita consumption of ethanol _ the actual alcohol in alcoholic beverages _ was 2.58 gallons from all beverages in 1986, the lowest since 2.64 gallons in 1977. Two of three American adults drink, but a relatively small number of them account for most of the consumption of alcoholic beverages. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said 10 percent of drinkers, or just 6.5 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adult population, account for half of all the alcohol consumed in the nation. Public health officials defined heavy drinking as an average of one ounce or more of ethanol each day _ about two beers, cocktails or glasses of wine. Such drinkers, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said, run a seven-times greater risk of liver cirrhosis than occasional alcohol drinkers. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said at least 46 percent of the cirrhosis deaths among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> men and at least 15 percent of cirrhosis deaths among women are attributable to heavy drinking. The agency reported Friday that 26,151 Americans died of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis in 1986; 42 percent of those deaths were associated with alcohol. High rates of death from chronic liver disease were scattered across the country, topped by 31 such deaths per 100,000 residents in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lowest </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, with six deaths per 100,000 people. In another 13,475 deaths, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said, chronic liver disease was a `` contributing cause.''

 A policeman on trial for two deaths that sparked a race riot shot a motorcyclist in self-defense as he twisted to avoid being hit by the vehicle, the officer's partner testified. Officer <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Campell </PERSON> said she was only a few feet behind <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> the night of the Jan. 16 shooting. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, 31, is Hispanic and the two victims on the motorcycle were black. Prosecution witnesses had testified Ms. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> was on the sidewalk and ducked down behind their patrol car at the moment of the shooting. But on Friday she insisted she was in the middle of the street when she heard sirens, then spotted the motorcycle speeding toward <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> at about 70 mph with another police car in pursuit. `` I saw the motorcycle come into the southbound lane, heading straight for officer <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>,'' she testified. `` As the motorcycle got right up on him, I heard a ` pop,' and saw officer <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> give a twisting movement.'' She said the motorcycle passed within about a foot of <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, who twisted to escape being hit. Prosecutors claim the motorcyclist did not threaten <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>. The driver, <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23, died instantly with a bullet in his head. His passenger, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24, was critically injured when the out-of-control motorcycle crashed. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> died the next day. Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> asked if, despite departmental rules, Ms. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> had talked to <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> immediately after the incident. She denied discussing the case and said she did n't recall a conversation at the scene among her, <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, and a friend, officer <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> then showed photographs of the three officers apparently talking and making gestures just after the shooting. In one, <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> appeared to be standing in the position the defense says he occupied at the time of the shooting, but Ms. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> denied they were reenacting the scene. She and <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> were together, she said, because they had been ordered to find the spent shell casing. Prior to Ms. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>'s testimony, defense attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> called the trial a political ploy. `` There is more effort made to prosecute a police officer than any 10 murder cases I've ever seen in this court,'' he said. But lead prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> responded he would make no apology for the resources spent on the case. `` There is a large proportion of the people who live in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> who feel that they could be killed, perhaps for absolutely no reason because ... of the color of their skin,'' said <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>. `` -LRB- And -RRB- because of the occupation of their killer, that no justice will be done, that the justice system works only for the chosen few.''

<HEAD>Chic Shops Targeted in Nationwide Protests Against Fur</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Animal-rights activists marched past chic shops in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and at least a dozen cities in between to protest fur sales on the opening day of the holiday shopping season. The fur industry closely monitored protests on the fourth annual `` Fur-Free Friday.'' It vigorously rebutted charges of cruelty to animals and accused animal-rights activists of trying to deny consumers freedom of choice. The activists and industry officials also disputed whether the protests have succeeded in shaming shoppers not to buy fur. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, host of the game show `` The Price is Right,'' led 2,500 protesters in a march down <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Fifth Avenue, while about 150 demonstrators targeted 20 furriers in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>' ritzy shopping district In <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, protesters filled a black coffin with about $ 10,000 worth of mink, <ORGANIZATION> fox </ORGANIZATION>, and rabbit furs, splashed with red paint to symbolize blood. An organizer, the Rev. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Wessels </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said the furs once belonged to people who have since joined the animal-rights movement. `` I'd rather be naked than wear fur,'' read a message on a float that protesters wearing skin-colored leotards brought to a downtown <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> shopping mall. Four fur shops were vandalized in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Animals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nanci </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, blamed the vandalism on furriers trying to make the protest groups look bad About 50 people dressed in mourning black marched in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Union Square, in the heart of the downtown shopping district. `` Fur is torture, do n't buy fur,'' they chanted as they weaved through crowds of shoppers. Among other cities where anti-fur demonstrations took place were <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> Trans Species Unlimited, an animal rights group, said protests were scheduled in dozens of other cities. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> led a four-block-long line of protesters. <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, who resigned as host of the Miss USA pageant over its award of a fur to the winner, called the nation's fur farms `` animal concentration camps.'' The charge infuriated a spokesman for the fur industry. `` That kind of spurious allegation is entirely without any basis in fact,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckler </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Fur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>. `` The fact is animals raised on American fur farms receive the highest standards of care of any farm animals in the world.'' <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> DeHart </PERSON>, president of the coalition, said `` Fur-Free Friday'' is `` simply a media ploy designed to draw attention away from the determination of animal rights groups to eliminate all animal use.'' It was hard to gauge the effect of the protests on business, but most shop owners dismissed the protests as merely annoying. `` We have had very good sales at this time of year, as usual, so I do n't believe it has changed at all,'' said <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Rosina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Malta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fashions </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, where the front door was painted red by vandals. In <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, where about 250 protesters targeted five fur stores in the posh <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> district, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Duxbury </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> asserted that such protests have cost the fur industry 30 percent of its market. <LOCATION> Duxbury </LOCATION> also said five Denver-area furriers have gone out of business in the past year. But the <ORGANIZATION> Fur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> said fur sales have tripled in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the past decade, to more than $ 1 billion last year. The fur council monitored the demonstrations from its office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, the executive director. In some cities, protesters met counterdemonstrations. While 35 protesters gathered at a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> shopping center, half a dozen fur store workers and mink farm owners were nearby, holding signs proclaiming the right to wear fur. In <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, about 80 people who picketed fur shops were challenged by the Rev. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and about eight members of his Baptist church. `` Human rights over animal rights,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> shouted to the anti-fur demonstrators. `` Take off your leather shoes if you do n't want to kill animals.

<HEAD>Machinists Say They'll Escalate Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> management and its Machinists union agree on one thing _ the abrupt end of sympathy strikes by the pilots and flight attendants wo n't immediately change the airline's status. In anything, troubles were likely to be compounded for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which said Friday it had no jobs to offer the returning pilots and attendants. The Machinists vowed to continue and intensify their 8 -LCB- - month strike despite the end of the sympathy walkouts `` It really does n't affect our operation at all,'' company spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said. `` Now we have to deal with the issue of bringing people back to work if there are openings.'' The airline asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> to determine the status of all employees: those hired during the strike, union members who crossed picket lines and returning strikers. `` We want to take care of that up front so everyone knows clearly where they stand,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said. A statement from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> local said the other unions' action `` does not have a material effect on the strike and on -LRB- Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s failed reorganization plan. It does not change the reality of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s performance and the problems it faces in a poor industry environment.'' `` We're going to escalate the strike,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortis </PERSON>, president of Machinists Local 702. `` They're losing $ 2 million to $ 3 million a day. We know they ca n't survive without maintenance.'' The company is in disagreement with the pilots and flight attendants unions on recalling former strikers, and <PERSON> Ortis </PERSON> noted recent reports that cash-strapped <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has resumed negotiations to sell its <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> routes to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Eastern filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws five days after the strike began March 4. `` What are they going to do with those people if they sell <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Ortis </PERSON> said. He said hundreds of pilots and flight attendants jobs are tied to those routes and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would face more legal fights about employees laid off after a sale. Although Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said Eastern was in solid shape on maintenance, Machinists officials said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s records declined last month in on-time performance and customer complaints. According to <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures released earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s on-time performance fell to 80.6 percent in September from 86.9 percent in August. Customer complaints fell to 7.93 per 100,000 passengers from 36.24 in August, but the figures for both months were above the average of 5.77 per 100,000 passengers for the period from January to September. Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has openings for 500 mechanics, with 2,500 on the current workforce including 300 Machinists who crossed picket lines. She said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has 1,700 union flight attendants who crossed picket lines, and has hired 1,700 new flight attendants with another 250 recruits in training. That gives the rebuilding carrier all it needs, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said Eastern has 1,850 pilots, including 850 union pilots who crossed picket lines and 1,000 new hirees, enough for its schedule of 775 daily flights, which is scheduled to expand gradually to more than 900 in early 1990. The returning strikers go on a recall list and will be called back as openings come up, Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said. Eastern officials have said seniority is less important than the pilots' qualifications for specific planes and routes.

<TEXT>
 A human rights group has blamed both the right-wing government and leftist insurgents for killing civilians during an 11-day rebel offensive. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Watch, in a report released Friday, said the armed forces `` engaged in targeted killings, arbitrary detentions of non-combatants and torture.'' The group also criticized rebels `` for using civilians as shields.'' The report, called `` Carnage Again,'' said the air force `` as far as it is possible to determine, caused great loss of civilian life by indiscriminate aerial attacks in slum neighborhoods.'' During the fighting, the air force attacked some neighborhoods around the capital, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, in an effort to dislodge rebels who took up positions there. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Watch criticized both sides for `` impeding medical care for the wounded'' who could not be evacuated because of the heavy combat. The New York-based group also said the offensive led to non-combat human rights violations by the military as `` government forces apparently took advantage of the fighting to settle old scores.'' It cited the massacre of six Jesuits, a series of raids on churches and church-run shelters, death threats against church officials, and the arrests and expulsions of foreign church workers. The report also raised questions about the government's investigation of the killings last week of the Jesuits at a church-run univerisity The report said President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> should have been able to determine what all government forces in the area did that night. Though <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> has condemned the killings, witnesses have reportedly said the Jesuits were killed by forces in military uniforms. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Friday that a witness to the massacre has left the country. The witness left with the help of the governments of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said embassy spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. The head of the Jesuit order in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Tojeira </PERSON>, identified the witness as <PERSON> Lucia </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerna </PERSON>. Officials said she had been staying in the Spanish Embassy since the killings. Attorney General <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Colorado </PERSON> quoted the woman, who had worked as a housekeeper at university, as saying she saw men `` dressed in military uniforms'' killing the Jesuits, their housekeeper and her daughter. Jesuit officials said the woman left Thursday for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Also Friday, legislators debated a proposed law that would impose long prison terms for protests and other activities by peasant, human-rights and union groups. The government and military consider most such organizations to be fronts for leftist rebels. Under the proposal, participants in sit-ins or building takeovers could face up to 20 years in prison. People blocking traffic with demonstrations could be jailed for five years.

 Authorities are investigating the giant chemical company <ORGANIZATION> Bayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> on suspicion that it illegally sold a pesticides plant to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, company officials said. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has been rocked by several export scandals in the past year.

<TEXT>
 A woman who witnessed the massacre of six Jesuit priests in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> last was spirited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by Spanish, French and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats and is under guard here at a secret location. The witness was flown Thursday night to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> aboard a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> military plane with the assistance of a key French official, the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. She has been identified as <PERSON> Lucia </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerna </PERSON>, 40, a cleaning woman who worked for two of the slain priests at <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simeon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. According to unidentified officials cited by the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, the woman saw the priests and two university employees shot at point-blank range on Nov. 16 by a group of 30 to 40 men wearing Salvadoran military uniforms. Her account appeared to bolster charges by church officials and others that the killings were carried out by members of the Salvadoran military. Salvadoran officials have claimed the killings could have been the work of leftists trying to pass themselves off as Salvadoran soldiers. The witness also was interviewed by <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> officials, and Salvadoran Attorney General <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Colorado </PERSON> was quoted in the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> as saying the witness saw just five assasins _ three dressed in black and two in olive-green uniforms. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouchner </PERSON>, the French minister for humanitarian affairs, said he escorted the woman, her husband and their daughter to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kouchner </PERSON> said the family has been handed over to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for protection. But other, unidentified officials involved in the case said the witness and her family were being guarded by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. A spokeswoman at the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> refused to confirm or deny the report. <PERSON> Kouchner </PERSON> said he was in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> last weekend to attend the funerals of the priests, and learned Wednesday the witness and her family were in the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> and wanted to go to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` Inside Salvador it was impossible to protect them,'' <PERSON> Kouchner </PERSON> said. `` There were death squadrons all around.'' <PERSON> Kouchner </PERSON> said he offered <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s assistance in bringing the family to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, and was joined on the trip by two unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats, and bodyguards. `` We transferred the lady -LRB- to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s airport -RRB- under the protection of our bodyguards and security people from the French and Spanish embassies,'' <PERSON> Kouchner </PERSON> said, adding that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, was present. Salvadoran President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> approved of the witness' relocation to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kouchner </PERSON> said Meanwhile, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> priest who fled <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> last week after receiving death threats said he planned to carry out a campaign to end <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s rightist government. The Rev. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>, visiting <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, this week, said that during heavy fighting in the Salvadoran capital last week he called friends in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to say that the government was hurting civilians by bombing and strafing of poor neighborhoods where leftist rebels were entrenched. <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> said he then received a telephoned death threat at the residence for <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and Lutheran clerics where he lived, and decided to leave the country. Many clergy in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> have been threatened by rightists since the guerrilla offensive began two weeks ago. Many priests are in hiding. Church members often are accused of sheltering or supplying the rebels.

<HEAD>Jury Awards Indiana Boy $67,000 For Foul Ball Injury</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A jury has ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> to pay $ 67,500 in damages to a boy who was struck in the eye by a foul ball during a game at <LOCATION> Wrigley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, attorneys said. The award to <PERSON> Delbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 16, is only the second of its kind in the country, <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cremer </PERSON> said. In the other case, a lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astros </ORGANIZATION>, the verdict was reversed on appeal, and <PERSON> Cremer </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> would appeal. Contacted Friday night at the family's <LOCATION> Valparaiso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, home, the boy's father, <PERSON> Delbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, said, `` We're pretty happy ... because maybe the <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> will do something to protect the fans now.'' The younger <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> was struck in the face by a foul ball off the bat of <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> slugger <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Durham </PERSON> during an Aug. 20, 1983, game against <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. He was sitting in a box seat on the third base side of home plate just a few feet from the protective screen. The boy was treated at a ballpark first aid station and taken by ambulance to a children's hospital, where he spent five days. He suffered a fractured eye socket which caused double vision, and required an eye operation a month later, said his lawyer, <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cirignani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cirignani </PERSON> had contended that the protective screen behind home plate should have been extended further. He said a <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury on Wednesday awarded <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> $ 67,500 for his pain and suffering. But <PERSON> Cremer </PERSON> said, `` I think there is an excellent chance of getting it reversed.'' `` If the verdict is upheld, what do the Cubs do?'' <PERSON> Cremer </PERSON> asked. `` Do they then screen the entire park to protect themselves against liability? Catching foul balls is as much a part of baseball as crackerjacks and peanuts.''

 A 24-mile-long oil slick off southern <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> has coated several beaches and oiled at least 50 birds, most of which were expected to die, authorities said.

More skimming efforts were scheduled today. <PERSON> Hendry </PERSON> estimated the slick, first noticed Thursday, involved 550 to 1,100 gallons of Bunker C fuel oil of the type used to power deep sea ships. He suspected it came from a tanker or another ship's waste-oil tank.

 About 45 businesses displaced by the Oct. 17 earthquake reopened in temporary quarters _ seven huge tents erected just in time to attract holiday shoppers. `` We love <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> and this is part of our life,'' said <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagnall </PERSON>, a shopper in the tent pavilion, which was erected on the site of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION>, devastated in the 7.1-magnitude quake. `` We just felt we must support <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> and see it come out of the rubble and live again.''

<TEXT>
 A week ago, the editor of a Czech-language newspaper published in this tiny, central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town predicted in a column that change would soon come to his homeland. But <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaculik </PERSON>, who left <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> a month after the Soviet invasion in 1968, was stunned when the hard-line members of the Czechoslovak Politburo resigned Friday. `` I did n't expect such change so rapidly,'' <PERSON> Vaculik </PERSON> said. `` I'm excited at least that these guys are gone I always feared that they may turn violent against the people.'' <PERSON> Vaculik </PERSON>, 44, publishes the monthly <PERSON> Hospodar </PERSON> for 1,000 subscribers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 1,000 in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, he said. Most of the paper's readers are older and remember the `` dream of the <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>,'' the only independent Czechoslovakian republic, from 1918 to 1938. `` They know there is a different way,'' <PERSON> Vaculik </PERSON> said. About 85 percent of West's 2,300 residents are of Czechoslovak descent, <PERSON> Vaculik </PERSON> said, but only a handful were born in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Good farming conditions and cheap land brought most of them to West in the 1870s. The town's 22-member dance ensemble toured <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> last year. `` It was really a culture shock. Things that we have at our fingertips they're not able to have,'' said <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Grmela </PERSON>, who started the dance group with her husband 14 years ago. `` We're pleased to see what's happening now. In <PERSON> Granger </PERSON>, a town about 80 miles south of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> that is also predominantly Czech, residents are also watching events in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> closely. Both towns are in central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. `` It looks like they might finally get some freedom, but it's hard to judge,'' said <PERSON> Jannine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lalla </PERSON>, who visited <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> 11 years ago `` They're a complicated outfit over there. The people are so nice, but they are afraid.'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrabel </PERSON> of <PERSON> Granger </PERSON> publishes Nasinec, a 75-year old Czech-language weekly newspaper, but has never been able to sell the paper in <LOCATION> Czechslovakia </LOCATION>. He hopes the changes pro-democracy demonstrators seek will enable him to do so. `` I never thought it would be free there again,'' he said.

<HEAD>East German Leaders Hits Streets in New Appeal for Support</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 As the East German capital emptied today for a third weekend of visits to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, Communist leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> took his appeal for public trust to the streets of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, a hub of recent protests. On Friday, other leading Communists said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> should consider stronger ties with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to rescue this country's troubled economy During his stroll through the center of the grimy industrial city of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> was besieged by shoppers and workers who pounded him with questions about the nation's future, the official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. `` Can the desperate situation with the economy be improved? ... Will those responsible for the misery be punished?'' residents asked <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. They offered `` question after question, but also encouragements,'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said, quoting strollers as yelling: `` Egon, keep it up! We wish you health!'' Protests in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, a weekly ritual, have attracted hundreds of thousands of people. The demonstrations there and elsewhere in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, coupled with an exodus to the West through other <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries, prompted <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to open its borders to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> earlier this month. The generally positive report on <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s visit appeared aimed at boosting the leader's image at a time of disillusionment with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> stalwarts. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> reportedly faces strong opposition to his continued leadership within the party, which is split on how to proceed with reforms. He has admitted he could be replaced at a major party meeting next month. In another move aimed at winning public confidence, Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> <PERSON> Maleuda </PERSON> said in an interview published by the youth newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Junge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> that parliamentary elections could come as early as autumn 1990 if a new election law can be worked out early next year. He did not indicate the vote would be truly democratic, as other top officials have. However, he said he could envision participation by groups other than the current established parties aligned with the Communists. The rush for the borders began early, with more than 300,000 crossing into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> before nightfall Friday, and hundreds of thousands more traveling through the night. Trabant and <ORGANIZATION> Wartburg </ORGANIZATION> cars backed up as far as 25 miles at border crossings into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> state, and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Potsdamer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platz </LOCATION> crossing in the Wall for pedestrians was packed by thousands before noon East German public transportion was so overwhelmed with the westward travelers that the federal <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued an appeal to citizens late Friday to avoid using the rail system. Most of the East Germans were just headed for visits, mostly to shop. However, a new surge of East German refugees also has become apparent over the past few days, with more than 3,000 applying for resettlement in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Thursday and Friday. Also today, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Eberlein </PERSON>, a member of the ruling Politburo and head of the party's disciplinary committee, called for a thorough probe of `` misuse of office, corruption, personal enrichment and other guilts.'' He did not say exactly who he was referring to. But the party has already launched an investigation into the actions of former party chief <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and other top officials of the ousted leadership.

 The holiday shopping season is officially open and retailers hope the huge crowds that packed stores on the traditional kickoff day after Thanksgiving are a prelude to a merry and profitable Christmas. `` Nobody's anticipating a banner year,'' said <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> store in <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> `` But we're hoping to do as well as last year and maybe a little better.'' As the peak holiday selling season began Friday, many merchants tried to accommodate shoppers with longer hours, bargains and special services on a day that usually is the busiest of the year for retailers. But there were some indications buyers were bingeing less than retailers hoped. Thousands stopped by the 59-store <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Clovis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, but mall manager <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON> said, `` We're finding that people are waiting longer to do their shopping. `` The last Saturday prior to Christmas is the day that really seems to be the most lucrative,'' <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON> said. Almost half of retailers' annual business is done in the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Usually shoppers swarm stores in the days immediately after Thanksgiving and then lose interest until the final, frantic days just before Christmas. This year's retail outlook varies by region but nationwide retail sales are expected to rise only about an average of 5.5 percent over last year, compared with 1988's surprisingly strong 9 percent gain. Retailers and industry analysts say holiday shoppers are likely to continue holding back generally on purchases of expensive, long-lasting goods, such as home appliances, as they have all year. Store workers said consumer electronics and video games appeared to be selling fast on Friday. Clothing, costume jewelry and accessories also did well. `` Nintendo is selling awful good and camcorders are blowing out. Anything in the electric -LRB- department -RRB- is selling very well,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> store at <LOCATION> Merle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Markdowns on merchandise at some troubled stores appealed to bargain hunters. The six <ORGANIZATION> B. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Altman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> department stores in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> drew hordes to the chain's going-out-of-business sale Only <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> store will remain open after its financially ailing parent <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> could n't find a buyer. The morning crowd clamoring to get into <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>'s main store in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> was so heavy that shoppers were admitted in shifts. By midafternoon, police turned people away, saying the enormous store was dangerously overcrowded. `` It's like a war zone,'' said <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavine </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, who battled the bedlam to buy a designer suit. Elsewhere, shoppers who showed up early got special treatment. The <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> store in Terre Haute, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. offered extra low prices on selected items from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. During a 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. sale at <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>'s, a discount store about 20 miles south of downtown <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, shoppers drank free coffee, sipped apple cider and munched on doughnuts. Some malls offered other amenities. Shoppers at <ORGANIZATION> Grossmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> could leave their youngsters at a free child-care center and take beepers in case of an emergency. The Somerset mall in <LOCATION> Troy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Emporium-Capwell </PERSON>'s outside <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, offered valet parking to ease clogged lots.

<TEXT>
 New President <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> today chose a Moslem leader as the new prime minister and formally disbanded the military government of Christian Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, a 64-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker, was elected by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Friday as <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 10th president. He succeeds <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, who was assassinated Wednesday by a car bomb in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and buried today. `` The peace march has started and it will not stumble,'' <PERSON> Hwari </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Friday as it met in this Bekaa valley city guarded by hundreds of Syrian troops. `` We shall not allow anyone to stand in the way.'' <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s decree ousting <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s three-man military cabinet is a formality. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> still controls the 20,000-member army, has denounced <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s election, and claims that his military cabinet is <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s only legitimate government. In <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Zahleh </LOCATION> in the eastern <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> valley </LOCATION>, residents fired guns into the air to celebrate his selection. Hundreds danced in the streets. In contrast, church bells tolled and an army band played dirges in the northern mountain town of <LOCATION> Zgorta </LOCATION> during the funeral of <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION>, whom <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> described in his acceptance speech as `` the martyr of national unity.'' Patriarch <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>, spiritual leader of the Maronite community, led the funeral services, and Papal <PERSON> Nuncio </PERSON> <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pointe </PERSON> read a message from Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II in which the pontiff said he was praying for peace in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Women wailed as the coffins of <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION> and six slain bodyguards were carried out of the cathedral of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> the Baptist for burial in a cemetery nearby. Mothers, sisters and wives of the slain bodyguards flung themselves on the caskets as they were lowered into the graves. Christians and Moslems nationwide joined in a strike in tribute of the fallen president. Like Mouawad, <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> chose Sunni Moslem leader <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> to head a new government comprised of Christians and Moslems under an Arab League peace accord aimed at ending <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, 54, a Maronite like <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, opposes the peace accord because it has no deadline for the withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian soldiers from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> was named to head an interim cabinet by former President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> on Sept. 22, 1988, just before <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s six-year term expired with <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> unable to elect a successor. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s appointment was rejected by Moslems, and resulted in the emergence of two rival cabinets vying for power. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> headed the Moslem cabinet. The ensuing political crisis renewed fighting between Moslem militias and their <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> allies and hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces led by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> today announced a cabinet that he said he had chosen as prime minister-designate under <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, 60, retained Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> as public works minister and Shiite Moslem militia chieftain <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> as minister of elecrical and hydraulic resources. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> also got the housing and cooperatives portfolios. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> are <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main allies in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They fielded the largest Moslem militias in the civil war against the Christians. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> also appointed <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, leader of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s largest <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> political force, into the new government as minister of post and telecomunications. But <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> living in the Christian enclave controlled by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s army, appeared reluctant to take up the post. `` I was surprised by my appointment. I do n't oppose the new government, but the question of my participation must first be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> politburo,'' <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON> said in a statement broadcast by the party's <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> radio station. In addition to the Maronite, Sunni, <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> and Druse communities, the Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholics and Armenians also were represented in <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' government. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who vehemently opposed <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>'s election, said <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s election was `` as unconstitutional as that of <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION> Both have been elected under Syrian occupation.'' `` They should have waited to find out who killed Mouawad before appointing a new president,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said in a statement released by his press office in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s eastern suburb of <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes today blasted a guerrilla base of a radical Palestinian faction near <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> army lines in southeast <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. At least two group members were wounded, police said. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, an army spokesman confirmed the air attack on <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaaqoub </PERSON>, the second on the village in three days. The jets returned safely to base. The spokesman, who can not be identified under standing rules, said the strike was aimed at `` terrorist targets related to <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> is a former Syrian army captain who heads the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. A Lebanese police spokesman confirmed that the target was a Popular Front base. There were no immediate reports of fatalities. The police spokesman said two fighter-bombers fired six rockets into the base in <LOCATION> Sultan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yaaqoub </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, in two late morning runs. The spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said the planes also dropped about six time bombs that exploded in a 10-minute period after the air attack. Syrian soldiers manning surface-to-air missile batteries in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> did not fire at the raiding jets, the spokesman said. Witnesses said guerrilla defenders fired on the attacking jets with twin-barreled, anti-aircraft guns, but no hits were observed. They said smoke billowed from a one-story building at the base seconds after rockets crashed into it. The air raids today and Thursday were seen as a warning to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to prevent its guerrilla allies from taking advantage of the current political turmoil in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to stage attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Both raids followed the assassination of Lebanese President <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>. Today's bombing came hours after the election of a presidential successor, <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> also backed by the Syrians. On Thursday, four Israeli F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers struck bases of the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in Sultan <PERSON> Yaaqoub </PERSON> and the adjacent <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanoun </PERSON> in a 10-minute attack. One fighter was killed and four were wounded. The pro-Iranian fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, also has bases in the area. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is the umbrella group for <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> Moslem factions holding 18 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including eight Americans. Today's raid was <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 16th attack on targets in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. By police count, the raids have killed 18 people and wounded 109. The Popular Front is opposed to peace overtures by <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>.

 Campaign workers fought pitched battles in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s biggest city today, and the <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> announced there was evidence of vote rigging in Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s district. A respected weekly released a poll saying <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s party will be `` hard pressed'' to win 200 seats in the 543-seat <LOCATION> Lok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sabha </LOCATION>, or House of the People, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s decision-making lower chamber which will choose the prime minister. The poll in Sunday magazine interviewed 11,500 voters. In another development, opposition leader <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, considered the top choice to replace <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, said he was reluctant to become prime minister should his five-party opposition coalition win. `` It is political suicide to depend too much on an individual,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` So I have decided not to accept any proposal to become the prime minister.'' Violence continued today when campaign workers in <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>, battled with bombs and bricks. One election official was killed and dozens were injured. Police fired into the air and used tear gas to disperse the crowds. Two other people were killed in campaign-related violance, one in southern Andhra Pradesh and the other in southern <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION>. So far 97 people have died since voting began Wednesday. The elections, which end Sunday and will determine whether <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> remains in power or falls victim to a newly energized and united opposition, are shaping up as the most violent in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s history At least 141 people have been killed since the election was announced in mid-October, surpassing the 38 people who died during the December 1984 election that propelled <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> to power two months after the assassination of his mother, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. Voting will take place Sunday in tiny <LOCATION> Sikkim </LOCATION>, the northern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> where Sikh separatists have killed more than 1,650 people this year, and in eastern <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> state where violence between Hindus and Moslems has left at least 300 people dead in the past six weeks. First election results are expected Sunday night after the polls close. Since the voting started, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION> have traded charges of voter intimidation and ballot fraud. Chief Election Commissioner R.V.S. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> <PERSON> Sastri </PERSON> said an investigation in <LOCATION> Gandhi </LOCATION>'s district has found evidence of vote rigging in 50 percent of the polling places it checked. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has denied it was responsible for rigging in <LOCATION> Amethi </LOCATION>, the constituency where <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> is seeking re-election. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> <PERSON> Sastri </PERSON> said he hoped a decision would be made on a revote in the <LOCATION> Amethi </LOCATION> district Sunday when counting is supposed to begin. Revoting has already been ordered in 930 of the country's 590,000 polling places because of ballot fraud <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> <PERSON> Sastri </PERSON>'s dramatic news conference began when 40 Indian reporters barged into his office. Soon afterward he received a telephone call from an <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> investigator who had been sent to <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s district to investigate allegations of vote fraud. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> <PERSON> Sastri </PERSON> allowed reporters to stay in the room as he spoke with the investigator, C.L. Rose. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> visited 35 polling stations in 10 villages and reported rigging in 50 percent of them, <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> <PERSON> Sastri </PERSON> said. Villagers issued `` angry and grievious complaints against the voting,'' <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> <PERSON> Sastri </PERSON> said. He said the decision on <LOCATION> Amethi </LOCATION> was a serious one. `` Here is an allegation which will damage not merely an individual but an institution, the institution is the prime ministership,'' he said. He said his decision would not just effect the district but the `` whole country as well.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has been accused of large-scale rigging in <LOCATION> Amethi </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Police today questioned 10 passengers about a bomb found aboard a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> jumbo jet carrying 339 people. The bomb failed to go off, and the plane returned to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> safely. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 was traveling from <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. Saudi Arabian Airlines Flight 367 was flying over the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> when it was ordered to land in the southern port city of <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> because of an extortion threat. While the plane was airborne, officials said airport security in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> received an anonymous letter threatening to blow the plane up unless a demand for $ 15 million was met. In <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the airline today issued a statement saying that `` with God's blessing,'' a bomb found in a piece of unclaimed luggage failed to go off, sparing the lives of the 332 adults and seven children aboard. Eight ounces of dynamite were found in the unclaimed bag, said <PERSON> Moinuddin </PERSON>, the head of a bomb squad. The dynamite was surrounded by clothes, a cigarette lighter and a box of matches, said <PERSON> Moinuddin </PERSON>, who only uses one name. Earlier police reports called the device a time bomb and said only a loose battery wire prevented it from exploding. Police gave few details about the 10 passengers held for questioning. `` We have n't laid any charges; we are just questioning them,'' said a <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> police official on condition of anonymity. He said all 10 were from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s North West Frontier Province. <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> police said they also were questioning a taxi driver who delivered the extortion letter to an <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> airport officer shortly after Flight 367 left <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. The note demanded $ 15 million in ransom to be deposited in three bags at a location in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, said the Saudi airline. Pakistani police earlier put the figure at $ 1.5 million. No one has claimed responsibility for placing the bomb on the plane, and police have refused to discuss possible suspects. A terrorist bomb exploded aboard a New York-bound <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 people on the ground. Investigators in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> later determined that the explosion was caused by a bomb hidden in a cassette-recorder.

<HEAD>Hundreds of Vietnamese Battle at Detention Center; Police Fire Tear

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police today fired tear gas into a refugee camp to break up a battle between hundreds of Vietnamese boat people armed with stones and spears, officials said. At least five people were injured. The fight between rival groups from two different provinces in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> broke out after a man was attacked, police said. The Vietnamese tore down a 17-foot-tall fence that separated the two groups at the <LOCATION> Shek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> center. Police reported four Vietnamese were injured, including a man who was hospitalized in fair condition with stab wounds to the chest. A police officer was also slightly injured but required no hospital treatment. Besides using stones and spears, the boat people also fought with water pipes and sharpened iron rods before police dispersed them, officials said. There have been frequent fights in recent months among Vietnamese boat people held in detention camps in this small British colony. More than 55,000 Vietnamese refugees are languishing in the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> camps, hoping for resettlement and fearing forced repatriation to their Communist-ruled homeland. It is expected that tens of thousands of boat people will be denied refugee status by <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, and tension has increased in the camps with the possibility that they will be sent back to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. On Friday, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said his country has `` little choice'' except compulsory repatriation for the boat people, who are putting an `` intolerable strain on <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s patience and resources.'' At a Camp David meeting Friday, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> criticized <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> for the plan to force the boat people back to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> made no comment on the criticism when she returned to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> today, but a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON>, said: `` What are we supposed to do? They can not just sit there in those camps getting cholera. We have to do something. I do not know what else there is to do. Everyone shares the anxiety. `` We have tried to persuade the international community to take them. The international community will not take them _ not <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, not <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, not <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, not anybody.''

<HEAD>Make-Believe Virginia Town May Be Crime Capital of World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>QUANTICO, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The real crime capital of the world may be a small town nestled in a rural <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> forest where bank robberies, kidnappings and deadly extortion plots are running rampant. The town's mayor, however, shrugs it off with a serene smile. After all, as the interminable struggle between good and evil rages outside his office window, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pledger </PERSON> boasts a police force that would be the envy of any big-city mayor _ dozens of smart, square-jawed young <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> trainees. <PERSON> Pledger </PERSON> is mayor of `` <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>,'' a fictitious but strikingly realistic town built on a wooded, 20-acre site at the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, about 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION><LOCATION> , </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, where students practice nabbing criminals, interrogating witnesses and gathering evidence. `` This is the most crime-ridden town in the world,'' says <PERSON> Pledger </PERSON>, the training unit chief in charge of <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>'s Alley. `` But the great thing is that our law enforcement people have a 100 percent success rate solving crimes.'' At first glance, the town is picture-book <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, with its own post office, drugstore, bank, barber shop, combination pool hall and Greyhound bus station, coin-operated laundry, movie theater, motel and boarding houses. All are phony except for the Pastime Bar, where <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> employees can step inside for a cup of coffee or a sandwich while waiting for the next crime wave. Visitors with long memories might notice something familiar about the movie theater, the Biograph, which features <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> and <PERSON> Myrna </PERSON> <PERSON> Loy </PERSON> in `` <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Melodrama </LOCATION>.'' It was under the same marquee of the Biograph Theater in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that gangster <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillinger </PERSON> was shot dead in 1934. In this town, there are no mothers pushing baby carriages or merchants hurrying to work. The streets are strangely empty until the silence is broken by volleys from blank-firing shotguns and revolvers, the squealing tires of police cruisers and shouts of `` Freeze! This is the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>!'' The make-believe bad guys and witnesses who inhabit <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Alley </LOCATION> are amateur `` role players'' hired by the hour through a commercial talent agency They include housewives from the neighboring <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Quantico </LOCATION>, schoolteachers, retirees and off-duty firefighters and police officers. None has any previous acting experience. `` In this town, crime pays _ at $ 8 an hour,'' says <PERSON> Pledger </PERSON>. A huge sign on the outskirts of town gives visitors fair warning: `` Welcome to <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>'s Alley. City Limits. Caution: Law enforcement training exercises in progress. Display of weapons, firing of blank ammunition and arrests may occur. If challenged, please follow instructions. Have a nice day.'' Last Wednesday, the day started literally with a bang at 8:20 a.m. when the <ORGANIZATION> Hogan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> was robbed. Three gunmen fled with about $ 30,000 in play money, some of it in $ 50 bills bearing <PERSON> Pledger </PERSON>'s portrait Four teams of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> trainees _ 44 in all _ sprang into action, following a minute-by-minute script written by their supervisors. While the first team was interviewing bank employees and dusting the teller's cage for fingerprints, other trainees quickly arrested the first suspect, a shaggy-haired man in plaid shirt and jeans, at his hideout in the Dogwood Inn motel. Another gunman was grabbed, handcuffed and frisked outside his three-story townhouse while his girlfriend loudly complained and a nosy neighbor gawked. The third suspect, who lives in the local trailer park, was caught in an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> ambush at <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s Garage, where he had left his aging green sedan for repairs.

 Hundreds of monkeys descended from their <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temple home Saturday for a 12-course meal complete with menus and linen napkins but forgot their manners and hurled soda cans at the curious humans. The furry guests leaped aboard the neat rows of tables to devour vast spreads of sweet and sour noodles, salad, tomato cocktail, fried rice, Chinese-style noodles, potato soup, banana cake and coconut candy. A local hotel owner, <PERSON> Yongyut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiwattanananusan </PERSON>, gave the monkeys the meal to thank them for the success of his <ORGANIZATION> Lopburi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION>. The monkeys are symbols of good fortune and a favorite tourist attraction in this small provincial capital 70 miles north of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. The monkeys dined on the grounds of the Wat <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prakhan </LOCATION> in the morning, and a second feast was given in the afternoon at the 10th-century Three Pagodas Temple. At Wat <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prakhan </LOCATION>, they feasted with abandon despite attempts by an army of waiters to keep order. At one stage, some swung up into the trees and hurled soft drink cans at hundreds of human spectators. The second feast was held before much larger crowds of people. It fizzled out as a monkey named <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> led his fellows in a tactical retreat, leaving untouched more than 40 tables of food. Townspeople said the monkeys sleep at the Wat <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prakhan </LOCATION> and cross the road at exactly 8 a.m. each morning for breakfast at the Three Pagodas Temple. They believe the monkeys are the disciples of the four-handed Hindu-Buddhist idol around which the Wat <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prakhan </LOCATION> was built.

 One of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' closest allies has slipped back into the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> three years after President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who is also his cousin, banished him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON> was welcomed as `` the leading light of the opposition'' by those opposed to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, but he said after his return late Friday that he came back mainly to defend himself against charges he helped <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> steal from the government. <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON>, 54, left the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in February 1986 aboard the same American military plane that carried <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> into exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> after his ouster in an uprising that brought Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> died Sept. 28. Assistant presidential spokeswoman <PERSON> Lourdes </PERSON> <PERSON> Sytangco </PERSON> said manifests of flights from abroad did not include an <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON> and he may have traveled under an assumed name from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A presidential security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> learned of <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON>'s arrival from airport officials Saturday. <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON>, who is a first cousin to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, said he wanted to return to clear his name of allegations he helped <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> loot the Philippine treasury of billions of dollars. The Aquino administration seized <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON>'s assets and has named him as a defendant in 29 civil suits. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcuna </PERSON> said criminal charges were also being prepared. `` I am thankful that we have been able to come home because for a long time I have wanted to come back here,'' <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON> said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> DZRH </ORGANIZATION> radio. `` And I thank the almighty that I have been given the opportunity to return to my beloved motherland.'' <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON> told a group of reporters Saturday that his defense counsel advised him to return home to make it easier to prepare his defense. <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON> said he was issued a passport by the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Azcuna </PERSON> said the palace was unaware any passport was issued. <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON>'s passport was canceled in 1986, along with those of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his immediate family. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> banned the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family from returning and refused to allow her predecessor' body to be buried in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, citing national security. Rep. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Albano </PERSON>, former minority leader in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON>'s return would boost the opposition forces, still grasping for a leader since <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' death. `` If he will accept it, we will wholeheartedly give the opposition leadership to him,'' <PERSON> Albano </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON>. `` We welcome him as the leading light of the opposition.'' But <PERSON> Nicanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Yniguez </PERSON>, leader of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON> apparently wanted to devote his time to clearing his name and if he wanted to stay out of politics `` we respect his decision.'' Others seeking support from <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> followers include Vice President <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>. Both are seen as possible contendors for the presidency in 1992. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> says she will not seek re-election. During the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON> was described as the second-most powerful figure in the national economy after the president himself. <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON> was variously chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miguel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest food and beverage company; the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coconut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>; and head of the state monopoly for exporting coconuts.

 Nearly a year after <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 blew up, investigators hunting the bombers struggle with an international web of evidence, theory and tales of political intrigue. Theories abound. Some conflict, others interlock. Proving any of them is another matter. Terrorism experts and media investigations have pointed to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. Theories are that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hired the organization to avenge a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship's July 1988 downing of an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jet with 290 people aboard. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has denied any involvement. Flight 103 of Dec. 21 was an ordinary flight full of ordinary people: students going home for Christmas; GIs taking infants to meet their grandparents; a newly engaged couple, a pilot's wife, a Peace Corps volunteer. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 blew up over the Scottish town of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground. The <LOCATION> Dumfries </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON> <PERSON> Constabulary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>'s regional police force, still heads the investigation. Eighty officers are assigned to the investigation, which has stretched to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>. Inspector <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McCullough </PERSON> said 85 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 has been recovered, along with 16,000 pieces of belongings that were on board. `` We are making satisfactory progress with the investigation,'' <PERSON> McCullough </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our progress to date certainly makes us optimistic that there will be a satisfactory conclusion.'' Police wo n't say more. There are reports of friction between the British and West German police. The two forces do n't even agree publicly about whether the bomb was planted in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> or elsewhere. It is a key question, and the answer will help fix the blame for the security lapse that allowed the bomb aboard. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, the Lord Advocate, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s senior law officer, recently appealed to the news media to exercise restraint in their reporting lest they `` seriously jeopardize the international criminal investigation and any future court proceedings.'' What is officially on record is that the bomb was made of a plastic explosive packed in a <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> radio-cassette player, and hidden in a suitcase that was loaded into a forward cargo hold. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s transport secretary at the time, said it was probably Semtex, the colorless, odorless, putty-like explosive made in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Deputy Chief Constable <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said the `` balance of probabilities'' pointed to the bomb being loaded on a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, where Flight 103 originated. Passengers and baggage continuing on to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> were transferred to the larger plane at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, and the hold where the bomb exploded contained mostly baggage loaded in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and a small amount of interline baggage, <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said. West German police maintain there's not enough evidence to prove the bomb was put on board in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor who studies terrorism, said the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a radical Palestinian group based in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, fits the bombmakers' profile. `` They have the expertise, they have a tradition of this type of attack, they have been caught red-handed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with this type of bomb,'' he said in an interview. <ORGANIZATION> PFLP-GC </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, a former Syrian army captain, has denied involvement but admits his faction has used devices such as the one that destroyed Flight 103. The British <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and others have named the bombmaker as <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON>, a Jordanian member of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON> was among 16 Palestinians suspected of planning a terrorist attack who were arrested in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> two months before the Pan Am bombing. In raids in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and Nuess, police also seized Semtex bombs with air pressure-sensitive detonators, like the one that would rip apart Flight 103. All but two of the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> were released. The BBC-TV investigative program `` Panorama'' said <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON> was freed because he was a double agent working inside the Popular Front for <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> intelligence, and is now living in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. While The <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> made a connection to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said in February it was in revenge for the 1986 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. They said <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> cleared the operation with Syrian intelligence and had the full backing of the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> secret service. The Sunday Times said <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> ordered his top aide, <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalkamoni </PERSON>, to set up the bombing team, and that <PERSON> Dalkamoni </PERSON> recruited <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dalkamoni </PERSON> and another Palestinians are in jail in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as the result of the October raids. The Sunday Times said <PERSON> Khreesat </PERSON> assembled the bomb in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and that it was smuggled to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island republic with close ties to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dalkamoni </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abo </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON>, an admitted member the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, another extremist faction, went to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> and told the cell to put the bomb on the Dec. 21 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Malta </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Abo </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> is one of three Palestinians on trial in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> for bomb attacks in northern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and American targets. Court records examined there by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> confirm <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> Oct. 19-26, 1988, after spending one day in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said a baggage list shows one suitcase was transferred onto the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> from Air Malta Flight KM180. In violation of international regulations, it was not accompanied by a passenger. Air <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> says all the flight's passengers and baggage are accounted for The newspaper said West German authorities knew about the possible <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> connection in February but did n't tell the British until August, when the British said the bomb suitcase contained clothes made and sold in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. The Sunday Correspondent maintains the bomb began its journey in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. It said at least four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officers boarded a Frankfurt-bound <ORGANIZATION> Cyprus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> flight on Dec. 21 and transferred to Flight 103, and that one of their suitcases was switched. A report obtained by British relatives of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> victims said up to eight <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents were on Flight 103, returning home after pinpointing the location of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The report, said to have been prepared by a private investigator hired by <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s insurance underwriters, says the agents also discovered a CIA-protected drug smuggling ring at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Sections of the report released by <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Congressman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said the terrorists used the drug pipeline to smuggle the bomb aboard Flight 103 in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> has denied the allegations.

 Half a million cheering demonstrators today hailed <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> and told their <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rulers that a remarkable leadership reshuffle failed to meet their demands for more democracy. Unpopular <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> party boss <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON>, a hard-line member of the new Politburo chosen only Friday, resigned together with the entire city party leadership today, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said. Today's rally at <LOCATION> Letna </LOCATION> field _ the largest in the nation's history _ was shown on state-run television <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, the bold architect of the 1968 `` Prague Spring'' reforms that were crushed by a Soviet-led invasion, made his strongest comments to date in favor of reform. The rally capped a historic week of protests that forced the entire ruling Politburo to resign. `` The political leadership has lost touch with the people, and the crisis has deepened,'' said <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, 67, rejecting Friday's leadership changes as a cosmetic maneuver `` Long Live Dubcek!'' the people cried. `` Dubcek To the Palace!'' they chanted, referring to the official residence of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s president. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, who was ousted from the party he led and spent nearly 20 years in virtual seclusion, urged party leaders to hear the voice of the people. `` I appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the party to take the initiative and the ideas -LRB- of the reform group -RRB- very seriously,'' he said, speaking publicly in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> for only the second time since 1968. Prominent dissident <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> also addressed the cheering demonstrators, telling them that the opposition group Civic Forum would demand to negotiate democratic reforms with the ruling party Politburo. State-run media also reported criticism from <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members who said the measures implemented at Friday's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting did not go far enough. The Central Committee replaced the 13-member Politburo with one containing nine members, six of whom had sat on the former body. The committee also named <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> to replace party leader <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON>, 48, had been an obscure Politburo member in charge of the Czech republic. <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, 67, was the third East bloc leader to fall from power in five weeks. All were hard-liners who resisted the reforms instituted by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s 16-hour session ended early today with a retooled government in place but left questions whether the regime would embrace the changes demanded by demonstrators. Official media said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> adopted a reform program that envisioned new laws on assembly, association, the press, education and defense. But a draft law on the press published recently, for instance, foresaw stiff fines for simply passing on unauthorized publications. Opposition leaders called for a general strike Monday to demand real reforms. Referring to Friday's reshuffle, <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> said today, `` The changes did not meet the demands of the people.'' `` They -LRB- the government -RRB- are telling us that the street is not the place for things to be solved, but I say the street was and is the place. The voice of the street must be heard,'' he said to deafening roars from a flag-waving crowd that braved freezing temperatures to attend the rally. `` We appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that those who have caused the stagnation leave their posts and do not obstruct further development of this country,'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> said. The dramatic developments were chronicled in part on Czechoslovak state-run television, which on Friday night showed film clips that revealed <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> was booed by factory workers who demanded his resignation Thursday. Television showed a stormy city party meeting with lower ranking officials fiercely attacking <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON>. It also repeatedly showed pictures of the police brutality Nov. 17 that helped cause the current protest movement. Police had clubbed hundreds of peaceful demonstrators urging greater democracy. The stunning changes also have been covered in the Soviet media. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> today described the atmosphere as `` uncertain, tinged with emotion and not without a tint of political romanticism.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Zdenek </PERSON> <PERSON> Horeni </PERSON>, editor in chief of the official Czechoslovak daily Rude Pravo, told reporters the party envisioned changing the article in the Constitution that guarantees the leading role of the Communists in government. But he refused to say what kind of reform this entails. Previous comments by party officials have suggested that the Communists will remain automatically supreme in Czechoslovak politics. Jan Urban, chief spokesman of the opposition group Civic Forum, told the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a radio interview from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> the new Politburo members were all `` very experienced apparatus people with no idea of reformist thinking. He said the opposition was giving the new Politburo until Monday to show their `` reform minds'' by immediately releasing political prisoners, starting talks with the people and including non-Communist parties in Parliament. `` There's nothing to be satisfied with,'' he said. `` Not all the very compromised persons have gone.'' Seven Politburo members lost their seats. In addition to <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, those ousted included <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Indra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON> and ideology chief <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fojtik </PERSON> _ all of whom were directly responsible for the Soviet-led crackdown on the `` Prague Spring'' reforms of 1968. Although <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> lost his seat, he retains his title as president for now. Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> also lost his Politburo seat, meaning a new premier will likely be named soon. The seventh Politburo member removed was <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitra </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> had kept his seat, as did the head of the official trade unions, <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavadil </PERSON>. <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> and five holdovers were joined by three unknown new men, <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Cizek </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Huscava </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Zajic </PERSON>. What little is known of <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> suggests that he is an orthodox Communist. He criticized leading dissidents in the party weekly Tribuna in March.

<HEAD>Issues Delayed Are Issues Made Tougher In Upcoming Election Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Like members of a sports team that has just finished a rebuilding season, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are telling the public to wait'till next year. But when they return from their two-month-long holiday break, election year pressures will make tough legislative issues like deficit reduction and campaign finance reform even tougher to solve in the second session of the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> than they were in the first. `` This is an incomplete <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republican Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` And I think we wo n't know until the end of next year whether it's a good <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> started the year with a new chief, Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Then, nearly halfway through the year, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had to get new leadership when Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., resigned <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was accused of ethics violations in his personal finances, and <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> quit rather than face a similar inquiry from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s chief accuser, climbed into the No. 2 spot among House Republicans when <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> resigned to become Secretary of Defense. `` I ca n't recall any year having seen such turmoil,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Kildee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>., a 13-year House veteran `` The new leadership is just beginning to feel its way. ... It's been a salvage and repair operation.'' House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders at year's end pushed through a raise in the minimum wage, new spending to fight drugs, aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and a controversial pay raise and ethics package. A plan was approved to bail out and re-regulate the savings and loan industry, at a cost to taxpayers of perhaps hundreds of billions of dollars in the next few years. But completion of many other issues was left for the next session. Among the major ones: clean air, child care and campaign finance reform. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed campaign reforms and a bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> task force worked on the issue. But agreements were elusive, as each party pushed for advantage. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> list campaign reform as a top priority for the new year, but <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he was not optimistic. `` We have to change the method, the system, by which we elect public officials in our society and by which we finance and conduct campaigns,'' he said, renewing his call for public financing. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he also plans to introduce legislation to provide long term health care for the elderly. But he's not optimistic about that one either _ given how <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> just repealed the Medicare catastrophic illness coverage. `` There is understandable reluctance on the part of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to get into this issue, having just been burned,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> every year gets into the issue of deficit reduction, and this year was typical in that the legislation approved wo n't solve the long-term problem Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the inexperience of the Democratic leaders hurt this year's efforts at deficit reduction. `` We had two new leaders this year who were not dry behind the ears before plunging into -LRB- budget -RRB- summitry,'' <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> said. `` They will be far more effective next year. They're going to be able to exercise a lot more discipline. The leaders have to be able to enforce the agreements.'' But there also will be `` factors out there not working today,'' he said. `` The election year will make our work immeasurably more difficult.'' Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON>, D-Calif., said one of the best things the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders did was get <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> out before Thanksgiving to give themselves time to regroup `` We need this time to reflect, to see if we can come up with a legislative agenda,'' he said. `` It has been a long year. I think the membership is exhausted,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> was more optimistic about next year, foreseeing success likely on long-delayed legislation on child care, clean air and the campaign finance issue. `` We get a ` C' for the first session,'' he said. `` But we can improve the grade with a make-up in the first three months'' of next year,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A man already sentenced to 3,576 years in prison for defrauding the government received an addition 370-year sentence from an anti-graft court. Despite the long sentences, <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangubat </PERSON> will probably spend no more than 30 years behind bars, because that is the maximum time in prison the law allows. The latest sentence against <PERSON> Mangubat </PERSON>, a former regional accountant of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> and Highways, was announced Friday after the court found him guilty of 55 graft cases and four cases of falsifying public documents. <PERSON> Mangubat </PERSON> was also ordered to pay the government $ 86,000, which he allegedly pocketed by faking delivery receipts of construction materials from August 1977 to July 1978. He was also barred from holding any other public office. Last month, another anti-graft court found him guilty of 392 cases of fraud and graft and sentenced him to 3,576 years in prison.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, under pressure from state officials worried about safety, has stepped up plans to retrieve live and deactivated explosives accidently dropped onto public lands outside bombing ranges. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will start looking for the loose ordnance on <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> property outside two of its bombing ranges during the next three weeks, said Capt. <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Rackowitz </PERSON>, commanding officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Fallon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>. The search is a continuation of an exercise nicknamed `` Operation Ugly Baby'' to retrieve stray bombs that have dotted the desert at least 60 miles outside <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> for up to 30 years. No accidents have been reported involving the bombs, but state officials have been outraged since revelations surfaced that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in October began a secret operation outside its Bravo 17 range to retrieve errant explosives. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said it was secretive to prevent the curious from collecting souvenirs or interfering in the cleanup. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials had planned to start the cleanup around two other bombing rantes, <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> 16 and <ORGANIZATION> Bravo </ORGANIZATION> 19, in the spring. In a letter to Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> on Friday, <PERSON> Rackowitz </PERSON> said the work would resume now in order to better protect the public and quickly resolve the situation that has drawn the unwanted attention of state environmental officials. `` Please know that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is attempting to resolve this situation quickly and with utmost concern for the safety of the citizens and property of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rackowitz </PERSON> wrote. <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodgion </PERSON> this week cited the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for violating state law by leaving bombs on public lands. He said he might seek fines as high as $ 10,000 a day against the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for failing to notify the state about the hazardous materials cleanup, and failing to file a plan for the recovery operation. <PERSON> Rackowitz </PERSON> said some of the bombs and rockets may have landed outside the fenced ranges because of inexperienced pilots or equipment failure. The bureau has closed off lands around the ranges during the cleanup. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plans to sweep for bombs outside its Bravo 16 bombing range beginning Monday through Dec. 2 and on Bravo 19 from Dec. 4-15. About 150 naval personnel are traveling to <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON> to help. More than 80,000 pounds of scrap metal and bombs were recovered from more than 2,000 pieces of ordnance during the the Bravo 17 cleanup, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Guerrilla forces pounded a key government-held town in northwestern <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> with heavy guns Saturday after overrunning front-line positions and surrounding the town with more than 1,000 fighters. In a pre-dawn attack Friday, the guerrillas mined Route 69 _ the government's only access road to <LOCATION> Svay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chek </LOCATION> town _ and seized positions east and west of town. Their ultimate objective is <LOCATION> Sisophon </LOCATION>, 13 miles to the south, a government military operations center for areas along the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border. Government forces returned the guerrilla fire Saturday, opening up with tanks and heavy guns in blasts that rocked the trenches the guerrillas had dug in the jungles and rice fields. All day, the area reverberated with the thunder of heavy rounds and automatic weapons fire. Friday's attack was the third and largest on the town by guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the front's chief of staff, Gen. Pan Thai, said Saturday. He promised another big assault Sunday morning. `` This is the most important battle so far for the <ORGANIZATION> KPNLF </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` If we do not take <PERSON> Svay </PERSON> <PERSON> Chek </PERSON> tomorrow, we will not withdraw. We will reinforce our positions until we capture <PERSON> Svay </PERSON> <PERSON> Chek </PERSON>.'' The front is the smallest of three guerrilla groups fighting the government that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> installed in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> after a late 1978 invasion. Its fighters captured the area north of <LOCATION> Svay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chek </LOCATION> in late September, only days after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> made what it claimed was the withdrawal of its last troops from the country. The capture of <LOCATION> Svay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chek </LOCATION>, the capital of the district of the same name, would be their biggest victory of the war. But they faced vastly superior government firepower. `` They have so many mortars and heavy guns we are n't even counting any more,'' said front-line guerrilla commander Gen. <PERSON> Khun </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeng </PERSON>. Guerrilla commanders at the scene said the government Thursday increased the number of defenders at <LOCATION> Svay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chek </LOCATION> to 2,000 by trucking in 800 more soldiers just hours before the guerrillas cut off Route 69. While their jungle-shrouded guns pounded the town with mortars and rockets, hundreds of guerrillas launched infantry attacks on the defense perimeters at <LOCATION> Svay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chek </LOCATION> at 4:30 a.m. Friday. The 107mm rockets were captured last month. `` No problem, no problem! Take cover! Take cover!'' the artillery commander shouted as the Soviet-made T-54 tanks fired back. Thousands of rounds from rockets, mortars, artillery and automatic weapons pounded the earth. Hundreds of soldiers and civilians brought ammunition and supplies to the front by ox carts, foot and Soviet-made transport trucks they have captured in the past two weeks. More than 300 guerrillas arrived early Saturday to join the next assault, Pan Thai said. Guerrilla commanders from infantry and mortar units met in the jungle command post in <LOCATION> Svay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chek </LOCATION> district to plan the attack. At one guerrilla base, medics were taking off a truck a guerrilla wounded in the shoulder by shrapnel from a rocket-propelled grenade. There were no reliable figures on casualties in the fighting. Next to their hammocks, the guerrillas dug trenches in the jungles and in the rice fields to prepare for their next advance.

 A shooting spree in the parking lot of a dog track caused spectators in the packed grandstand to stampede onto the track, injuring 40 people, and a guard was shot in the leg. An unknown gunman indiscriminately fired shots from the parking lot of the Victoryland dog track toward the main track building late Friday, then drove away while continuing to shoot, track president <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said Saturday. The gunfire `` created a panic circumstance in the first floor viewing area'' of the grandstand, <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said. Several hundred people stampeded onto the track, causing most of the injuries, law enforcement officers at the scene said. Track officials said 6,000 people were at the track. There had been no arrests by Saturday morning, but police said they were looking for a dark 1975 Chevrolet or Buick from which the shots were fired. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Traylor </PERSON>, a chart writer at the track, said the shooting spree prompted officials to cancel the evening's last five races at <LOCATION> Victoryland </LOCATION>, the busiest of the state's three dog tracks, located 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>. A member of the dog track's police force suffered a superficial leg wound from a ricocheting bullet, <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said. Four people remained hospitalized Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. A hospital nursing supervisor, who asked not to be identified, said they were all in stable condition and none had life-threatening injuries.

<HEAD>Move To Show Berlin Wall Where Churchill Cited Iron Curtain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT CHARTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FULTON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> made his historic speech about an `` iron curtain'' across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in this college town 43 years ago. Now, there's a move to pay tribute to the disintegration of that curtain by putting part of the broken <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall on permanent display. Supporters of the idea say it would be a tangible tribute to <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>'s descriptive phrase, delivered in a lecture at <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> here 43 years ago. Diplomatic, logistic and financial barriers would have to be crossed. Still, supporters say Westminster is the right place for a symbol of chilled East-West relations. `` This was where <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> first used those words about an ` iron curtain' descending across <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The first glimpse in 1989 of that curtain ascending across <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> brings us a sense of closure to his prediction,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION>. `` I would like to see the memorial here which notes <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>'s moment in history bracketed with the other end of history: the fall of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. Out of government, but with a wartime leader's perspective on postwar <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> spoke at <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION> on March 5, 1946. Introduced by President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, the former prime minister called for unity between <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Then he uttered these famous words: `` From <LOCATION> Stettin </LOCATION> in the Baltic to <LOCATION> Trieste </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> an iron curtain has descended across the Continent. `` Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>. `` All these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but a very high and, in many cases, increasing measure of control from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, who died in 1965, is memorialized at the school with a towering statue, an extensive archive and museum, and in an ancient stone church that was moved from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> after being blasted by German bombs. Visitors say the rebuilt church is proof of a future after conflict, and <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> says the relocated wall could also be inspiring. `` I think part of the symbolism should be a massive gap in the wall if it's brought here _ like the cross, which was a sign of execution, that we now lift up as a sign of hope in Christianity,'' he says. `` Now, a wall that separated us has cracked and come down and shown us that physical barriers can not divide free people.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s opening of its border to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> prompted celebrations at <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION>, where students and townspeople packed the old church on a recent evening for a service of thanksgiving. `` We are here to celebrate the death of an inanimate object _ a wall,'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Ecumenical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Callaway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION>, told the worshipers. `` Yet that wall has come to symbolize all that has kept us apart.'' For <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>, moving a section of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall to <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> would be a way of bringing people together. `` Often the people of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would erect stones to momentous events, often as altars but sometimes just groups of stones. Later their children would ask them, ` What mean these stones?' `` When later generations come, we can point to these stones, if you will, from the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and say, ` This is a period in our life when we learned how to make peace.'''

<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Voters in this poverty-stricken nation choose a new president Sunday whose biggest problem may be beyond any <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> leader's control _ the civil wars raging in two neighboring countries. After years of military rule, it will be <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' third straight free presidential vote. `` One thing you can say for the current government is the fact that we are going to have free elections,'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> is the narrow favorite. If he beats <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> and takes office for a four-year term Jan. 27, it will mark the first transition of power to an opposition party since Both candidates are young, vigorous, U.S.-trained engineers with relatively conservative economic views and pro-U.S. foreign policies. The lively campaign and the feeling that <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> ca n't lose have brought a tone of pleased surprise to many comments on the election <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, 39, is a newspaper publisher who comes from a family that owns textile mills; <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON>, 46, comes from one of the counry's old land-owning families. Both candidates support the presence of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base in <LOCATION> Palmerola </LOCATION>, where 1,600 Americans rotate through on training missions, and both oppose making the arrangement permanent. The winner will face a critical situation, however. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, a country of about 5 million, has all the problems of a Third World nation: a stagnant economy with per capita income of about $ 500, a high foreign debt, massive unemployment, inflation, little industry, bad telephones and worse roads. The country got about $ 186 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid last year, about $ 41 million of it military; $ 70 million in fiscal support has been withheld until <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> makes economic reforms that were n't possible in an election year Its biggest problems, however, are outside its borders and may be outside any <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> president's control: the bloody civil war in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on the southeast, and the continuing Contra war on the southwest in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Half a million war refugees have sharpened economic trouble and created resentment. Arms smuggling is rife and ordinary criminals wield assault rifles. The U.S.-supported Contras have become an embarrassment that the country ca n't shake. This year, there was a spurt in political violence on both left and right. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers were attacked several times, most seriously in July, when seven soldiers visiting a discotheque were injured by a grenade. Both candidates see peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as vital to progress, and although both say the Contras must leave Honduran soil, neither has offered new ideas on how to do it. `` In the long run, there ca n't be any recovery without peace and security in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON>. Foreign investment, outside of bananas and zinc mining, has been nonexistent in recent years. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> has tried to separate himself from incumbent President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON>, who took office in 1986 in a split election against <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON>'s inability to solve the economic and Contra problems has hurt. He is barred by law from seeking another term. `` What we need to do is make some strong decisions. Lack of decisiveness has been most important,'' <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said in an interview with the AP. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> also points to the Liberals' successful education and health programs, although with money low the social security system has been unable to afford medicine. More than 2.2 million voters are registered and 1.9 million are expected to turn out to elect a president, three vice presidents, 128 members of a unicameral congress and more than 289 mayors. Voting is by party slate, so there can be no ticket splitting. Polls show <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> with a 10 percent lead and few undecided, but when voters are asked to select by party, the Liberals have a slight lead. Two minor party candidates are not expected to be a factor. The military appears to be politically neutral. <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> has campaigned vigorously in traditionally Liberal regions and has had some success, in part because he became the first candidate many peasants had ever seen. But party loyalty runs strong. `` Most people have their party symbol branded on them at birth,'' said <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, a carpenter in the southern city of <LOCATION> Nacaome </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> has promised to reduce the size of government and make free market reforms, guarantee that investments will not be expropriated, fight corruption and cut red tape. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> makes similar promises and adds that he will try to reach a national consensus on economic policy before the inauguration to `` rescue the nation's credibility.'' With positions similar on substantive issues, the campaign has at times been bitter and personal. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> does not use his second last name, <PERSON> Facusse </PERSON>, because it reminds voters that he is of Lebanese Christian descent _ a group resented because of their economic success. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> was also attacked at first for having an American wife who does not speak very good Spanish, but <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> proved a sympathetic campaigner and the issue faded.

<HEAD>Bad Days for Senator Pothole</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The day after the Village Voice ran a story alleging he'd made phone calls to a federal prosecutor on behalf of two mobsters, Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> was acting punchy. The report was one more in a series of blows the press has landed on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s pugnacious Republican senator, and he returned a phone call to put his spin on what had happened. But instead of his usual, `` Howahyah?'' greeting, the senator burst into an off-key ditty, based loosely on <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>'s parody about an unhappy camper, `` Hello Mudda, Hello <PERSON> Fadda </PERSON>.'' `` This is <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON>. `` I've had better `` Times and days. ...'' To the suggestion that things could n't be that bad, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> was inspired to a second verse: `` The singing waiter `` In the future. `` How you like your `` Wine and pasta?'' He dissolved into asthmatic laughter. Had <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> finally lost it? Not at all. Songs and silliness, pet names and baby talk _ this is <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> behind the scenes, schmoozing, cajoling, disarming, playing the affable dope. And right now, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> needs all the friends he can get. Just as `` Senator Pothole'' had begun to shed his image as a world-class pork-barreler and small-town machine pol, the media uncovered his remarkable ability to manipulate the federal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> to the benefit of his campaign contributors and friends. And he has other troubles. The Village Voice recounted two questionable phone calls that the senator made to then-U.S. Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> in 1984 and'85. The <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> said the calls were on behalf of mobsters; <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> denies it. Another recent charge involved <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Armand </PERSON>, a former state assemblyman who is now a lawyer in private practice. Armand obtained information for <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by drafting a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in his brother's name regarding a $ 100 million antimissile contract. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> was a $ 35,000-a-year client of <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>'s law firm. Sen. <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said he was unaware that his brother represented the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> contractor, and said he also had not known about the letter. Since last spring, each week has seemed to bring a new allegation against <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, and the charges are taking a political toll. Two recent polls _ one statewide, the other in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ showed <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>'s popularity declining for the first time since he was elected in 1980. In July, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, the Democrat who lost to <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> in 1986, asked the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Ethics to investigate. On Nov. 17, the ethics committee hired <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> as a special counsel to determine whether an investigation of alleged influence-peddling is warranted. In an interview last week, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said he is the victim of a `` pile on'' by the press, adding that he was certain the ethics inquiry will exonerate him. `` I'm proud of my record,'' he said. `` I have nothing to be ashamed of.'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said his support for housing projects has had nothing to do with whether a particular developer or applicant had supported him politically. `` Show me where there is a situation where there has been a town, where there has been a county, where there has been a worthwhile program or project that has asked for our support where we've ever turned them aside,'' he challenged. And he predicted he will be just the first senator to undergo similar scrutiny. `` If you were to ask for all the letters that various congressmen and senators sent on behalf of constituents -LRB- to -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, you will find that there are a number of grants that have been successful and that people contributed to them,'' he said. `` Are we going to say, therefore, people should be precluded who contribute to your campaign from normal constituent services? I'm not talking about things which are extraordinary or things that are wrong But a letter of support of a letter of inquiry to take a look at something? I do n't think that's the case.'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>'s image began to erode in May when the Wall Street Journal reported how the Reagan-era <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> favored well-heeled developers who contributed generously to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> and hired powerful <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consultants. Around <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, the story said, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> was known as `` the senator from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'' because of the keen interest he took in helping the commonwealth win subsidies. Some Puerto Rican developers who obtained these funds were big contributors to <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>'s re-election campaigns. <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> has since denied that he had ever tried to steer <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money to any particular developer in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> dealt <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> a second blow two weeks later, when it reported on irregularities in how inexpensive <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> houses were awarded in the early 1980s in <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> has said he played no role in his cousin getting a house and he has praised the Island Park <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> program. But the Times story also chronicled the tale of Island Park's pork barrel pool, which was to be built using a $ 425,000 grant <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> had wheedled out of a special fund controlled by then-HUD Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> In July, the village dropped the project after unfavorable news reports. How does <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> justify asking <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to build a swimming pool in a middle-class, beach front community, when so many Americans are homeless? `` It was a grievous error in political judgment,'' he admitted last week. ` ... If you want to say I was naive as it relates to Island Park, I was. Dumb.'' Throughout the summer, as <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> released reams of old files and a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel conducted investigative hearings, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>'s name came up again and again. Sometimes his name was being used without his permission, says <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>. <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> came from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> politics to win election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> after a challenge to Sen. <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Javits </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, in which he capitalized on Javits' age -LRB- 76 -RRB-, illness -LRB- a progressive nerve disease -RRB- and liberalism. In his first term, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> earned a reputation as the senator who got the little things done for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He bucked his own party by fighting against President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s demand for an end to federal subsidies that help pay for mass transit systems, and he defended tax-exempt industrial development bonds as a stimulus for creating and retaining thousands of jobs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. During his second term, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> perfected his knack for latching instantly onto issues of great public relations value, and emitting much sound and fury. `` As a senator, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> has also been shrewd to the point of shamelessness in taking practically any position, espousing any cause, and lobbying for any project or program that could be popular with even the smallest segment of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> electorate ...,'' observed `` The Almanac of American Politics 1990.'' Still, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON>, a scholar with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said in a recent interview that he believed <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> had been on his way to winning some respect as a senator _ until <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>.

 Witnesses saw flames shooting from a plane before it crashed and broke into two Saturday on takeoff from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, state radio reported. At least 19 of the 52 people aboard were injured. The Dutch-made Fokker F-28 also had not gained enough speed while taking off from <LOCATION> Kimpo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to remain airborne, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> KBS </ORGANIZATION> network quoted government safety officials as saying. The plane crashed on the runway, broke in two pieces, and its right wing was ripped off. Airport officials said firefighters with 22 fire engines took 20 minutes to extinguish the fire. The injured were rushed to four nearby hospitals, the officials said. Korean Air officials, who declined to be named, said they had no idea why the plane had crashed. The captain was among the injured and officials were waiting to question him, they said. It also was not clear what could have caused the flames. Airline officials said four passengers were seriously hurt and 15 were slightly injured. <PERSON> Yonhap </PERSON>, the South Korean news agency, said more than 40 of the passengers and crew suffered at least minor injuries. The airline said four passengers were foreigners, including two Australians, but they had no further details. The plane, with 46 passengers and a crew of six, was on a domestic flight to the east coast town of <LOCATION> Kangnung </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> KBS </ORGANIZATION> quoted witnesses as saying they saw flames shooting from the plane as it tried to climb into the air. It quoted government safety officials as saying it appeared the flight crew attempted to take off before the plane had gained sufficient speed. An aircraft must reach a sufficient speed during its acceleration down a runway to reach takeoff speed and gain the velocity to climb. The crash broke the plane in two and ripped off the right wing, one of the two engines and the landing gear, according to witnesses at the scene. One passenger, <PERSON> Cho </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyung-to </PERSON>, said the plane appeared to climb about 100 yards into the air when it began tilting to the left, according to <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>. The businessman said the pilot tried to tilt right to correct the problem, but the plane plunged nose first into the ground, it said. The jet was made by the Dutch aircraft manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and purchased by <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, airline officials said. A Korean Air DC-10 crashed in July while attempting to land in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, killing 80 people. South Korean civil aviation officials concluded pilot error was the cause of that crash and this week had ordered the state airline to increase its safety and training regulations.

 One of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' biggest tourist rides is back on track. The 154-year-old St. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Streetcar </PERSON> line, the oldest continually operating streetcar line in the world, made its first cross-city run in more than a year Friday. The streetcars made the 6 -LCB- - mile trek from the edge of the French Quarter up <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> with swags of greenery draped above the windows During an evening run, people living along <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> turned on their Christmas lights to greet the riders. `` They are the best way to go,'' said one of the first-day passengers, <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` You can have a good time looking around, and enjoy seeing things as well as it's a wonderful mode of public transportation.'' Since October 1988, one stretch of track or another has been out of commission while crews replace the track and the bed of rocks beneath it. The $ 47 million project is the first total renovation since the 1835 opening of the line, which is listed both on the National Register of Historic Places and as a National Mechanical Engineering Landmark. The vintage-1920 cars with a driver's seat at each end are considerably more modern than the mule-drawn or steam-driven cars used for the line's first five decades after its opening in 1835. Part of the problem in maintaining the streetcars has been that the rock bed tends to solidify, said <PERSON> Michie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoutz </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the project. `` It would become like big blocks of cement.'' Crews laid down thick, flannel-like fabric and a plastic grid, both designed to get water out of the rail bed and into the soil beneath it. Then new rocks, imported because there are n't any in south <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s mushy soil, were laid down and topped with new hardwood ties and heavier rails than the ones they replaced. Planners divided the work into 10 areas to close as few intersections as possible to other traffic as the parallel sets of tracks were ripped out, and to minimize disruption to the 20,000 people who ride the streetcars every day. Buses have been ferrying riders between Canal Street, on the edge of the French Quarter, and the edge of construction work. Tourists have n't been totally trolley-less. <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, said the 1 -LCB- - mile riverfront line which opened for the Republican National Convention in 1988 has been carrying 4,000 people a day during the week and 6,000 to 7,000 a day on weekends _ about as many as can stuff themselves into the four crimson cars By the time the Aquarium of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> opens next September, officials expect to have added a second set of tracks and three more cars to the route. Streetcars once ran all through this city but only two lines now exist. The lines covered by asphalt include the Desire Street route, made famous by <PERSON> Tennessee </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. One streetcar named Desire remains on display in the French Quarter.

<TEXT>
 An opposition party that has won only two national elections this century is favored to defeat the governing <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in balloting Sunday. The vote follows a lackluster campaign that brought out few differences between the <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION> and the opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> or their main candidates _ one the son and great-nephew of presidents; the other the grandson of a longtime party leader. Neither center-right party severely criticized the other, alleged campaign violations or indicated they would dispute the outcome. The winning candidate will replace President <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>, who took over from a 12-year military dictatorship in 1985. The change of political leadership was not expected to bring major shifts in policy. Polls gave <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> a big edge over the main <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> candidate, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Batlle </PERSON>, whose name is pronounced BAHT-lee. <PERSON> Equipos </PERSON> <PERSON> Consultores </PERSON>, the country's most respected polling agency, projected the Nationals would receive 38 percent of the total vote and the <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION> 30 percent. <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Batlle </PERSON> cite the same problems _ inflation, low growth, high foreign debt payments, deteriorating public services. Both want to cut government bureaucracy, allow private companies to compete with state firms in some areas, sell gold reserves to reduce the debt and reform public education. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION> and the Nationals have dominated political power for a century and a half, except during the 1973-85 military dictatorship. Political observers said <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON>, whose campaign was considered a long shot when he started 18 months ago, overtook <PERSON> Batlle </PERSON> by convincing voters he was less ideological and would undertake reforms through consensus. `` <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON> has not said exactly what he'll do, but it looks like he'll do it by coalition, not by force,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosadilla </PERSON>, a former Tupamaro guerrilla whose political wing, the <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Participation </ORGANIZATION>, supports the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Broad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> candidate for president, <PERSON> Liber </PERSON> <PERSON> Seregni </PERSON>. A favorite <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON> remark is, `` I want to be a president respected by everyone and feared by no one.'' <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON>, 48, is an attorney and was first elected a national deputy in 1971. During the dictatorship, which followed an attempt by left-wing terrorists to overthrow the government, he worked on the family ranch in central <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and practiced law. The grandson of <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s leader for five decades until his death in 1959, <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON> was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 <PERSON> Batlle </PERSON>, 62, also an attorney and senator, is the great-nephew of former President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Batlle </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON>, who set up <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s welfare state at the turn of the century His father, President <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Batlle </PERSON>, extended those reforms following World War II. Twelve candidates are running for president, although only <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Batlle </PERSON>, and perhaps former president <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacheco </PERSON> <PERSON> Areco </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> candidate, have a real chance at victory. A party may field several candidates. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION> and Nationals have three each. Thus, <PERSON> Lacalle </PERSON> will win if the votes cast for the three National presidential candidates exceed the total number of votes cast for any other party. <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> is barred by law from seeking immediate re-election. Also at stake is the makeup of the 30-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and 99-member House of Deputies as well as governments in 19 provinces. Polls open at 8 a.m. and close at 7:30 p.m. Preliminary tallies are expected late Sunday. Voting is mandatory for Uruguayans 18 years and older. Failure to vote is punishable by a small fine. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ruled this nation of 2.9 million between <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> from 1959-67, winning elections in 1958 and 1962. The term of office later was expanded to five years. <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> is due to step down in March 1990.

 Israeli warplanes attacked a Palestinian guerrilla base for the second time in three days Saturday, and Lebanese police said the jets dropped time bombs that exploded as rescuers dug through the rubble. At least two guerrillas of the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> base were wounded in the air raid, police said. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, an army spokesman confirmed the attack on the guerrilla base. He said the jets returned safely. A Lebanese police spokesman said two fighter-bombers fired six rockets into the base in <LOCATION> Sultan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yaaqoub </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, in two late morning runs. The spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said the planes also dropped about six time bombs that exploded in a 10-minute period after the air attack. The delayed blasts caused no other casualties, he said. Israeli authorities refused comment on the reported use of time bombs. `` The Israeli Defense Forces do not give information about weapons or ammunition that it uses,'' said the army spokesman, who is not identified according to military regulations. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has reportedly used such explosives in the past in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Their use was reported in the initial days of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s June 1982 invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Syrian soldiers manning surface-to-air missile batteries in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> did not fire on the Israeli jets, police said. The guerrillas opened up with twin-barreled anti-aircraft guns, but witnesses said no hits were observed. On Thursday, four Israeli F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers struck bases of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in Sultan <PERSON> Yaaqoub </PERSON> and the adjacent <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanoun </PERSON>. One fighter was killed and four were wounded. The raid was the 16th Israeli air strike on guerrilla bases in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. By police count, 18 people were killed and 107 wounded in the earlier raids. The Popular Front, led by former Syrian army captain <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, is opposed to peace overtures by <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s faction has been blamed for numerous terrorist attacks and named in news reports as a suspect in the December 1988 bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jetliner over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The explosion killed 270 people. <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> denied his group was involved.

 The stunning events in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are expected to dominate the upcoming superpower summit in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, although President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also will be discussing arms control, trade and regional conflicts from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is holding his first meeting as president with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, a more experienced summit participant, and his advisers say he is being briefed on every imaginable topic, including nuclear weapons controls and the environment. At the same time, the president has tried since he first announced the session on Oct. 31 to reduce expectations of a dramatic breakthrough _ to the point of insisting the Dec. 2-3 meeting is n't really a summit, just a `` feet up'' get-together. `` This is a first meeting, a time for exploration. It is not a time for detailed arms control negotiations best left for next year's summit,'' he said Wednesday night in a nationally televised speech. In an interview with foreign journalists <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was `` prepared to think anew'' about reducing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop levels abroad because of changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. However, he added, `` we do what we do in conjunction with our allies,'' not in private talks with the Soviet leader. The events that serve as backdrop for the summit are momentous _ the holes in the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, the changing regimes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and fast-moving developments in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, the entire Czech ruling Politburo was pressured to resign in a remarkable weekend leadership shuffle that was continuing Saturday with the largest rally in the nation's history demanding still more change. In his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> described his summit message to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leader this way: `` We will seek President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s assurance that this process of reform in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will continue. And we will give him our assurance that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> welcomes reform not as an adversary seeking advantage, but as a people offering support.'' The setting for the talks is striking: <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet warships off the coast of the tiny, island nation of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, far from the crossroads of major international events. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will meet for more than seven hours over the two days, talking Saturday aboard the Soviet missile cruiser Slava and Sunday on the USS Belknap. The ships are to anchor in <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, within sight of fishing villages on the eastern end of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> and about 220 miles north of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The customary horde of journalists will be there to cover the talks _ from a distance _ but <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will not accompany their husbands. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reputation after four years on the world stage is as a man who loves to spring surprises, and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials say the president will be prepared for anything thrown his way. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been meeting regularly with advisers and outside experts, including one session several days ago with four previous ambassadors to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The president will know about the highs and lows of the Soviet leader's perestroika program, an immense undertaking to revamp the Soviet economy and, with it, military and political policy. Administration officials say they are determined to avoid a repeat of the last superpower summit that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> played down, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, in October 1986. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> found himself in a spirited bidding match with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on who was more determined to banish nuclear weapons. Their dazzling duet crashed in disagreement over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` Star Wars'' search for a space-based shield against Soviet ballistic missiles. So no subject can be ruled out _ with or without an agenda. But as described by a number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and the president himself, <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> primarily will be a listening event for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ an opportunity to get a firsthand assessment of how <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is going about perestroika and what it bodes for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy and security interests. Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, impelled both by budget constraints and an easing of <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> tensions, already has vowed to cut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spending. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s assessment of Soviet intentions is bound to become part of the Pentagon calculations. The President proposed in May a reduction of some 30,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as part of a treaty under negotiation in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. Administration officials have under study the possibility of even deeper cuts _ either to be made in a revised proposal by the allies or to be pursued in a second set of negotiations with the Soviet-led alliance after a treaty is nailed down. The Soviet leader is in the midst of carrying out a unilateral withdrawal of six tank divisions from Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> over two years. And he has pledged to cut Soviet forces by a half-million overall. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated his support for perestroika during his presummit speech and hailed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as the `` dynamic architect of Soviet reform.'' But that does not mean <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> with crates of goodies for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> has held out the prospect of a year-to-year waiver of high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tariff barriers if new Soviet legislation to make emigration and travel easier passes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspection. But he also cautioned at a recent news conference that restrictions on trade credits would not be eased. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has encouraged the political and economic reform that spread from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> this fall to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. But he also has said he wants the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact kept intact. Nor would he be receptive to the reunification of a powerful <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ a touchy subject that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> avoided in his speech. Amid the presidential reassurances, though, could be some pointed discussion about <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech included the declaration that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> are holding off a regional trend toward democracy `` only because of the massive support of weapons and supplies from their communist allies.'' `` So when I see President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, I'll ask him to join with us to help bring freedom and democracy to all the peoples of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. Soviet weapons also are helping the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> against U.S.-aided rebels.

 East Germans worried that the drive to revive their economy could churn out more pollutants and darken the brown-coal haze over the nation have formed their own environmentalist <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most contaminated countries, with rivers awash in industrial effluent and air so heavy with smoke that visibility is cut to a few blocks in cities such as <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>. Conditions in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> gave birth to a broad opposition movement that embraces pro-democracy activists as well as champions of environmental protection. The East German Greens want `` direct influence'' on national affairs and will field candidates in elections for Parliament and executive posts, founding member <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baecher </PERSON> was quoted as saying in Saturday's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION>, a state-run newspaper. Political parties outside the Communist-controlled Parliament are not recognized by East German authorities, although officials have recently tolerated public activities by the growing number of unsanctioned pro-reform movements. Opposition groups as well as many senior Communists have called for free elections as early as next year. But a new election law must be worked out first to set conditions on candidacy and balloting, and the various political factions have not yet clarified who will draft the legislation. `` Without a functioning environment, there can be no functioning society,'' <PERSON> Baecher </PERSON> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> as saying. He said the party, like its Western counterparts, would also champion the causes of women, non-violence and `` total disarmament.'' `` Militarism threatens not only peace and security, but it is the greater environmental danger as well,'' <PERSON> Baecher </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> have been a political force for more than a decade and have had parliamentary representation since 1982. The casually clad legislators have shouted down conservatives or knitted during lengthy parliamentary debates. In a break with traditional Greens policy, <PERSON> Baecher </PERSON> conceded that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> can not for the time being renounce the use of nuclear power. The East German Greens have instead proposed boosting alternative energy sources, like solar and wind power, over the next few years to cover 10 percent of national needs. <PERSON> Baecher </PERSON> also spoke out for better ties between the two German states to help <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> convert from using brown coal as its primary source of industrial energy production. `` Such improved ties could assist in the short-term conversion to hard coal,'' he told the newspaper. `` <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> sits on gigantic mounds of hard coal that they ca n't even begin to use. We could use it to reduce emissions by as much as 50 percent.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s new environment minister, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichelt </PERSON>, told reporters in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Friday that a turn away from brown coal was not possible soon. The nation's major industrial facilities are powered by the soft coal, which emits significantly higher levels of sulfur than hard coal. Soft brown coal of the type used extensively in eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is banned or severely restricted in most Western countries. <PERSON> Reichelt </PERSON> said he expected double the funding for environmental cleanup projects beginning next year and said more stringent controls on emission and effluent were being developed. <PERSON> Baecher </PERSON> said the new party will seek radio, television and newspaper exposure to raise environmental consciousness among the 16.5 million East Germans.

 When <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> steps to the front of the podium, a thrill runs through the small crowd at a <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rally. `` It's <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>! It's <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>!'' squealed an 8-year-old girl, stretching to see the woman in jeans and a red blouse accepting presents from a group of small children. `` Her Spanish is really awful,'' remarked another resident of this southern Honduran city. `` But she seems very nice.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, has made another convert for her husband <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, who wants to be elected president of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on Sunday. `` I was always the shyest in the whole school,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I could never get up before a big group of people in English, and now I have to do it in Spanish.'' It's not the life she visualized when she met the energetic young engineering student who became her husband at <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` My father was an engineer,'' she said. `` I kind of expected that kind of life.'' She did not expect the poverty that afflicts <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, a poverty so deep that she reveals her age _ 37 _ but not her birthday. `` If they know my birthday, really poor people give me presents. You feel ...,'' she trailed off. `` It's hard to take from people who have nothing. Someone is making $ 40 a month and they spend $ 4 to buy you some flowers.'' She has two children and works with poor children at a local hospital. `` You see children with kwashiorkor, they've gone for so long their bodies ca n't function. Dozens of kids die of measles. That would never happen in the States. You see kids who drink turpentine to get rid of worms, parents who sell eggs to buy cola.'' She was attacked, especially in the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> primary, for refusing to take Honduran citizenship. `` It's like trying to choose between two children,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>. `` I did n't come here to escape the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. My father, my brother, they fought for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> would like to do what many Hondurans do and hold dual citizenship, but she said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials told her she was too prominent a personality to take Honduran citizenship without renouncing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship. The issue faded when it became clear <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> could connect with the voters. `` She's an asset. She is not faking it, and people know that,'' said <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, who narrowly trails his chief opponent, <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` Sometimes I feel uncomfortable with the upper classes. The poor people, they remind me of my grandparents, they were cotton farmers in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. When I smell a wood fire, it's nostalgic,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>. `` The poor have so much faith in what <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> is saying. When those people are so poor and so concentrated, you feel an enormous responsibility,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> is optimistic about the future, though. I'm optimistic because he's optimistic,'' she said.

<HEAD>Iranian Navy, Revolutionary Guards to Hold Joint Naval Maneuvers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of the Iranian navy said Saturday his naval forces and the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> will conduct joint maneuvers in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and the Sea of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> next month, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> television reported. The broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted Rear Adm. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamkhani </PERSON> as saying the week of war games will concentrate on training and coordinating the activities of the navy and the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. The joint maneuvers follow the merger of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s regular forces, earlier this year The two ministries were merged to streamline the military chain of command. Lack of coordination between the Revolutionary Guards and the armed forces led to a string of battlefield defeats for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. The maneuvers, which begin sometime in mid-December, will be the first since <PERSON> Shamkhani </PERSON> was appointed head of the navy by the country's spiritual leader, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, last month. The former head, Rear Adm. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein-Malekzadegan </PERSON>, was abruptly replaced as the head of the 14,500-man navy. The Iranians held their last naval maneuvers in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in mid-October. During those war games, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accused two Iranian gunboats of attacking an Iraqi tugboat and of killing one crewman. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s U.N. Ambassador, <PERSON> Kamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kharrazi </PERSON>, denied that accusation. He said two Iranian boats had been attacked by an Iraqi vessel in late October and a crewman taken prisoner. There has been some disagreement among top Iranian leaders on what to do about having two separate fighting forces within the country. After his election in July, President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said the Revolutionary Guards would be merged with the regular armed forces. But earlier this month <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> said such a merger would not take place. The merger seems to be limited to the level of administration.

 <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Pegan </PERSON> decided late was better than never for their wedding _ 53 years after their first date. `` He's still the same as before,'' the bride said. `` He was a real nice fellow when I first went out with him _ and he's still a real nice fellow.'' Their wedding was scheduled for Saturday. The two dated for about six months during that initial courtship, when Mrs. <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> was still in high school. Then <PERSON> Pegan </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Wabash </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to find work in <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION> and they lost touch. `` Everyone was working on farms then,'' Mrs. <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> recalled last week. `` He was earning about $ 30 a month, and went down to <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION> where he could earn $ 45 a month.'' Each married and had three children. Mrs. <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s husband died 21 years ago. <PERSON> Pegan </PERSON>'s wife died four years ago. On June 3, the two met again at a school reunion. `` I recognized him, but he did n't recognize me at first,'' said Mrs. <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, 70. `` He did n't know my last name, so he asked someone and got my phone number. He gave me a call and it was a real surprise. He asked me out to supper, for about a week later. But then he decided he did n't want to wait that long, and he called back to see if we could meet sooner. So he came over and we had a good reunion.'' After they decided to get married, Mrs. <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> went to tell her mother, <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON> <PERSON> Figert </PERSON>, who is 102. `` She kind of remembered him. I asked her what she would think if I decided to tie the knot again. She told me, ` Well, you're old enough to know your own mind!''' Mrs. <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> said. `` We got along real well,'' said <PERSON> Pegan </PERSON>, 76. `` There were never any cross words. I do n't know why we separated.

 Discovery's astronauts shut down experiments and checked flight control systems Saturday as they prepared to end their secret military mission with a rare Sunday night landing in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> desert. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> gave no details of the flight, but standard procedure for the day before a landing would call for Commander <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> and pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON> to run through a series of tests to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets were ready for the return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Mission specialists <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Story </PERSON> <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> were expected to pack up the experiments. Some of which were believed to be connected with the `` Star Wars'' spaceborne missile defense project, while others reportedly tested the astronauts' capabilities as military observers in space. Mission Control in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> broke the official silence on the mission Thursday to report that Discovery would return home on Sunday, landing at 7:02 p.m. PST at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Just as Discovery became the third shuttle in 32 missions to be launched after dark, it will be the third to land at night The spacecraft blazed into orbit Wednesday night from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that conditions at <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION> were expected to be acceptable for landing, with winds gusting from 12 to 20 mph. An earlier forecast had predicted winds might gust as high as 32 mph. Mission rules dictate that the shuttle not land in crosswinds of more than 20 mph. But there are several runways to choose from at <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION>, enabling the shuttle to select one that could avoid the strongest breezes hitting it broadside. Otherwise, conditions were expected to be favorable, with scattered clouds at 8,000 feet and visibility of seven miles. If the winds interfere, the shuttle generally carries enough food, fuel and other supplies to stay up at least two days beyond the target landing date. The <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base, which has been host to as many as half a million people for shuttle landings, will be closed to the public Sunday because of the military nature of the flight. The news blackout was imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which wants to keep the flight's goals a secret. However, sources who spoke on condition of anonymity reported earlier the astronauts had achieved their main task on Thursday when they deployed a 2 -LCB- - ton spy satellite to gather military intelligence over much of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> The next shuttle flight is set for Dec. 18, when <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> is due to lift off here for a 10-day Christmastime flight, during which the five-member crew will release a communications satellite and retrieve a scientific satellite.

 President <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> declared the Cabinet of the rebellious army chief, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, dissolved Saturday and named a new government to end 14 years of civil war. His predeccesor, slain after 17 days in office, was buried. In a rare display of national unity, businesses in both Moslem and Christian areas closed for a nationwide day of mourning for <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, killed by a bomb Wednesday. Church bells rang and bands struck slow drum beats as his flag-draped coffin inched through crowds in <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Zgorta </LOCATION>. His widow, <PERSON> Nayla </PERSON>, and daughter <PERSON> Rima </PERSON> and son <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> walked sobbing behind the cortege. Weeping women tossed roses and waved from balconies. Patriarch <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>, spiritual head of the Maronite community, presided over the service, and <PERSON> Papal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuncio </PERSON> <PERSON> Paolo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponte </PERSON> read a message from Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, saying the pontiff was praying for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s salvation. A 21-gun salute was fired as the coffin was put into a crypt at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, where it will remain until completion of a tomb at the cemetery. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s election Friday was `` as unconstitutional as that of <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION>. Both have been elected under Syrian occupation.'' `` They should have waited to find out who killed Mouawad before appointing a new president,'' he said in a statement. No one has claimed responsibility for Mouawad's assassination. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> put himself on a collision course with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> by dismissing the general's military Cabinet before dawn and forming a national unity government with members from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s seven major sects. The new government, under Sunni Moslem Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, is to oversee implementation of an Arab League-brokered plan to introduce political reforms aimed at ending the civil war, which has killed more than 150,000 people. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> rejects the accord, which was approved by parliamentarians in October and which cleared the way for <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>'s election Nov. 5. The military general said the plan is unacceptable because it does not provide a timetable for the withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, 64, and 23 other people were killed Wednesday by a remote-controlled bomb in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. It was not clear how <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> would go about removing <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to head off final partition of the country. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> commands the loyalty of a cohesive army of about 20,000 that stands as the nation's mightiest fighting machine. But his troops are outnumbered and outgunned by the Syrians, whose soldiers control 70 percent of Lebanese territory under a 1976 Arab League mandate to quell civil war fighting. State-run television in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> were meeting possibly to discuss dismissing <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and appointing a new army commander. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> is holding out with his troops in the country's Christian enclave, comprising east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and land to the north. He said his Cabinet is <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s only legitimate government. The 54-year-old soldier, a Maronite Christian like <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, was named to head an interim Cabinet by outgoing President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> on Sept. 22, 1988, because <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> was unable to agree on a new president. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> had been without a president since then until parliamentarians approved the peace plan and then elected <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> selected to be prime minister, also was named prime minister by <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, in addition to foreign minister. He retained Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> as public works minister, and Shiite Moslem militia chieftain <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> as minister of electrical and water resources. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> also was given the housing and cooperatives portfolio. <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> are <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main allies in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They fielded the largest Moslem militias in the war against the Christians. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sassine </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthdox </ORGANIZATION> offered the position of deputy premier and labor minister, turned down the post and flew to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> without explaining why, state-run television in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> reported. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> introduced <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, leader of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s largest <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> political force, into the new government as minister of post and telecommunications. <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, a Maronite based in the Christian enclave controlled by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s army, said his participation must first be approved by his party's Politburo. Also Saturday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> jets blasted <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> targets in eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for the second time in three days, wounding two guerrillas, in the 16th such air raid on the country this year. The target was a <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> base of <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General command. Police said at least two <ORGANIZATION> PFLP-GC </ORGANIZATION> fighters were wounded as two fighter-bombers fired six rockets into the base in two runs at 10:50 a.m.

 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> made a campaign-style visit Saturday to the opposition stronghold of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> in his latest effort to portray himself as a popular reformer and survive a crucial party congress. A <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said some of the leadership under <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, who was ousted Oct. 18, may be prosecuted for corruption. Hundreds of thousands of East Germans headed to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for more shopping, the third weekend of their new freedom to travel, one of several reforms since <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> took over. Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> <PERSON> Maleuda </PERSON> said in an interview published by the youth newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Junge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> that parliamentary elections could come as early as autumn 1990 if a new election law is passed. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> visit, broadcast on state TV, was another attempt to disassociate himself from his mentor's hard-line policies and present himself as a populist. TV footage showed him surrounded by workers and shoppers in what seemed like a campaign stop. `` I do n't think socialism is kaput,'' <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said. `` I think the disfigurements of socialism are kaput.'' Citizens grilled him about the country's moribund economy and the government's sincerity in dealing with corruption. `` Come down on Mondays and talk to us,'' said one young man in the city, where hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets each Monday. `` Then things will get better in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> praised <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> for giving `` many impulses'' to the current promises of reforms. Opposition leaders say <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s past in <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s inner circle will continue to block his efforts to gain popular support. The TV report on <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s tour appeared aimed at boosting the leader's image at a time of little trust or sympathy with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> stalwarts <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> reportedly faces strong opposition to his continued leadership within the party now split on how to proceed with reforms. He has admitted that he could be replaced at next month's party congress On Saturday, the Communists' daily newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION>, said members of <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s government could be prosecuted for cases of `` misuse of power, corruption and personal enrichment.'' <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> himself is the target of a party disciplinary proceeding and one of his top lieutenants was stripped of his membership. The newspaper said party disciplinary proceedings were under way or planned against other former officials. It did not mention names. `` Those who have made themselves guilty will be brought to accountability by the party and, where necessary by judicial officials and other agencies, both in criminal and disciplinary proceedings,'' the newspaper quoted chief party investigator <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Eberlein </PERSON> as saying. In <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> quoted opposition leader <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnur </PERSON> as proposing West German President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> as the head of state for both German nations, in a step toward possible reunification. <PERSON> Schnur </PERSON> is a member of the Democratic Awakening, which is smaller and generally considered more conservative than the better known New Forum opposition group. The official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency said an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> policeman sentenced to jail on charges of injuring a pro-democracy protester was placed back on the force on suspended duty. The move by Police Chief <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Rausch </PERSON> followed a court ruling Friday that found the policeman guilty of pushing a demonstrator down stairs after an Oct. 7 rally. The court sentenced him to 14 months in prison but an appeal is expected. <PERSON> Rausch </PERSON> was quoted as saying the policeman was reinstated because the court used his dismissal after the incident as proof of guilt.

<HEAD>Whites March in Black Township to Demand End to Apartheid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 1,000 whites received a thunderous welcome Saturday when they staged an unprecedented march into a black township and joined residents in calling for an end to apartheid. The `` March of Hope'' began Saturday morning outside a hospital in the southern coastal city of <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> and proceeded three miles to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> township, growing in numbers along the way. When the whites, including children and senior citizens, reached the township, they were loudly cheered by an estimated 50,000 black residents who filled the streets. Some youths climbed on rooftops to get a view of the visitors. `` The spontaneous welcome was amazing,'' said <PERSON> Flip </PERSON> <PERSON> Potgieter </PERSON>, a city councilman in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>. `` This was an amazing experience.'' `` You must take this message to your homes and help forge this unity which will take us to a new, non-racial, democratic <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Xhego </PERSON>, a black anti-apartheid leader. `` We hope the whole country will learn from this march and follow suit.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>'s assembly hall was packed, and tens of thousands stood outside to hear whites express solidarity with blacks in seeking an end to apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of legalized race segregation. `` This shows that good will exists in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> and that not all whites support apartheid,'' said <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyk </PERSON>, a lecturer at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeth </ORGANIZATION>. Few South African whites visit the country's black residential areas, and Saturday's demonstration marked the first organized march by white citizens into a township. Police kept a low profile and no incidents were reported. Elsewhere, four recently released <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leaders and several hundred supporters were tear-gassed in the black homeland of <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION>. The four had arrived hours earlier in the homeland capital of <LOCATION> Umtata </LOCATION> and were warmly welcomed by several thousand supporters at the airport. However, police fired tear gas into a packed Anglican church when the four men were preparing to give speeches. The reason for the police action was not immediately clear. `` I believe these policemen acted on their own crazy initiative,'' said the Rev. S. Qanjule. The police are under the control of the nominally independent government in the homeland, not the white-led South African government. The homeland's military leader, Gen. <PERSON> Bantu </PERSON> <PERSON> Holomisa </PERSON>, has said the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders were welcome in <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION>, and he was scheduled to appear with them at a rally Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> members _ <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Motsoaledi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mkwayi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Malengeni </PERSON> _ were not hurt in the incident. The four were among seven <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders freed from prison Oct. 15 in what was seen as a trial run for the release of <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the country's best known black leader South African President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said in September that the government would no longer break up lawful demonstrations, and since then there have been dozens of peaceful anti-government marches throughout the country. The decision to allow protests is part of de Klerk's larger effort to reduce racial conflict in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In his latest move, he announced Friday that four neighborhoods around the country would be open to all races, easing a 39-year-old policy of strict residential segregation. Earlier this month, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> declared beaches open to all races and called for repeal of the Separate Amenities Act, which allows segregation of many public facilities. He says he seeks an end to all discriminatory laws but also promises to maintain segregated schools and neighborhoods for whites who want them.

<TEXT>
 Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> bug experts again are marshaling their toughest weapons _ pesticides, traps, and swarms of sterile flies _ to put down a menacing Mediterranean fruit fly infestation. At stake in the medfly war is a big chunk of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s $ 16 billion annual agricultural production, farm-related jobs and the availability and affordability of a variety of produce to consumers nationwide. The battlefield for now is a 156-square-mile crescent of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburbs from the northern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> community of <LOCATION> Brea </LOCATION>, 25 miles southeast of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. They are fighting the flies with pesticide-spraying helicopters, quarantines, millions of sterile medflies, thousands of fly traps and an army of workers to check traps, remove infested fruit, release the swarms of `` steriles'' and deliver spraying notices. Officials hope the millions of sterile male medflies will mate with fertile females, preventing them from laying fertile eggs. The cost of the battle has reached $ 10 million, but the cost of losing the war and allowing the fly to become established is incalculable in a state where road signs proudly claim agriculture as its No. 1 industry. `` It would make <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> kind of an international pariah. A lot of other countries and states would slap quarantines on us,'' said <PERSON> Veda </PERSON> <PERSON> Federighi </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. `` It would not be out of line to say it would destroy the soft fruit industry in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' she said. Vegetable growers and nursery operators would also be affected. The state has faced off with the medfly before. In 1981, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> spent about $ 100 million to eradicate a statewide infestation that destroyed $ 100 million in crops. The enemy is smaller than a housefly and has dark blue eyes, a glistening black thorax with yellowish bands, a yellowish abdomen crossed by silvery bands, and droopy wings banded and blotched with yellow, brown and black. Native to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> but now thriving in subtropical regions around the globe, the medfly lives only about three weeks to a month. A female, however, can lay up to 300 eggs during a lifetime. The eggs, which can be laid in 250 kinds of fruits and vegetables, develop into maggots that feed on the pulp around them. A stricken fruit spoils and falls to the ground, allowing the larvae to enter the soil. About eight days later they emerge from the ground as adult flies. Sexual maturity occurs after four or five more days. The first medfly of the current siege was discovered in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on July 20. That find and later ones triggered quarantines, aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion, releases of millions of sterile flies, clearing of fruit from backyard trees and application of pesticide on soil where infested fruit was found. Disturbingly, trapping has continued to turn up fertile medflies as supply lines to the battlefield have grown long and thin. To prevent breeding, sterile flies must be released by the millions each week for two generations after a zone is sprayed with malathion. Now the demand for sterile flies exceeds the output of a laboratory in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> that produces them. The result has been orders to send up helicopters to give a second dose of malathion to areas that do n't get sterile flies. Authorities contend that the finds are not one big infestation but a series of isolated outbreaks caused by quarantine violations, commercial smuggling of fruit from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and mailing of produce from other countries. However, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, the leading entomologist on the state's medfly advisory panel, called the situation grave this month and said, `` The attitude is that we are going to have to treat this as one huge area. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaugy </PERSON> continues to believe the outbreaks were localized, but the debate and possibility of more generalized pesticide spraying has fanned opposition efforts. The malathion is mixed with a corn syrup bait that can mar the finish of cars left uncovered during the late-night sprayings. What's worse, opponents say, is that spraying poison into the air over cities could be a health risk. Health authorities have long held that malathion delivered in small amounts _ 2.4 ounces per acre is the standard amount, according to the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> _ is not a risk. Others are not convinced. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> City Councilman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Alatorre </PERSON>, whose district has an infestation, recently said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Voss </PERSON> that it was clear malathion `` is itself of questionable safety to the health of humans exposed to it.'' And Mayor <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichenberger </PERSON> of suburban <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> plans to ask the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> there to endorse a resolution demanding Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> prohibit malathion spraying because of unknown long-term health risks.

 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, looking back on his work for <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, says he does n't believe he could have foreseen the thrift's spectacular failure, expected to be the costliest in the nation's Nearly five years ago, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> testified before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as a private consultant and lobbied regulators on behalf of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and its owner, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, millionaire <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> objected to federal regulations restricting thrift institutions' direct investments in real estate development <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, a conservative economist generally opposed to government meddling in business, supported him. In an interview last week, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said he was surprised and distressed by <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s eventual failure because of sour real estate deals. But he said he still supports short-term direct investments when thrifts are exposed to interest rate risks. Supporters of direct investments have long argued that they can benefit S & amp; Ls struggling with a portfolio of long-term mortgages. `` I look back and I say to myself, ` Was there something I should have seen and did n't see?' and the answer is, ` There was nothing visible _ at least to me,''' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. In early 1985, <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, Calif.-based <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was a fast-growing institution under aggressive managers who eschewed traditional home-mortgage lending. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> was a private economist with impressive political credentials as President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s chief economic adviser a decade earlier. Now, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> is insolvent and under government control. Regulators say it will cost taxpayers $ 2 billion to protect its depositors, making it the nation's largest S & amp; L failure. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> is no longer a private consultant and, suddenly, his five-year-old statements loom large. As chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, he is considered by many to be, after the president, the most powerful official in the nation. The Fed influences daily life, perhaps more than any other government agency, through its manipulation of the economy and credit. In a Feb. 13, 1985, letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> deserved an exemption from regulations limiting to 10 percent thrifts' direct investment in real estate and other commercial ventures. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s management, he said, was `` seasoned and expert in selecting and making direct investments'' with `` a long and continuous track record of outstanding success.'' The institution itself was `` financially strong,'' in a `` vibrant and healthy state'' and `` present -LRB- ed -RRB- no foreseeable risk to the Federal Savings and <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. Two weeks later, on Feb. 27, 1985, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on consumer, commerce and monetary affairs that direct investments, while undoubtedly risky, were essential for thrifts to diversify their holdings. Traditional S & amp; Ls, which took in short-term deposits and made long-term mortgage loans, were vulnerable to a sharp rise in interest rates and direct investments were a valuable alternative, he said. He also endorsed a study by economist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, now with <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which cited the success of 17 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls in direct investments. Fifteen of the 17 have since failed. `` It was my view then, as it is now, that interest rate risk was the crucial problem confronting <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls _ the problem of long-term assets financed by short-term deposits. In that particular context, at that particular time, direct investment would reduce risk,'' he said. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> still believes <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> took a `` rather sensible statistical approach'' but he points out that most of the 17 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls cited in his study were located in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, later the center of the oil and real estate bust. The central bank chairman's views have been cited as one of the reasons why a petition, calling on <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulators to postpone direct investment limits, attracted 225 signatures in the House in early 1985. It is also being cited as a reason why, two years later, five senators decided to intervene with <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulators after <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> complained about their efforts to examine <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s finances. The five _ <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>. _ met with the regulators Two of them _ <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> _ said <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s views on <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s health heavily influenced their thinking. `` The problem, as conveyed to me at the time, not only by Mr. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> but also by Mr. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- an accounting firm -RRB- was that federal examiners bore substantial responsibility for creating a most destructive and irrational state of limbo for this institution,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in a Nov. 16 letter. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said he does not understand why the senators cite his opinion as a reason for actions taken so long after it was given. `` You do not rely on a 2 -LCB- - year-old letter unless you call the guy who wrote it No one ever called me,'' he said. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, as president of <ORGANIZATION> Townsend </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greenspan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was hired to review <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s condition by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rifkind </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Wharton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>. He said he could not remember how much he was paid for his work, but said he charged his usual hourly rate. The partners of the law firm, he said, were long-time, trusted associates. `` They certainly never gave me the slightest impression that these were other than good people'' at <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said he recalls meeting <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> himself two or three times, but never for a detailed, analytical discussion. The people working under <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> `` frankly I found fairly impressive,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 An state prison inmate whose sentence was to have expired Saturday was the first to be charged because of two nights of riots last month in which 123 guards and inmates were injured, police said. State police at <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> said more arrests were pending in connection with the violence at Camp Hill State Prison, but they would not give specifics on when or how many. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Diggs </PERSON>, 25, was arraigned Friday at the prison on charges of riot, kidnapping, assault by prisoner, criminal attempt to arson and making terroristic threats. <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> was set at $ 500,000. Inmates seized control of the medium-security prison Oct. 25 and 26, terrorizing guards, taking several hostages and setting fire to many of the buildings in the 52-acre compound. The riots caused $ 15 million in damages. Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> suspended one prison official and has ordered a complete investigation into claims that locks broken on the first night were not fixed, allowing inmates to pop cell doors open for the second night of rioting. No details of the charges against <PERSON> Diggs </PERSON> were released, and authorities stopped short of calling him a ringleader in the rioting. <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eakin </PERSON> issued a statement saying <PERSON> Diggs </PERSON>' sentence on a previous offense was to expire Saturday and police wanted to file the charges before he was released from prison. `` The timing of these charges relates to the defendant's impending release from custody and should not be construed as indicative of greater complicity than that alleged in the charges,'' the statement said <PERSON> Diggs </PERSON> was serving 3 to 6 years on a conviction for robbery and conspiracy in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eakin </PERSON> said the criminal investigation is continuing. `` We will begin filing charges for the majority of incidents in several weeks,'' he said. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, press secretary for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>, was out of town and could not be reached for comment.

But the new government is dominated by officials who also served the previous regime. `` We have to watch the members of that -LRB- new -RRB- Politburo to see what direction they will take,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaculik </PERSON>, editor of a Czech-language newspaper in the small central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vaculik </PERSON>, who left <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> a month after the Soviet invasion in 1968, said the change is n't yet as sweeping as what has happened in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. But he said: `` I'm excited at least that these guys are gone. I always feared that they may turn violent against the people.'' One of the speakers at rallies in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, the reformist former party leader ousted in 1968 when Soviet troops invaded. In the teens, <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s father had immigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but he returned home after spending 14 months in an internment camp in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for refusing to serve in the military. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was born in 1921, after his father returned home. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dagmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>, a Czechoslovakian-born translator who left her homeland in 1965, said Saturday she visited there several times this year on business and felt this month's upheaval `` truly was unexpected.'' `` They must have been as astonished as we were here,'' <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> said. `` Nothing was truly planned, the same way it had been in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> does n't have anything like Solidarity. It does n't have opposition parties the same as <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> had.'' `` The Czechs are not truly people with their blood boiling. They are quite stoic,'' she said. A woman who fled <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> with her husband in 1949 and settled in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World-Herald </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that she did n't believe reformers in the Czechoslovak Communist Party can be trusted. `` I do n't trust communists,'' she said. `` They lie like it's nothing. The woman said she did n't want to be identified for fear of retaliation against her mother and two sisters who still live in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. She has n't seen them in 40 years. `` We're scared. We're scared for our people over there,'' she said. <PERSON> Irma </PERSON> <PERSON> Ourecky </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Czech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Musuem </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Wilber </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, was more optimistic. `` No one really knows,'' she said. `` But it seems like, with the -LRB- <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> -RRB- Wall down now, things will be different.'' In <PERSON> Granger </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a town about 80 miles south of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> that is also predominantly Czech, residents also are watching events overseas. `` It looks like they might finally get some freedom, but it's hard to judge,'' said <PERSON> Jannine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lalla </PERSON>, who visited <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> 11 years ago `` They're a complicated outfit over there. The people are so nice, but they are afraid.'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrabel </PERSON> of <PERSON> Granger </PERSON> publishes `` Nasinec,'' a 75-year old Czech-language weekly newspaper, but has never sold the paper to residents in <LOCATION> Czechslovakia </LOCATION>. He hopes the changes pro-democracy demonstrators seek will make it easier for him to do so. `` I never thought it would be free there again,'' he said Friday. `` I've been thinking, just today, about selling the paper in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>.''

 A home for AIDS victims that was allowed to open only after a federal court battle with the city has closed after less than 2 -LCB- months because of financial problems and public ill will, its chairman says. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, chairman of the Our Place board of directors and a volunteer at the house, said the board voted unanimously Nov. 18 to close the home. Our Place was intended to house up to seven men. At least two AIDS victims lived there until their deaths. `` The house was shut down officially last weekend,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` We voted to shut it down because of the ill feelings from the public toward the home, the missappropriation of funds and in-house fighting between <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>.'' But Ms. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, former administrator of the home, said Friday that Our Place was closed because of a lack of funds, adding that she got along well with <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>, who founded Our Place. `` The reason the board decided to dissolve -LRB- Our Place -RRB- was there was not enough money to keep it going,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and I were not fighting.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said he began working as a volunteer when the home opened to balance the books and help residents. `` The money was not spent the way it was intended to be spent when it was donated,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` I was a volunteer trying to set up the books. I know there was mismanagement.'' <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>, a nurse's aide with no previous experience running a boarding house, battled with city officials for several months for permission to open the house. He filed suit and U.S. District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiehl </PERSON> ordered the city to grant him a permit, ruling that the denial of a permit violated the Fair Housing Act. `` Irrational hysteria and public panic can not support activity that ... is clearly discriminatory,'' the judge wrote. <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> got the permit Sept. 5 and the home opened Sept. 10. <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> said the downtown building that he chose for Our Place was ideal because it had a hospice next door, a hospital down the street and a doctor's office in the back. City officials had argued that the home was too close to a junior high school and was in a too-heavily traveled part of town. Other concerns included that it would cause property values to decline and people to avoid the area. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the board, made up of professionals including a psychologist, hopes to open another home for people with AIDS. There was no comment from <LOCATION> Baxter </LOCATION>; there was no reply Saturday to a message left on an answering machine at a listing for him in <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION>. Someone who answered the phone at Ms. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>'s home said she was not there.

 A British businessman who hoped to set a new distance record in a hot-air balloon canceled the trip early Sunday because of weather-related damage to the craft that will take months to repair. `` I'm terribly sorry, but we're not going to be able to take off,'' a dejected <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> said as the balloon was being deflated behind him, changing from a towering, shimmering mass into a limp rag the size of a baseball field. <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> and his co-pilot, <PERSON> Per </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindstrand </PERSON>, said frost had stuck parts of the balloon to the ground when it was laid out Friday night, and when it was inflated Saturday night the fabric ripped. The two planned to make a 6,200-mile flight across the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and land on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> early this week.

 Bottle-hurling masked militants clashed with hundreds of police Saturday after a protest march by about 15,000 leftists turned violent. Ten police officers and at least one militant were injured in the melee. Fifteen people were arrested, including eight in the violence, police said. People from across <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> took part in the march protesting the Nov. 18 death of a 24-year-old woman hit by a car while police chased her during a demonstration. Violence erupted Saturday when scores of militants turned over a police car in the middle of the city after the protest, witnesses said. Hundreds of riot police converged on the area, and were bombarded with bottles, stones and metal objects hurled by the militants, according to witnesses. Masked militants among the protesters broke windows at 14 businesses and a police station along the way, said police, who confiscated air pistols, clubs and spray-paint cans. Thousands of police officers sealed off the streets of this city in <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saxony </LOCATION> before the protest, which drew members of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION>, trade unions and church groups. The Nov. 18 death occurred after neo-Nazi `` skinheads'' and masked leftist protesters battled in <LOCATION> Goettingen </LOCATION> and police moved in to make arrests. The woman protester was hit by a car while fleeing from police. Activists say she was not involved in the fighting and that police had no right to pursue her.

<HEAD>County Won't Display Creche</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials have decided not to set up a nativity scene surrounded by reindeer and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>, even though the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> says a secular display is permissible. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in July that the county's traditional nativity scene crossed the constitutional boundary between church and state. But the court upheld the city of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s right to display a Jewish menorah, which stood alongside a Christmas tree in the City-County Building. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said placing secular items around the Nativity scene would make the display acceptable. Given that choice, the county chose to not display the creche at all. `` You have to ask yourself, how much do you want to junk it up? Then who do you offend?'' said <PERSON> Maura </PERSON> <PERSON> Minteer </PERSON>, manager of the county's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION>. `` Do you put in a reindeer and a blue Smurf? I'd just as soon not do it.'' As in past years, the county will erect a 12-foot Christmas tree in the courthouse Wednesday, along with wreaths and poinsettias, Ms. <PERSON> Minteer </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, a Jewish group in the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> area is asking the city to reconsider its decision not to place a menorah on the steps of the City-County Building this year. The menorah marks the celebration of Hanukkah, which begins at sundown Dec. 22 and lasts eight days. <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> Solicitor <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pellegrini </PERSON> said the city agreed not to display the menorah if the county could not place the creche in the courthouse. The group <ORGANIZATION> Chabad </ORGANIZATION>, which began erecting the menorah in 1980, since has held talks with Mayor <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Masloff </PERSON>'s office. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Saul </PERSON>, attorney for <LOCATION> Chabad </LOCATION>, said he last met with city officials Nov. 13 and is awaiting a decision. `` We consider this a free-speech issue, and the menorah is a symbol of free speech,'' <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> said. `` That area is a public forum and if they permit other forms of free speech, they ought to permit this as well.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision stemmed from a 1986 lawsuit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and several city residents who objected to the Nativity display and the menorah. The Holy Name Society, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> organization that owns the creche, also does n't want to see the display surrounded by secular items. The society is working with County Commissioner <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> to find an alternate downtown location for the creche.

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Communist leadership on Saturday dismantled a police squad that cracked down on human rights activists and political opponents, the state <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. It was the latest in a series of reforms since the Communists replaced hard-line chief <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> on Nov. 10 and joined the change that has washed over every <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nation except <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. The decision came one week after 50,000 Bulgarians _ in the largest protest since <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> became a Communist nation _ rallied for more democracy, free elections, respect of human rights and an end to 45 years of police repression. Interior Minister <PERSON> Georgi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanev </PERSON>, after a meeting with new party leader <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>, took away `` a number of functions'' from the police ideological department and made assignments `` to other state and public institutions in the spirit of the deep democratic changes in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said. The activity of the ideological department will be `` transformed toward protection of the constitutional order -LRB- and -RRB- the rights and freedoms of the citizens,'' <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Tanev </PERSON> as saying. While <PERSON> Tanev </PERSON> did not elaborate, he said the structure of the ministry would be simplified and its staff reduced. `` In the past ... mistakes have been made, there has been an inclination toward actions based on force at the expense of ... dialogue,'' <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> described the police unit as responsible for cracking down on `` ideological diversion'' and human rights activists. Until Nov. 17, when <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> scrapped it, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> had a law forbidding dissent. Last week, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s new reform-minded leadership set up a commission to investigate alleged corruption under <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, who had been in power for 35 years, has been accused of living in luxury at the expense of the people, and at recent rallies protesters demanded he be prosecuted.

<TEXT>
 With 16,000 members, the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is dwarfed by the 1.7 million Communist cardholders. For most of the past four decades since the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> takeover, the Socialists have been docile junior partners who carefully toed the line of the ruling party and even accepted its leading role in their statutes. But with the ruling party in disarray following a week of huge pro-democracy demonstrations, they are beginning to flex their muscles. Last week, they issued what a senior party official called a `` declaration of independence,'' printed in the party newspaper, <PERSON> Svobodne </PERSON> <PERSON> Slova </PERSON>, or Free Word. It was a formal and forceful defense of freedom of opinion and a plea for an `` open dialogue'' about the future of this country. It was published three days after police clubbed students peacefully demonstrating on Nov. 17. The crackdown triggered a wave of huge protest demonstrations that eventually brought a shake-up in the Communist leadership. At the same time, the Socialists' prestige soared. Since the declaration was published Monday, speakers at the protest rallies have addressed the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> from the party newspaper building along the square. `` You may call that statement a declaration of independence,'' Dr. <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Vyvadil </PERSON>, head of the Socialist faction in the Czechoslovak <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now, we have become a real party.'' <PERSON> Vyvadil </PERSON>, 35, portrays his party as left of center, and said it has close contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that also has increasingly distanced itself from the Communists. `` We do n't want to be heroes,'' he said. `` But the situation demands it.'' He said his party wants to be a `` party of national reconciliation'' and wants a `` consensus with the Communists, but at this moment that is difficult.'' `` Our partners accused us of heating up the situation with our statement,'' he said. `` But if they had joined us in our approach, things would be quiet again by now.'' `` The Czech people do not like barricades and heroic deeds,'' he said. `` We are all a bit conservative, against change.'' The change in the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s stance did not come overnight. Party chief <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Skoda </PERSON>, who joined opposition speakers at a protest rally last week, came out in May with a startling call for genuine political pluralism and for guarantees of civil rights. `` Without substantial progress in the democratization of political, social and economic life we shall not manage to ... gain the citizens' support for changes,'' he said in a speech that anticipated the popular pro-reform tide. A new party platform reflecting the new approach is nearing completion. It is to cover a wide list of points, ranging from a call for a stronger Parliament to a project for a constitutional court. Will the party also call for free, secret elections? `` Of course,'' <PERSON> Vyvadil </PERSON> said, `` we would like to resume this tradition the country knew under <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>,'' the first president of independent <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` But I am not sure that we will have as many candidates as we will need,'' he added in a reference to his party's growing popularity.

 Parents in one family are collecting pictures to send to a daughter they have yet to meet. A father in another home 65 miles away copes with the devastating news he had a daughter he will never meet. The players in the drama that intertwined two families and one little girl are <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> of Sebring and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> and the girl he raised, <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>. The Twiggs and <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> discovered last Sunday that they raised each other's child. <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> and another girl, <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON>, were born in 1978 in a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> hospital, swapped and each given to the wrong family. <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>' biological daughter, died last year of heart disease long before he learned of the swap. They never met. `` I feel a sense of loss,'' <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> said last week. `` Just what I lost is hard to say. Obviously I've lost a daughter, but I did n't know the little girl I do n't have a personality to remember or a face to remember or anything like that. `` I really feel like I had two daughters; one lived and one died.'' <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>, a 44-year-old roofing contractor, raised <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>, who will celebrate her 11th birthday Wednesday. Genetic testing showed that <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> was really born to the <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON>, parents of seven other children. The child the Twiggs named <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON> and reared as their own was the daughter of <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> and his late wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, who died of cancer in 1981. Both families say a switch occurred at <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wauchula </LOCATION> but they have no idea how. The Mays baby was born on Nov. 29 and the <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> baby on Dec. 2, 1978. The Twiggs are suing the hospital, and <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> is considering it. Officials at the hospital have refused to comment on the issue. Just before <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON> died in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> in August 1988, the <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON> discovered through genetic testing she was not related to either of them. After her death, they began a 14-month search for their missing daughter. It brought them to <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>, the only other white girl in the nursery at the rural <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> hospital at the same time. The Twiggs waged a custody battle in court as <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> resisted genetic testing. He sought the expertise of child pschologists who advised against it. This fall the <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON> moved their family back to central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to be closer to <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON>, whose children range in age from 6 to 21, got back his old job as an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> ticket agent in Sebring. Finally, in late October, they broke the impasse by signing an agreement renouncing any claim on <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> no matter whose child she was. But they wanted visitation privileges, and promised to let psychologists for both sides interview the girl and suggest a schedule. On Nov. 17, results of sophisticated series of blood-protein tests were returned from <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. The tests, which analyze genes, determined with a 99.9 percent certainty that <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> was a <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> and with a 98.9 percent certainty that <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON> was a Mays. Both families shared their feelings publicly last week through tears: tears of joy for the Twiggs that they had found their lost daughter and tears of pain for <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>, who had to explain to his only child she was n't his biological daughter. <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> spoke Wednesday about the trauma of telling <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>. `` She cried and cried and cried for a long time,'' he said. Then she asked what it meant about their relationship. He said he assured her, `` Honey, you'll always be my daughter,'' and told her nothing would change. `` I hope desperately we can continue to have the relationship and the happiness we've shared,'' he said in an interview later. `` I was perfectly happy with our life prior to this, and I think she was, too. I told her that it had no significance in our life whatsoever.'' The Twiggs want their first meeting with <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> to be special. They plan to send family pictures first, then perhaps meet with her alone _ without their other children. `` We'll take it slow,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> wo n't talk about his own hurt. `` I'll have the rest of my life to sort out my feelings as to what happened,'' said <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>. He wants to know where <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON> is buried. His attorney has asked the Twiggs' lawyer for the location of the grave. He said he'll visit the site as soon as he can

 While the city is trying to rebuild following the devastating October earthquake, a court-ordered change in how the city council is elected will shake up municipal leadership. The Dec. 5 election will mark a switch from at-large to district elections, mandated by a federal court to give Hispanics fair representation on the city council. `` When we look back 10 or 15 years from now and we see significant Hispanic participation in voting, <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> will be seen as a catalyst for that change,'' said <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON>, the attorney who represented the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Education Fund in the lawsuit. The lawsuit, filed by the fund in 1985 on behalf of three plaintiffs, alleged the at-large system discriminated against Hispanics. Although about half the city of 30,000 was Hispanic, until then no Hispanic had ever been elected to the council. The lawsuit was one of many filed by members of minority groups seeking to overturn at-large voting in cities across the country. Earlier this year, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected the city's attempt to overturn an appeals court's order to create district voting The election, originally scheduled for May 9, was postponed until Nov. 7 to allow time to develop the district plan. After the Oct. 17 earthquake, the election was postponed again; the disaster destroyed more than 300 homes and damaged 1,900 and displaced dozens of businesses in the town 95 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Sixteen candidates, five of them Hispanic, are vying for seven seats on the new council, which will choose a mayor from among the council members and work with the more powerful city manager. Three incumbents are seeking re-election. Housing and development, big issues last spring, have become even bigger since the earthquake, with 135 families still living in tents or shelters and many more staying with friends or relatives. Councilman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON>, a wealthy real estate agent who inspected many of the cracked buildings, last week estimated damage at $ 179 million to businesses and $ 165 million to homeowners. Earlier official estimates put the total damage in the city at $ 112 million. The most important business downtown, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s, built in 1852 and the oldest department store in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, succumbed to a wrecking ball last week. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s, a $ 40 million company that also lost two other stores in the quake, has n't decided yet whether to rebuild a big store in <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>. That decision, and many others that businesses must make, depends largely on the availability of financing and the speed with which the city can put together a recovery plan and obtain federal and state help. `` We're going to have to have people who can make decisions,'' said <PERSON> Campos </PERSON>, who became the first Hispanic council member in 1987. `` We're in trouble right now. The earthquake was bad enough. If we lose these businesses the economic aftershocks will cripple <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> completely.'' Mayor <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who is running against <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> in District 6, dismisses the notion that the city, which sits in the center of a rich agricultural area, could be headed for oblivion. `` This is a very strong, personal and old community,'' she said. `` It wo n't be any ghost town, but it is going to be difficult.'' <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> are stressing the need for experience and continuity on the new council, arguing that an inexperienced council can slow recovery. <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> opposed the voting rights suit. `` If the elections would have been left the way they were, you would probably have four or five Hispanics on the city council, if not this year then within the next two-year term,'' he said. `` One of the worst things they did was file this lawsuit. It's pitting two incumbents -LRB- <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> -RRB- against each other and causing some friction in the community.'' <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, a candidate in District 1, is among those calling for change, especially in regard to the attention paid to poorer Hispanic residents. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> opposes re-electing <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> and the candidacy of another Hispanic, saying they do n't represent poor Hispanics. `` We have to go by issues and action, and not by skin color or origin,'' she said.

 A wintry storm came ashore on the northern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> on Saturday, threatening up to 3 feet of snow in the mountains, and storm watches were posted all the way to the <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>. Rain fell at lower elevations. Snow began falling on the coastal mountain ranges of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must maintain naval superiority and modernize strategic nuclear weapons, implying budget cuts might hit the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> hardest, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday.

He also said: `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is now and will want to continue to be the pre-eminent naval power in the world,'' even as the nation's overall defense budget is subjected to cuts <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> also said `` we're going to want to preserve our strategic nuclear capability,'' adding that preservation of adequate conventional forces would be another demand. The secretary said he remained skeptical about reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` I still think vigilance is the order of the day,'' he said. `` I still think we have to be very cautious about assuming that Mr. -LRB- <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will be successful, or assuming that his successors will be more like him than like conventional Soviet leaders: <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, etc.''

<HEAD>Federal Study Says Too Many Radioactive Dumps Planned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 States are pushing for more low-level radioactive waste dumps than the nation needs or probably can afford, according to a federal report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The Office of Technology Assistance, which reviews scientific matters for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, concluded that too many low-level radioactive waste sites have been proposed at a time when less and less of that waste is being produced. The report is expected to bolster the arguments of opponents to radioactive waste sites proposed in such states as <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The problem is there is an incredible reduction in the volume of waste we've had, and it looks like it's going to continue,'' said <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> of the agency, who coordinated the study. `` From a cost-per-unit standpoint, we're estimating huge cost increases.'' Utilities and industries in 1988 created 55 percent less low-level radioactive waste than in 1980, and the amount will decrease by half again before 1993, the <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> report predicted. More than a dozen disposal sites, including one in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, are proposed to take the waste now handled at three sites. The report, given to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week during its hectic push to wrap up business before the holidays, does n't specify exactly how many radioactive waste disposal sites the nation needs. `` Frankly, it's a huge political game so there really is n't an optimal number,'' <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Friday from her home in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>. At least some of the proposed sites will cost more than 10 times the current amount to run because there is not enough radioactive waste to support them, <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> said Disposal costs now average $ 35 to $ 45 per cubic foot to handle 10,000 cubic feet of waste a year, she said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> now have the only operating disposal sites for low-level radioactive waste. Sites in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> were closed because of health and environmental dangers. When the three states balked at becoming the nation's radioactive dumping grounds, federal lawmakers gave all states until 1993 to prove to the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> they can handle their own waste Many states already have entered compacts for other states to house their waste, angering those whose backyards are selected for the dumps. For instance, seven Midwestern states have agreed to send their radioactive waste to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, prompting outrage in the three <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> counties considered candidates for the dump. The Office of Technology Assessment report gives three options: a federal limit on the number of dumps, oversight hearings to encourage states to limit the dumps themselves or no federal action at all. The agency does not endorse any option.

 Jurors deliberated for the 17th day Saturday in the sedition trial of three people, reviewing testimony by an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> currency analyst and giving little hint of what was happening in the jury room. The two men and a woman are accused of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy and the arcane charge of seditious conspiracy, which has been rarely used since it was invoked during the Civil War to prosecute Confederate loyalists. Prosecutors allege that <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gros </PERSON> <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> were members of a terrorist band that robbed banks and bombed buildings along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> from the mid-1970s to 1984. The jury recessed Saturday without reaching a verdict in the trial, which has gone on for almost a year. The testimony requested was that of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Agent <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Haldiman </PERSON>, who testified about how money seized at the time of the defendants' arrest was matched against <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> shipments <PERSON> Haldiman </PERSON> said records showed the money had been sent to branches of the <ORGANIZATION> Sovran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The indictment alleges that <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> were part of a group of four men who robbed the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, branch of the bank in June 1984. Earlier in the week, jurors asked to look at charts of footprints taken at a bombing site. The prosecution based much of its case on notebooks allegedly written by the defendants in an elaborate code that detailed strategies and recorded minutes of meetings. Defense attorneys said the books were n't a reliable record, terming them `` error-ridden jottings.'' Some legal observers have said the lengthy deliberations are to be expected, considering that the trial has taken 11 months and included testimony from about 200 witnesses. Evidence in the case filled filing cabinets and boxes stacked in the courtroom. A trial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> involving some of the bombings prosecutors allege the group took part in resulted in 19 days of deliberations. The <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> jury has diligently worked through weekends, taking only one day off for Thanksgiving and one Saturday off while a juror renewed her wedding vows. Jurors planned a half-day session Sunday.

 A <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> court sentenced three Cuban human rights activists to prison after convicting them of giving false information to foreign journalists during a drug trial last summer, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government news service reported. <PERSON> Elizardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s most outspoken internal critic, was convicted and given a two-year sentence Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Hiram </PERSON> <PERSON> Abi </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerez </PERSON> were sentenced to 18 months each. The prosecution had asked for prison terms of three or four years for the three activists. The three were arrested Aug. 6 on charges of `` spreading false information against international peace'' in an attempt to discredit <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> courts when they spoke with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television networks and <PERSON> Radio </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government station beamed to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The defendants were accused of telling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media that Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> had been psychologically tortured and had confessed to drug trafficking while under the influence of drugs administered by his interrogators. <PERSON> Granma </PERSON>, the official Cuban newspaper, said the three carried out a `` campaign of slander'' aimed at `` discrediting the action of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> courts'' during <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>'s trial. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, a Cuban war hero, and three other men were executed in July following trials that revealed a criminal ring in the Cuban defense and interior departments that helped smuggle drugs from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The trial and the corruption it revealed were extremely embarrassing to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s communist leader, <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who had insisted for years that accusations of drug trafficking were part of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plot to discredit his government. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, imprisoned for more than six years since 1972, co-founded the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 and the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> in 1987.

 News media in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc on Saturday generally lauded the political upheavals in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> that removed hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders but the dramatic events were virtually unreported in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. Romanian party chief <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> has firmly opposed the democratic reforms sweeping Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and on Friday the 71-year-old <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was re-elected to another five-year term as party leader. Soviet television's nightly news program Vremya said that as changes transformed <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> the Czechoslovak `` leaders _ now the country's former leaders _ repeated like prayers the words ` order' and ` quiet.''' Vremya commentator <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> said in the broadcast from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, `` Quiet, if you mean the synonym of stagnation, such quiet is not needed by a country which has embarked on the road to democratization.'' Vremya praised the Czechoslovak protesters for maintaining order during their massive protests. The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is willing to form a coalition government with other parties. Although Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms are credited with providing much of the impetus for the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has given no indication of accepting such a coalition arrangement. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted former <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> as blaming his country's crisis on `` military interference in the affairs and life of the Czechoslovak people.'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> obviously referred to the Soviet-led <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pack invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in August 1968, which crushed <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s reform administration that had introduced what became known as the `` Prague Spring.'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was ousted and a hard-line party leadership installed. The Soviet government has not renounced the invasion, but some other East bloc countries have. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> also said the Czechoslovak opposition did not seem to have `` a harmonious and clear-cut action program,'' and many people were looking to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` to take the country out of the crisis.'' In <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which is moving toward a full multi-party system, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemzet </ORGANIZATION> said, `` The Prague Domino Has Fallen: the Czechoslovak Party Leadership Resigned.'' Polish party leader <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> congratulated <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> on his election as new general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, sending wishes for the `` successful development of social-political reforms in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has a coalition government and its premier, a former Solidarity activist, is the first non-communist government leader in the Eastern bloc. In non-aligned <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, newspapers headlined the resignation of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s hard-line party leader <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>. `` People are embracing, champagne bottles are being opened, columns of cars are rhythmically sounding their horns,'' said the <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Politika </ORGANIZATION>. A <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> Ekspres headline said: `` No one -LRB- stood -RRB- by <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>.'' In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, former Soviet prisoner <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> that the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> made him feel `` exactly as I did when I was released. `` On the one hand you're afraid to believe it,'' he said. `` Maybe it's just another dream you're having while in solitary confinement.'' He spent nine years in Soviet prisons and labor camps before being freed in an East-West exchange Feb. 11, 1986. He had been sentenced to 13 years in 1978 on charges of anti-Soviet espionage for his contacts with Western media and criticism of the Kremlin. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>, 41, is the chairman of a Soviet Jewry Zionist Forum group he founded two years ago to help Soviet Jewish immigrants adjust to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

 The National League of Cities' annual convention opened Saturday with drug trafficking and getting federal help to fight it key topics of discussion for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s mayors. Also on the agenda for discussion during the five-day meeting are ways of dealing with such issues as pollution, ethics in government and getting more money out of the federal government.

 More than half a million demonstrators Saturday scoffed at a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> shake-up and cheered <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> as he urged leaders to resign and make way for democratic reforms. The beleaguered government bowed to some of the protesters' demands, releasing a group of prominent political prisoners and declaring a willingness to give non-Communists greater power Also Saturday, the entire <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> resigned under increasing pressure for reform. There were indications the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> party chief, <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON>, was leaving the nation's ruling Politburo as well. On Friday, the 13-man <PERSON> Politburo </PERSON> resigned and the party's policymaking <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> replaced it with a nine-man Politburo containing several hard-line holdovers including <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> Another Central Committee meeting was planned for Sunday, with the government-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> saying only that the gathering would deal with `` political and organizational questions.'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, the reformer ousted after <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact tanks crushed his `` Prague Spring'' movement in 1968, was shown for the first time live on national television as he addressed a sea of flag-waving, roaring demonstrators at <LOCATION> Letna </LOCATION> field in northern <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. It was the largest rally in the nation's history. `` Long live Dubcek!'' the people cried. `` Dubcek to the Palace!'' they chanted, referring to the official residence of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s president. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, who was heckled just days earlier for making what some considered overly cautious comments, unleashed his strongest public assault on Communist leaders in more than 20 years. He said Friday's party changes had failed to go far enough. `` The changes did not meet the demands of the people,'' he said. `` The political leadership has lost touch with the people, and the crisis has deepened.'' `` We appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that those who have caused the stagnation leave their posts and not obstruct further development of this country,'' said <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, 67, speaking publicly for the third straight day. Leading dissident <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> welcomed the Politburo resignations but also told the crowd further changes were needed. `` Although some of the most discredited people ... were eliminated, we are deeply concerned by the new personnel lineup of our top party bodies,'' he said. In a 16-hour session that streched into early Saturday, the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> replaced party boss <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> with <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON>, a little-known, 48-year-old Politburo member who had been in charge of the Czech republic. <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, 67, became the third East bloc leader to fall from power in five weeks. All were hard-liners who resisted the reforms inspired by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Five Old Guard Politburo members who were closely linked to the hard-line policies pursued since the 1968 invasion stepped down, but <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> and five colleagues retained their seats. <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON>, in his first televised speech to the nation Saturday, opened the way for a more genuine coalition government and admitted past party mistakes. `` We have to distance ourselves from all who have misused their functions or positions,'' he said. `` Only then will people believe that we want to end corruption. `` We know that we must sit down and negotiate with all those who are concerned about the destiny of our country,'' <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> said. He said he would talk with anyone, including opposition leaders and `` those who left or had to leave the party after 1968.'' He appeared to refer to <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, who was purged along with half a million other Communists. But <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> said his offer was `` nothing new'' and it was unclear how much power the Communists are willing to share, and when. There are four other parties besides the Communists in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Traditionally docile, they have no powerful ministries but recently have become increasingly independent. A leading Socialist who spoke on condition of anonymity said last week his party would be `` very reluctant'' to join a Communist-dominated coalition. Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, ousted from the Politburo on Friday, said on national television that he was prepared to initiate dialogue with Civic Forum, the main opposition movement, whose leaders have called for a two-hour general strike Monday. `` Last week, I undertook such dialogue, but we can not leave it unfinished. We must meet again and solve problems with which both sides are concerned,'' <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said. `` I think we can do it sometime next week.'' State-controlled television shed any semblance of censorship after the party shake-up. It showed <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> under fierce attack at a party meeting. On Friday, it showed workers yelling `` Resign!'' as he spoke at a factory. On Saturday, <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> stepped down from his municipal post along with the rest of the city leadership. There were indications he would lose his Politburo job as well. Sources speaking anonymously at the <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency said they were informed of <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON>'s departure from the Politburo but had not been authorized to carry the dispatch. <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON>'s Politburo seat was due in large part to his job as influential <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> party boss, so his resignation on the local level strongly suggested he was also on his way out from the Politburo. The influential <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> party urged further personnel changes, including the resignation of trade union chief <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavadil </PERSON>. It also urged an unusual congress to consider further changes to renew trust in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In a concession to demonstrators, President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> granted amnesty to leading jailed dissidents <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jirous </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Polansky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Starek </PERSON> and ordered charges dropped against five other prominent government critics, <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> reported. They are among the best known of about 30 `` prisoners of conscience'' held in Czechoslovak jails. Television repeatedly showed scenes of police clubbing peaceful protesters on Nov. 17, an attack that sparked a historic week of demonstrations. And it showed a gathering Saturday in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> of at least 100,000 demonstrators.

 In <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, klieg lights aimed at crack houses discourage nighttime drug deals. Havens for drugs are torched in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dorado </LOCATION>, Ark. Helmeted Philadelphians sabotage pushers with dusk-to-dawn street vigils. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cities are battlefields in a way far different from <LOCATION> Bunker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> or Bull Run. This enemy is drugs, and the weapons include community hotlines in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, newspaper coupons in <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and 1960s-style activism in <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. `` It's a grassroots war,'' said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Arndt </PERSON>, spokesman for the national League of Cities. `` Drugs is far and away the No. 1 issue for our cities, ahead of poverty, homelessness, affordable housing and trash disposal.'' Images of war are beamed nightly by television into the nation's living rooms Police commandos wear flak jackets to shield them from assault guns. The number of body bags rivals <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> casualty lists. Killings erupt from gang wars in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to the murder capital of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the commander-in-chief, formally declared war in September, saying drugs would be fought `` block by block, child by child.'' Soldiers in the fight applauded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s rallying cry but criticized the limit of federal dollars, which puts the burden on cities to pay for the combat. `` You can declare war all you want. We ai n't got the ammunition,'' said Sheriff <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Bair </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> `` The front line is asked to supply the rear. It's like the <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> invasion financing itself by holding a rummage sale,'' said <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON>, president of the League of Cities. `` Is that any way to win a war?'' The League of Cities is pushing Dec. 3-9 as national `` Fight Back Against Drugs Week'' to give the war on drugs some momentum. An underground army has formed of citizens who have had enough. But criminologist <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> cautions that fighting should be left to professionals. `` Rather than encouraging open combat, officials could ask citizens to keep their heads down. Not even <PERSON> Smokey </PERSON> the Bear wants us to rush into forest fires with a garden hose,'' <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said. The number of bystanders shot and murdered in drug-related shootings has tripled in the last three years in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said. From 1986 to'88, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> had 128 bystander deaths, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> 105. Police would like to see better national strategies, such as a national tipline to snitch on drug dealers and stiff fines to make the drug trade less profitable. `` What we are doing is fighting a war. We have not gotten into a mindset of winning the war,'' said <PERSON> Sevrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. In the meantime, the combat goes on. <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>, a city of 50,000 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s apple country, has become a cocaine distribution point for the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, police say. Drugs are smuggled in from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> by agents who blend in with migrant farm workers. To make the drug trade conspicuous, police train four 500-watt lights on suspected drug dens. Their purpose is similar to air raid lights discouraging attacking warplanes, and police said they have reduced traffic 95 percent to the buildings since September. `` We want to create a strong sense of paranoia among dealers and users,'' said Police Chief Pleas <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. `` We're forcing people out of their comfort zone.'' But an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> is unimpressed. `` It sounds like a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> approach to the war on drugs,'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. The southern <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dorado </LOCATION>, population 26,000, condemned three suspected crack houses and set them on fire this spring. `` It was really interesting to see people in the neighborhood standing on the porches, cheering and applauding when the houses were burning,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Combs </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Inglewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, police have infiltrated suspected crack houses to run sting operations. When users come to buy drugs, they're busted. In the past 15 months, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> has sealed 600 abandoned houses with cinder blocks and stucco to keep out dealers and their trade. A network of community anti-drug groups has spread across <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> in the past two years. Wearing white plastic helmets, residents hold all-night vigils to push dealers off street corners. `` We all have to get out there and roll our sleeves up. It's the worst crisis to hit <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrice </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor and community leader. The country's heartland, too, has mobilized. In <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, police opened a hotline for residents to report crack activity in their neighborhoods. It averages about 65 calls a week from private citizens. `` Nothing will frighten the pushers so much as to know that apathy is officially dead in central <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and we're on the march,'' Mayor <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> said. Community activists also joined the battle with a block watch program. `` The only way we're going to eliminate the drug problem is to pitch in and do some of the dirty work. The police ca n't be everywhere all the time,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Olde </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neighborhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Baseball is an ally in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON>, the billionaire owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royals </ORGANIZATION>, pledged free college tuition to 500 students at one of the city's most neglected high schools if they stay off drugs. Under the $ 10 million experiment, the entire 9th and 10th grades at <ORGANIZATION> Westport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> will go to college if they pass random drug tests. `` You give them hope, you give them opportunity, you show them that somebody cares about them, and they'll stand up to other people. They'll turn out good,'' <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> said. The passions of war can even overwhelm anti-tax sentiments. This month, voters in the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area approved a quarter-cent increase in the sales tax to raise $ 98 million over the next seven years to fight the war. `` The people are fighting back,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Serviss </PERSON>, treasurer of Citizens Against Drugs. `` They are sick and tired of being locked in their homes and intimidated by drug dealers.''

 The black community of <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, which was terrified by an all-night riot 14 months ago, has become the personal battleground of activist and former comedian <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> arrived in June in the northwestern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> city of 200,000. He converted A.B. <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, once overrun by dope dealers, into a joyful, child-filled bunker.

I'm here for the same reason people go to war,'' <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said. `` We want our neighborhoods back. We want people who'd be willing to die, but not willing to kill.'' In the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> community of <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, police worked with the <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Herald </PERSON> to come up with a newspaper coupon so readers could anonymously list the names of anyone they suspect of using or selling drugs. `` I'm quite sure we're going to be able to achieve some arrests through this,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Bienke </PERSON>. But Councilman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> criticized the campaign as `` a Big Brother syndrome.'' Said Rowland: `` Apparently, it's drugs today. What is it next week, political subversives?'' Battlelines stretch from <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Phoenixville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. Authorities in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> target casual users.

<HEAD>OPEC Ministers Open Meeting, Try to End Production Cheating</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers formally opened a strategy meeting Saturday and then turned to private bargaining to try to end production cheating by some of the 13 member nations. Several ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> said they wanted crude prices to go higher. `` I would like to see them rise,'' Saudi Arabian Minister <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> said at the start of the group's winter conference. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqazadeh </PERSON> said the cartel `` must get'' to its target price of $ 18 a barrel. A basket price of crudes monitored by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> recently hit $ 17.76 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, has been trading around $ 20 per barrel. Middle Eastern crudes run several dollars less. The petroleum ministers, who arrived in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> several days ago for informal talks, have as their goal a new production and pricing agreement for the first half of 1990. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s output ceiling now is 20.5 million barrels a day, but actual production is estimated at more than 23 million barrels. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> told his colleagues the market `` can easily absorb'' an average of at least 21 million barrels a day next year. A stumbling block in arranging a production deal is demands by <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> for bigger shares of the cartel's output. Both have ignored the current accord and pump well over their quotas. Their actions have angered other members who believe prices would be higher with more restraint. During private discussions <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has proposed that some countries, like <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, be allowed to produce more. `` I think it is a positive concept,'' said <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, according to analysts, is pumping close to 2 million barrels a day, nearly double its quota. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>' <PERSON> Mana </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON> declined to say what quota he wanted. He said his country is producing `` more than 2'' million barrels a day, or double its quota.

 A plane carrying mostly Soviet missiles and other weapons presumably for leftist rebels crashed near this southeastern village Saturday. Three crew members were fatally injured and a fourth apparently committed suicide. Salvadoran and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officals said the flight of the single-engine <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> originated in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and that the crash was proof <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed Sandinista government smuggles weapons to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s guerrillas. A second plane also apparently on an arms smuggling mission was burned at a landing strip southeast of the capital <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Both planes apparently ran out of fuel. Later, rebels fired on a military helicopter carrying reporters to the site of one of the two planes and two foreign cameramen were wounded. Colleagues said <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgos </PERSON>, a camerman for <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a reporter for the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government radio network were wounded when the guerrillas opened fire near <LOCATION> Zacatecoluca </LOCATION>, 18 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The pilot managed to land the helicopter at the <LOCATION> Comalapa </LOCATION> international airport and doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Burgos </PERSON> was in serious but stable condition and <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> suffered minor injuries. The Cessna was carrying 25 shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles _ 24 Soviet-made and one U.S.-made _ a Soviet-designed anti-tank weapon and mortar shells. It crashed in a soybean field just north of the town of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Transito </LOCATION>, about 60 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The Salvadoran military press office reported Saturday afternoon that the second light plane, which had been used to smuggle weapons to the rebels, was set afire on a dirt landing strip 7 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Zacatecoluca </LOCATION>. It said residents of the area told army officers the plane's crew unloaded boxes, presumably containing ammunition, after it landed The press office said the plane apparently did not have enough fuel to take off and the crew burned the craft and then fled. The Cessna, painted black and with no registration number, did not burn. Col. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Casanova </PERSON>, commander of the 6th army brigade, said it crashed when it ran out of fuel. <PERSON> Fredy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garay </PERSON>, a peasant who lives about a mile from the crash site, told reporters he heard a sputtering motor and the sound of a crash at 5:30 a.m. He said as he and a friend approached the wreckage they heard a single shot. <PERSON> Garay </PERSON> said two of the plane's crewmen were dead, one died shortly after he and his friend arrived and the fourth was dead from a bullet wound in his right temple. Three of the victims wore military fatigue uniforms. None of the four had identification papers, and officials said it was presumed they were Nicaraguans. An officer showed reporters a Belgian-made <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> pistol that he said presumably was used by the crewman who shot himself. Engraved on the pistol was, `` <ORGANIZATION> Guardia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION>'' _ Nicaraguan national guard. The rear cargo section of the plane was intact but the front section was destroyed. Salvadoran troops and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military adviser were at the <LOCATION> Piedra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacha </LOCATION> site within an hour after the crash. When reporters arrived at midday the weapons had been placed in front of the wreckage _ 24 Soviet-made SAM-7 missiles, one U.S.-made Redeye anti-aircraft missile, a Soviet-made 75mm recoiless rifle and 21 Soviet-manufactured 82mm mortar shells. A flight plan found in the wreckage indicated the plane was to have landed at a beach near <LOCATION> Amatecampo </LOCATION>, south of the capital. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Turcios </PERSON> told reporters the surface-to-air missiles represented `` a great threat.'' He also said the plane `` was proof of Sandinista intervention in the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> conflict, of their aid to the terrorists.'' Guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> have not used surface-to-air missiles in their 10-year-old war against a succession of U.S.-backed governments. Such missiles could provide a tactical boost to the rebels, who last week waged their biggest offensive of the war. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> is northwest of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the two countries are separated by the Gulf of <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. They do not share a land frontier.

 Election officials on Sunday threw out results and ordered new balloting in Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s district because of vote fraud, affecting about 100,000 voters and dealing a major blow to <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s re-election efforts The election, with voting staggered over three days on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, has been tainted by allegations of fraud. It also has become one of the bloodiest campaigns in independent <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 42-year history. The death toll since polling began rose to 107 Saturday when at least six people were killed, including a state assembly candidate fatally wounded by a bomb as he rode his motorcycle in the northern town of <LOCATION> Allahabad </LOCATION>. At least 153 people have been killed since campaigning began in October. Sunday, a respected magazine, released results of a poll that indicated <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would be `` hard pressed'' to win 200 seats in the 543-seat <LOCATION> Lok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sabha </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s lower house, which will choose the next prime minister. The poll was based on interviews with 11,500 voters. The <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> issued the stunning order on <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Amethi </LOCATION> district early Sunday after 10 hours of deliberation It ruled as invalid the balloting Wednesday and ordered new elections to be held in 98 precincts Monday. About 1,000 voters were registered in each of the precincts. The commission said there were `` serious lapses'' in the <LOCATION> Amethi </LOCATION> voting and ordered the <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state government to immediately replace the superintendent of police in charge of polling arrangements along with another officer for alleged ballot rigging. It directed the state to initiate disciplinary action against the two men. Chief Election Commissioner R.V.S. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> <PERSON> Sastri </PERSON> said the decision on <LOCATION> Amethi </LOCATION> was critical for <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s future. `` It is the country that is involved, not merely the prime minister,'' he said. An opposition coalition had accused the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> election </ORGANIZATION> fraud in <LOCATION> Amethi </LOCATION>, 350 miles southeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, even before the balloting ended Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Anand </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON> denied the allegations and said the opposition was engaged in a plot to embarrass the prime minister, who has represented <LOCATION> Amethi </LOCATION> since 1980. So far, the <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has cast out the balloting in 1,236 of the country's 590,000 polling places and ordered new elections. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has 498 million eligible voters. Initial election results are expected late Sunday. The top candidate to become prime minister if the opposition wins told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he would not take the job. <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who heads the five-party opposition coalition known as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said he would run the party instead. `` It is political suicide to depend too much on an individual,'' said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. `` So I have decided not to accept any proposal to become the prime minister.'' There was no voting Saturday, but violence persisted. In <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s biggest city, political activists battled, and a polling agent was killed in the turmoil. Police fired in the air and used tear gas to disperse the angry mob. Two other people were killed in the southern states of <LOCATION> Andhra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION>. At least 150 Indians fled into <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> because of political clashes in the far eastern state of <LOCATION> Tripura </LOCATION>. The elections will determine whether <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> remains in power or falls to the most cohesive opposition challenge since <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> won independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. The main campaign issue has been <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s leadership. Neither party has called for major changes in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s domestic or foreign policy. Reports of high-level corruption have damaged the 45-year-old prime minister's image as a reformer. Massive security was prepared for Sunday's vote in tiny <LOCATION> Sikkim </LOCATION> in the state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, where Sikh separatists have killed more than 1,650 people this year, and in the state of <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION>, where clashes between Hindus and Moslems have killed at least 300 people in six weeks. The election turmoil has brought doomsday editorials in newspapers. `` Poll perversion'' said the independent Times of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. It called the election in <LOCATION> Amethi </LOCATION> `` a national disgrace'' and said: `` If this is the example set in the prime minister's own constituency, he is left without moral authority to control the hoodlums and mafia dons who make a mockery of the democratic process in other parts of the country.''

 About 300 mourners packed a church Saturday to remember a newspaper reporter slain in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> while investigating narcotics and terrorism there. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has joined the probe into the slaying of <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 28, of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper reported. `` He went for the story,'' <PERSON> Ruel </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a friend of <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s family, told mourners at the funeral at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> `` You see, it was part of his calling, his assignment. Risk is a part of reporting.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> had been on vacation. His body was found Tuesday in the remote town of <LOCATION> Uchiza </LOCATION>, with a placard nearby denouncing `` North American spies.'' An autopsy revealed his neck had been broken and found evidence he had been beaten. Authorities suspect the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION>, a Maoist guerrilla group, in <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was in the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> region of central <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, which is considered the world's largest source of the coca leaf used to make cocaine. The area has been in turmoil since Shining Path guerrillas recently started extorting payments from peasants and Colombian traffickers to finance their effort. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an expert on <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, had covered jungle warfare in Central America. Although on vacation, he apparently was gathering material for stories. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> told mourners that <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s courage stemmed from his devotion to his work. `` <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>'s works, the practices of his calling as reporter, are the most telling comments on his life,'' the <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, man told mourners. When <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> died, his focus was on his story, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> did not live a life that calls for flamboyant terms,'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> said. `` He was no hero. He was a reporter doing his job _ prudently, quietly and with spare prose.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> reportedly was last seen on Nov. 17, when he was to have flown home. There were reports that he was overpowered at gunpoint at the airport on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Uchiza </LOCATION> or kidnapped from a car on the way to the airport. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is working with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the Peruvian government in the investigation into <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s slaying, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kortan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. A memorial service for <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> is to be held Monday in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> blamed striking machinists for bomb threats against a flight Saturday, claiming their union was trying to frighten travelers away from the airline during the holiday season. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union denied that union members had anything to do with the threats. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> received a call warning that Eastern Flight 90 from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, due in at 4:38 p.m. Saturday, was the target of a bomb threat. The anonymous caller said he had heard about the threat while monitoring air traffic. Other news media also received tips on alleged bomb threats, according to the airline and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Eastern spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said the carrier received several bomb threats involving Flight 90, including one from a caller who identified himself as a striking Eastern mechanic. After the information was evaluated, the carrier determined the threats were a hoax, she said. The flight was not disrupted. `` Whoever the caller or callers were, they spent more time calling the media ... I think this is indicative of their -LRB- the Machinists' -RRB- shift in tactic to try and frighten travelers over the holiday period,'' she said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, president of Machinists District 100 in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, denied strikers were involved. `` I can assure you we are not inolved with any illegal activity or bomb threats ... that kind of activity can be traced, and we encourage them -LRB- Eastern -RRB- to do so and stop the rhetoric,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. `` We have rigorously and constantly told our membership not to do anything illegal.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> vowed Friday to continue and intensify their 8 -LCB- - month strike despite announcements Wednesday and Thursday that the pilots and flight attendants were ending their walkouts, which began in March in solidarity with the Machinists' 8,500 members Another Eastern spokesman, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON>, said strikers were `` trying to create a big stir, and this is a peak travel weekend. I believe there's a direct relation between the -LRB- bomb threat -RRB- tips and the union workers' announcement about changing tactics.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> were told about the threats, <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said.

 Police said they were questioning 10 people Saturday who were among the 339 passengers aboard a Saudi jumbo jet on which a bomb was found. <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arabian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said it was `` with God's blessing'' that the defective time bomb did not explode on board the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, which was rerouted to this southern port city while flying from <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. While the plane was flying over the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on Thursday night, airport security in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> received an anonymous letter threatening to blow the plane up unless a demand for $ 15 million was met, officials said. Flight 367 landed safely in <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Moinuddin </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s bomb disposal squad in <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, said eight ounces of dynamite were found in an untagged school bag. It was surrounded by clothes, a cigarette lighter and a box of matches, said the official, who uses only one name. The bomb was set to go off 35 minutes after the jumbo jet took off from <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, officials said, but a battery apparently jarred loose, detaching a wire to the detonator. In its statement issued in <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the airline said 332 adults and seven children were aboard. Police gave few details about the 10 passengers held for questioning. `` We have n't laid any charges; we are just questioning them,'' said a <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> police official on condition of anonymity. He said all 10 were from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s North West Frontier Province. <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> police said they also were questioning a taxi driver who delivered the extortion letter to an <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> airport officer shortly after Flight 367 left <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. The note demanded $ 15 million in ransom to be deposited in three bags at a location in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, said the Saudi airline. Pakistani police earlier put the figure at $ 1.5 million. No one has claimed responsibility for placing the bomb on the plane, and police have refused to discuss possible suspects. A terrorist bomb exploded aboard a New York-bound <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 people on the ground. Investigators determined the explosion was caused by a bomb hidden in a cassette-recorder.

 Entertainer <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> returned to the air Saturday night, saying it's great to be back on radio but that broadcasting from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> instead of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> feels just a bit strange. At the start of the live, two-hour program broadcast nationally on public radio stations, <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> wondered aloud whether anyone in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was listening. He said it felt `` just a bit odd to do a show in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. You walk around the streets here and you see all the cars on the streets with signs in the windows that say ` no radio in car.' Sort of feel like you've lost half your audience right there.'' <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> said he has learned it's safer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` if you talk to yourself. So I do that. English mostly. Danish for variety.'' Saturday's premiere of `` <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> of the Air'' from the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> featured a humorous skit about upper-crust volunteers doomed to fund raising for public television, satirical slaps at authors and booksellers, an appeal by a fictitious group that helps clothe featherless turkeys and several musical interludes. The show marked <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON>'s return to radio after a two-year absence that began when he ended `` A Prairie Home Companion,'' which drew 4 million listeners each week on public radio stations.

<TEXT>
 Violinist <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> gave a benefit performance Saturday across the street from the courthouse where he was sentenced last month on a drug-related charge. <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> began with the `` Sonata in G Minor'' by <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bach </PERSON>. He dedicated the concert before an appreciative audience of about 75 people at a church to a co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. `` It's not easy coming back, but I'm here because I want to face my demons,'' <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> said in an interview before the concert. `` I'm grateful for my new health and I'm happy to be here on different terms. <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON>, 39, was arrested July 27 and convicted of breaking into a <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard motel room. A search of the room turned up a bottle containing more than 20 grams of cocaine, a hypodermic needle with a small amount of heroin and a dagger. <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> pleaded innocent to charges of possession, but after pleading guilty to the breaking and entering charges he was sentenced to three years' probation under which he is subject to random drug testing. The violinist had planned Saturday night's concert as a gesture to the community that he feels started him back on the right track. `` I'm grateful for the way my case was handled and for my recovery and the fellowship I have found. It was here that the intervention took place. That started me on the program of sobriety.'' Proceeds from the concert were to be donated to a drug education program at the public schools on <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard, a resort island south of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON>, an acclaimed violin virtuoso, won a silver medal in the 1974 <ORGANIZATION> Tchaikovsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competition </ORGANIZATION> at age 24. After a period of dazzling success, critics began accusing him of playing only showy crowd-pleasing selections that lacked maturity. His career began to tumble, reaching its nadir in the motel room arrest. <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON>, who recently spent 28 days in drug rehabilitation in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, said his trials have had a positive effect on his music. `` I've found a new spirituality to my music,'' he said. `` I feel I have never played better. I'm finding depth to my music I did n't think was possible.

 The last issue of the Rome-based daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Paese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sera </ORGANIZATION> appeared Saturday, just about two weeks shy of its 40th birthday. The failure of the Communist-controlled newspaper follows years of disputes between the management, the staff and the ownership consortium that included the printers and the Italian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Paese </PERSON> <PERSON> Sera </PERSON> did not say how many people would be put out of work by the closure, but the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Il </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tempo </ORGANIZATION> said it would leave 44 journalists and an unspecified number of other employees unemployed.

 A caterer whose plan to feed the hungry backfired on Thanksgiving has n't lost his spirit of giving, and said Saturday that he plans to make free meals at his banquet hall a regular event. It looked like <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostik </PERSON>, 40, was going to be stuck with hundreds of pounds of leftovers from a party planned for 900 needy people for which only 24 showed up. But a food bank came to his rescue, saying it would not let the food go to waste. `` It was the strangest Thanksgiving I've ever had,'' <PERSON> Kostik </PERSON> recalled on Saturday. More volunteers showed up to help serve the food than people to eat it. <PERSON> Kostik </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>, 40, found about 80 people to give food to Friday, but still had about 200 pounds of turkey, 210 pounds of potatoes, 60 cases of bulk corn and more than 200 pumpkin pies left. `` We gave them a couple of turkeys each and some pies. We loaded them up,'' <PERSON> Kostik </PERSON> said. `` We found the food bank as a result of all the media attention we got.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> will distribute the food to poor families, said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothermel </PERSON>, the group's executive director. <PERSON> Kostik </PERSON> said he mailed dozens of announcements about the feast, which cost him $ 1,000, to Pittsburgh-area newspapers and television and radio stations, but apparently none was used. Volunteers posted fliers throughout the neighborhood, but that did n't help much either. The only people who showed up were reporters who found out about the free party to which few came. `` I hung up on the first television station that called that afternoon. I did n't want them to make me any more depressed than I already was. I did n't want to watch my empty banquet hall on TV that night or read about it in the paper the next day,'' <PERSON> Kostik </PERSON> said. `` But the attention turned out to be a real good thing after all.'' <PERSON> Kostik </PERSON> thinks his use of the word `` needy'' on the fliers discouraged many people in his neighborhood from coming. `` We have a lot of ex-steelworkers here who have been unemployed a long time and a lot of senior citizens on fixed incomes. They're the kind of people who are too proud to ask for a handout,'' he said <PERSON> Kostik </PERSON> wants to try again. He plans to begin serving free meals at least once a month at the banquet hall. `` I'll probably do that starting in December _ maybe every other Tuesday _ for about 400 or 500 needy people,'' he said. But he'll probably rely on word of mouth to attract guests. `` On Friday, a lot of people told me if I do this again, they'll bring a couple of their neigbors who are in the same situation.

 More than 1,100 cyclists buzzed across the burning <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> on Saturday in a 135-mile, off-road motorcycle race that was marred by eleven injuries and has been opposed by environmentalists. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motorcyclists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> charged that someone had tried to litter the course between <LOCATION> Barstow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> with spikes. But the four-pronged spikes were dumped on a dummy course that had been set up to fool protesters, the organizers said. Saboteurs also moved some of the course markers, said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> of the association. `` They're nothing more than terrorists,'' <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said. `` When you change the course you can take riders over canyons, have them drop off of cliffs. The riders would have no knowledge of the course.'' <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schifferle </PERSON>, regional director fo the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said the annual race damages topsoil and releases tons of particulate matter into the air. `` We'd like to see this be the last race,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Schifferle </PERSON> said instructions for riders to stay on the course for safety and to avoid crushing endangered desert tortoises are just `` a few token bones tossed to the tortoise for a one-day joyride.'' The course was `` ugly,'' said rider <PERSON> Westly </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` It's real dusty, real rough and real short.'' The race staging area took on the look of a heavy-metal concert early Saturday with riders and their families, many clad in leather and chains, arriving before dawn for the race's 7 a.m. start. The whine of motorcycles reached earsplitting levels as the bikers revved up, and sand filled the air as the race got under way. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> said 1,144 motorcyclists and 4,000 to 5,000 spectators and crew members gathered for the event. `` It's a zoo, but I love it,'' said referee <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hales </PERSON>. Three racers suffered serious injuries and were taken to the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Irwin </LOCATION> military base hospital, <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxfield </PERSON> said. Eight lesser injuries, including dislocated elbows and knees and broken collarbones, were reported. Ms. <PERSON> Maxfield </PERSON> said the race generally took place without incident, although about 10 riders strayed off course near the beginning and rode into a wilderness study area. `` Other than that it seems to have gone very well,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Maxfield </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> officials went over the course both before and after the race and found no tortoises.

<HEAD>De Klerk Rules Out Transitional Government With Blacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 South African President <PERSON> Frederik </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has rejected the possibility of a transitional government that would include blacks while a new, non-racial constitution is being drafted, according to a published report. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, in his first newspaper interview since he became president in September, for the first time ruled out a central negotiating position presented by the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Sunday editions. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, the main black nationalist group fighting the government and a key bargaining partner in future negotiations, proposed that a multiracial interim government would share power during the process of drafting the new constitution. `` We are not prepared to move into a situation where a lawfully elected government will be suspended and interim governments will come about,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. However, he said that once a new constitution is negotiated with blacks under the supervision of the white government, the existing authority will have to accept it and give way to a new government. On other topics, de Klerk: _ Made clear that whatever new political order evolves, power in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would be shared on the basis of racially defined groups, not according to the principle of majority rules _ Ruled out the possibility of his government repealing the aprtheid law that categorizes every South African in a racial group at birth, saying the race law is `` fundamentally tied'' to the existing constitution and that its repeal would have to go hand-in-hand with the writing of a new constitution _ Said the release of imprisoned <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is under `` constant consideration,'' but declined to say when he would be freed _ Said he plans to lift the state of emergency `` as soon as possible,'' if not all at once, then in stages <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said, conveyed a sense of urgency in removing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 23 million blacks from the 4.5 million white minority rule, but said an expectation by some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials that the political system can be overhauled as early as next June is unrealistic. `` I think we are involved in a process,'' he said. `` I do n't think you can put a time scale to it `` If there is a conception that we will have a final solution in six months, I think that's an expectation we can not deliver.''

<TEXT>
 New opinion polls published Sunday showed Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and her governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in deep trouble with the voters. A Harris poll in The Observer indicated two-thirds of voters felt Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> should quit before the next general election, due by mid-1992. A survey by <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- MORI -RRB- in The Sunday Times reported the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> could win 51 percent of the vote, the highest figure since Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> came to power 10 years ago. The Conservatives would get 37 percent support and minor parties shared the remaining 12 percent. The figures mean that if an election took place now, the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> majority of 100 seats in the 650-seat <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> would be completely reversed in a Labor landslide. <ORGANIZATION> MORI </ORGANIZATION> also reported 23 percent of all Conservatives would like their leader to stand down. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON>, a former defense minister, was identified by 30 percent of all voters in the <ORGANIZATION> MORI </ORGANIZATION> survey as the Conservative leader they would prefer to take them into the next election, while Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> had the support of 22 percent, a reversal of their ratings two months ago. Both polls took place over two days last week among a national sample of nearly 1,100 voters who were interviewed. Neither survey reported any margin of error. The 64-year-old prime minister returned home on Saturday after talks on Friday with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at Camp David outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and a generally warm reception from Americans in contrast to feelings about her back home. Labor moved ahead of the Conservatives in the polls in the spring amid widespread dissatisfaction over rising inflation and intended changes in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has won three general elections and is the longest-serving <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prime minister in this century. As criticism of her leadership mounted within her party she said last week she was prepared to lead it into a fourth and even a fifth election. This week sees the first ballot for the Conservative leadership since Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> became leader in 1975. Sir <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, a constant critic of Cabinet policies and the only <ORGANIZATION> Tory </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker to oppose <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> going to war with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in 1982, said he will stand against her to test feeling about the leadership among his fellow legislators. They are the only party members entitled to vote on the issue.

 <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> puts its male statues on pedestals. The female images are displayed at street level, then the wits go to work at shredding what dignity remains. <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s bronze women are familiarly known as `` The Tart with the Cart,'' `` The Hags with the Bags,'' and `` The Floozie in the Jacuzzi.'' The statues, which have appeared in the past two years, are accessible, street-level images intended to make amends for the past male bias in the capital's public sculpture. The `` Hags,'' resting on a bench beside their bronze shopping bags at the foot of the Ha ` penny Bridge, are two anonymous The `` Tart'' is a well-built lass inspired by sweet <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, who `` wheeled her wheelbarrow, through streets broad and narrow, crying ` Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, o!'''

Ms. <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON>, a lecturer at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and head of the Women's Studies Forum, detected `` a sign of difficulty and fragmentation but also of possibility,'' and `` the singular diversities and diverse singularities of <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> women.'' `` Dubliners have appropriated the monument in their midst through a multiple re-naming game, manifestly pleasurable, which reverberates with a plurality of significations, often contradictory -LRB- but ` dreams go by contraries' -RRB- infinitely translating travesty,'' she explained. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Livia </PERSON> may be the most abused by the wits, but recent letters to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> indicate <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, who stands at the foot of the <LOCATION> Grafton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> shopping strip and opposite <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, is more controversial.

<HEAD>Striking Machinists Suffer Setback at Eastern, Win New Contract at
Boeing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Its tough stance was the same in both bruising battles, but for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> the outcomes of strikes against <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> could not have been more different. Eastern's Machinists are walking picket lines alone after being abandoned by pilots and flight attendants, who voted to return to work this past week after more than eight months on strike. At <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, however, their fellow <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> returned to work after ending a 48-day strike and gaining what is considered a strong new contract. `` It -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- was much more of a traditional collective bargaining experience, a much cleaner bargaining environment,'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, an independent labor arbitrator, said Friday. `` Eastern is at the other extreme ... It is n't just a matter of economics.'' The Eastern pilots' and flight attendants' decisions to end their strikes _ which were begun in sympathy with a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> strike on March 4 _ was a stinging blow to the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> and a key victory for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The hard-to-replace pilots had given the Machinists crucial support in their battle against <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and their walkout had virtually shut <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> down in the early days of the strike. At <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> struck alone, a much shorter walkout ended last Monday when 81.4 percent of the membership ratified the new 3-year contract. Although the union failed to get the full wage increase it sought, it scored other points _ including cost-of-living adjustments that will account for virtually all inflation. The 57,000 Machinists at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, the world's biggest commercial aircraft maker, had secure jobs to go back to. Their prosperous company, with a swollen backlog of orders, did n't attempt to continue full production during the strike. Many of the workers who struck financially troubled Eastern, on the other hand, have been replaced over the months as the financially sagging airline has rebuilt itself on a smaller scale under bankruptcy court supervision. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> warned the pilots and flight attendants unions Thursday that they wo n't necessarily get their old jobs back. The <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> also have been seeking higher wages, but the bitterly contested issues at the airline have gone beyond economics. Eastern's unions have demanded the removal of <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, charging him with trying to bust the union and draining assets from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to its sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The financial conditions and economics of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> _ as well as their unions _ also are vastly different. The 8,500 Eastern Machinists are about equally divided between two distinct groups: relatively skilled aircraft mechanics and less skilled ramp service workers, who fuel planes, handle baggage and drive motorized equipment on airport runways. After the strike began, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> was able to contract out much of the ramp service work. At <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, the union represents skilled production workers, who perform tasks ranging from riveting, wiring and plumbing in aircraft to quality inspections and machine-tool maintenance. Their skills make them difficult to replace. Another factor on the returning strikers may have been the pull of the holiday season. Both the Eastern and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers decided to end their walkouts the week of Thanksgiving. The prospect of holidays punctuated by continued struggles to make ends meet could not have been cheering for the employees and their families. In each case, there also was a specific catalyst that appeared to trigger the end of the strikes. At <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, the catalyst was President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto last Tuesday of union-backed legislation that would set up a blue-ribbon commission to investigate the dispute. That directly precipitated the action by the pilots and attendants. In the case of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, however, the catalyst seemed to work in the Machinists' favor. As some of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s big airline customers started to express public anxiety about further delays in jet deliveries due to the strike, the company appeared more pressed to make a deal with the union. In other business and economic news this past week: _ Economic reports pointed to continued sluggishness in the nation's manufacturing sector and a small inflationary spurt in October Orders for durable goods dipped 0.6 percent while the Consumer Price Index rose 0.5 percent. _ A number of major airlines announced plans to raise fares on most domestic routes and eliminate discount fares used mainly by business travelers _ Wall Street woes continued <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest retail brokerage, announced a restructuring that it said would include layoffs and other cost cutting, while <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it would cut stockbroker commissions for the first time in 15 years

<HEAD>Markets Get Boost From Federal Reserve</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wall Street analysts say the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> appears to have grown a bit more aggressive lately in its efforts to cushion the impact of a slowing economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> gave evidence just before the Thanksgiving holiday that it was taking further steps to relax its credit policy. For the second time this month, it engaged in maneuvers that encouraged a decline in short-term interest rates. The earlier easing did n't cause much of a stir, analysts say, partly because it did n't touch off any dramatic moves in the bank prime lending rate. But the latest actions by the central bank might `` make a bigger splash,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Schindewolf </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is trying to reduce general recession fears, the policy move in early November seems to have fallen short,'' he observed. `` In order to reach general psychology, the easing would need to grab the headlines.'' That may come soon, he suggested, in the form of a general reduction in the prime rate. Talk also has spread on the Street that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> might reinforce its message by lowering the discount rate, the charge it sets on loans to private financial institutions. The latest developments do n't necessarily signal that <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, has abandoned the gradualist style that has become his trademark, observers say. Nor do Wall Streeters think the central bank has dropped its campaign against inflation as economic enemy No. 1. But `` inflation _ the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s top priority _ is contained,'' said <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Recession risks have risen.'' If all goes right, analysts say, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will be able to bring off the much-ballyhooed `` soft landing'' for the economy as 1990 begins, letting interest rates fall and setting the stage for renewed expansion later on. But some doubts persist that it can achieve that tricky feat. `` Signs of a downturn are in view,'' contends <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinemann </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Ladenburg </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thalmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Mr. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has responded to the softening in the economy. He has also responded to heavy-handed pressure from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which is worried about the prospect of further Democratic gains in the congressional elections in 1990.'' Whatever the motivations, stock and bond traders found a lot to like in the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s latest actions. After getting off to a weak start, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 22.89 to 2,675.55 in the past week. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index gained 1.01 to 190.29, while the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market slipped .09 to 456.63 and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index fell .21 to 373.14. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 127.02 million shares a day during the holiday-shortened week, against 147.69 million the week before. `` The most recent economic reports confirm that business activity is slowing,'' said analysts at <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, investment management firm, in their latest appraisal of the outlook. `` A further easing of inflation pressures and lower interest rates appear to be reasonable expectations for the months ahead.'' That looks like a recipe for higher bond prices, at least among top-quality securities such as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds. But opinions remain sharply divided on what it might mean for the stock market. `` Corporate earnings are forecast to decline,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` We expect that earnings disappointments will increasingly overpower the interest rate downtrend as a determinant of stock prices, taking them lower in the process.''
