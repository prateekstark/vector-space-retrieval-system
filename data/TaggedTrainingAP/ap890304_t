 Every car should yield 42 miles per gallon and carbon dioxide emissions should be cut 20 percent to fight the `` greenhouse effect'' that may threaten Earth's climate and human health, a conference recommended Friday. Four hundred scientists and public officials from 13 countries attended the four-day Global Climate Change meeting that focused on the warming of the atmosphere and damage to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s protective ozone layer. `` The activities of 5 billion people on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> are clearly producing changes in the world's climate,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Harwell </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s Global Environment Program. `` In our lifetimes, and certainly in our children's, climate changes and other environmental impacts will profoundly affect the way humans live.'' The participants called for changes in human activities whose by-products are gases that may be causing a rise in atmospheric temperatures, resulting in hotter summers, droughts, more violent storms, rising sea levels and an increase in diseases. The participants urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass a more stringent version of the Clean Air Act, and to stop production by the year 2000 of all chlorofluorocarbons, which cause the `` greenhouse'' effect. They also recommended that the fuel economy of all new cars be increased by 1 -LCB- mpg per year to at least 42 mpg by the year 2000. Other energy sources, including nuclear plants, should be used more efficiently and with added safety standards, the participants said. The conference also urged that land use and building controls be enacted to provide for nature conservation, coupled with increased mass transit that would reduce automobile congestion. The conference was convened by Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, Gov. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Among those who addressed the meeting were physicist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON>; <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> cable network; Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, Jr., D-Tenn.; and Sen. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo The 150 scientists attending the meeting included <PERSON> Vassily </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Shijun </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the Environment. `` We must learn to understand and live rather than fight natural forces, including those unleashed by our own activities,'' said the participants in their final recommendation.

 A woman convicted of instigating her daughter's suicide by pushing her to work as a nude dancer will be allowed to profit from her story, a judge has ruled. `` I'm very happy,'' <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Thursday. `` I'm glad to get it over with.'' The agreement between the state and Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, approved Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franza </PERSON>, will require her to share whatever money she might get from her story with the state and with her 18-year-old son. Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Draves </PERSON>, estimated her client could receive between $ 50,000 to $ 200,000 for film and book rights to her story. Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 42, was convicted in October 1987 of child abuse, forgery and procuring a sexual performance by a child. She was sentenced to a year in jail but is free on bail during an appeal. Her 17-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancini </PERSON>, shot and killed herself in the family's <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> home in March 1986. During a two-week trial, state prosecutors claimed Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> traumatized her daughter by encouraging her to work as a nude dancer, even forging the girl's birth certificate to make it appear she was older. Lawyers said the case was the first in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in which a person was charged with mental child abuse in connection with a suicide. Originally, the state had sought to block Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> from getting any money, citing a never-before-used state law barring felons from profiting from depictions of their crimes. Under terms of Thursday's settlement, the state would receive about $ 35,000 for trial and jail costs from any earnings Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> receives from her story. Part of the remaining earnings would be shared by Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 18-year-old son. Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s former attorney, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON>, has his own claim pending against Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, contending he is owed $ 150,000 in attorney's fees from the trial, and he is seeking to overturn the agreement with the state. A hearing on that claim is scheduled for next week.

 A woman whose husband was slain at the convenience store where he worked said the company's insurer refused to pay the $ 138 hospital bill she incurred for treatment of shock after the killing. <PERSON> Georgianna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s insurance claim was returned unpaid last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Lewer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, the company most 7-Eleven stores use to provide health and life insurance for their employees. Mrs. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was shot to death Jan. 14 at a 7-Eleven store in nearby <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION> where he was night manager. Mrs. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellington </PERSON>, north of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, was treated for shock in the emergency room at <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> after his killing. The <ORGANIZATION> Lewer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said it was denying payment of the charges because the `` policy does not cover treatment of nervous and mental conditions.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who was covered under her husband's policy, said she was first dumbfounded then angry. `` Under the circumstances I expected without any question at all that this hospital bill would have been paid,'' she said Wednesday. `` It's not the money. It's the principle of how a company could do this to me. You give your life for your job and this is how you're treated in return.

 Former national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> became the first participant in the Iran-Contra affair to be sentenced, receiving a $ 20,000 fine and suspended prison term. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, placed on two-years' probation Friday for misleading <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about covert <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the Nicaraguan rebels, will be a key prosecution witness at the ongoing trial of his former aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. Leaving the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Courthouse with his wife, <PERSON> Jonda </PERSON>, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said the ordeal left him with `` strong faith and a terrific wife and a free country.'' `` I am looking to the future,'' he said. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> admitted he misled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by denying that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was helping the Contras raise money and transfer weapons when lawmakers had banned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. In a sentencing proceeding that lasted barely five minutes, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> must complete 200 hours of community service during his probabtion. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said `` the nature of the offense and the totality of the circumstances'' required him to impose a $ 20,000 fine. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> could have received a four-year prison term and a $ 400,000 fine for pleading guilty to four misdemeanor charges of withholding information from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel stood at ease with his hands clasped below his waist as he listened to the comments of his attorney, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Garment </PERSON> and the judge. `` The public servants in this country are not to be found to be more decent and more honorable,'' Garment said. `` Every action on his part ... was taken out of a high sense of duty, a strong sense of serving his country's interests.'' <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> accompanied North to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in May 1986 on an unsuccessful arms-for-hostages mission. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, by this time retired from government, carried a key-shaped cake and a Bible signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a show of good faith. In his emotionless voice, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said: `` Clearly, this episode in our history has rendered enormous turmoil on our country's processes `` To the extent that I contributed to that I regret it. I tried to serve my country.'' Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, who negotiated the plea agreement with <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> before <PERSON> North </PERSON> and three co-defendants were indicted last year, told reporters outside the courthouse his office had made no recommendation about the sentence. He refused to comment further. The sentencing took place on a day that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial had recessed for legal arguments. Former <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON>, who provided aircraft for the Nicaraguan rebels during the `` secret war'' that prosecutors say <PERSON> North </PERSON> waged after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> banned military aid, is scheduled to continue testifying when the trial resumes Monday. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> had asked to be sentenced before he took the witness stand against <PERSON> North </PERSON>. He pleaded guilty March 11, 1988, to charges that he misled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 by stating in three letters that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was not helping raise money for the Contras or providing military assistance. The letters were written to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> intelligence committee and the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the western hemisphere in response to queries about news reports that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was providing aid in defiance of the ban imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Among the 12 felony charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> are allegations that he made false statement to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by drafting the false letters that <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> signed. The defense contends that <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> should be held responsible for those letters, not <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who was below his boss on the chain of command. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> also admitted misleading the full <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in testimony after the Iran-Contra affair became public in later 1986 by denying knowledge of efforts to raise money from foreign governments to help arm the rebels.

 About the only clue the stocky, balding middle-aged man has about his past is the name `` <PERSON> Snuffy </PERSON>'' engraved on the back of his belt. He does n't know who he is, how he got to <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION> or anything before Feb. 8, when he awoke in a wooded area near <LOCATION> Shands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with no wallet and no form of identification. He is 5-foot-11, weighs 250 pounds and has a tattoo on his arm. He was wearing blue jeans, boots, flannel shirt and tinted prescription glasses when found. The hospital said brain scans and other evaluations showed no signs of a blow to the head or any other physical causes for amnesia, such as epilepsy or alcohol-related brain malfunction. Dr. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Shands </ORGANIZATION> psychiatrist, said the man is apparently suffering from a psychological form of amnesia, probably triggered by a great mental shock or stress. The man fears family members may be worrying about him somewhere. `` It took two or three days to sort of pull myself through the fog,'' the man said. `` I spend every waking moment trying to figure out who ... I am.'' The man, who is fairly articulate, speaks with a Southwestern accent and likes to read, sat with mental health counselor W.J. <PERSON> Tootie </PERSON> <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> and posed for pictures Thursday in hopes of a breakthrough _ someone who remembers what he ca n't. He said the name `` Snuffy'' does n't ring a bell for him. `` I did n't like it at first,'' he said, but `` it seems better than <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>.'' Ms. <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> said her client is able to talk and interact with people well. He has been reading voraciously, especially newspapers. The <LOCATION> Alachua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office has taken the man's fingerprints and physical description; there are apparently no warrants for his arrest There is a good chance that his memory will return, either in bits and pieces or a sudden rush, authorities said. Most similar amnesia victims regain most or all their memory within a few days or weeks. <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON> said forgetting an entire life is especially rare. The chances are `` you're going to find that there's something that this guy's getting away from,'' <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON> said. `` Whatever I'm responsible for, I want to live up to,'' said the mystery man.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> allies, struggling to gain the offensive in a tense confirmation battle, are suggesting that the defense secretary-designate come to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor and respond `` charge by charge'' to the allegations against him. `` If we owe Senator Tower anything, we owe him the right to say, ` I've had my day in court,''' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> GOP Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said Friday as <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>'s confirmation chances dimmed further with two additional Democrats joining the opposition. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> stopped short of turning his suggestion into a formal proposal, and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said he would be `` happy to consider any request.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> also said he was troubled by the confirmation proceedings, in which material from a confidential <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report that is damaging to Tower has been leaked in the news media but may not be discussed openly on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. He became the second senior Democrat in as many days to suggest a closed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> session to permit a full airing of the allegations contained in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report. Tower has been battling questions of his drinking habits, his behavior toward women and his lucrative work as a defense industry consultant after serving as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms control negotiator. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report contains numerous allegations, but Republicans say few if any of them are corroborated, and insist nothing in it disqualifies him from the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is in recess until Monday, when debate is expected to resume on the nomination, although Tower and several senators are certain to keep the controversy alive over the weekend with appearances scheduled on television interview programs. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> vote count shows 47 Democrats and GOP Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> either committed or leaning against the nomination and 40 Republicans committed or leaning in favor, with the rest undecided. The Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s surprise suggestion _ only six people have ever been called to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 200 years to answer charges against them _ came near the end of a day of debate in which two additional Democrats announced their opposition and a string of Republicans complained that Tower was being treated unfairly. `` We've got to even up the score somehow,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> GOP leader. Arguing that limitations on public references to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report make it impossible `` to get at the truth,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> suggested bringing Tower to the floor `` to answer his critics face-to-face, charge-by-charge, rumor-by-rumor and fact-by-fact.'' Several Republicans defended Tower earlier in a long day of debate. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has abandoned fairness and the object of that abandonment is <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said the evidence in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report was so flimsy that no prosecutor would use it for an indictment, and said of Tower, `` He is my friend. I thought he was your friend and I want some justice for my friend.'' Sen. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, R-Idaho. called on a few Democrats to swing behind the nomination before partisanship overwhelmed the debate completely, but the only two Democrats to announce _ conservative <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and liberal <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> _ said they would oppose confirmation. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> had been counted by the White House as a potential convert to Tower's cause, but in a written statement, he noted the allegations against Tower and said, `` We can not take a chance. An angry Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, called for the release of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report, noting the Republican charge that the Democrats have based their opposition on allegations, not facts. `` It's our character that's being assassinated here and I'm sick and tired of it,'' said <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>. Release of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report is a decision that only the White House can make.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is attempting to ease <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s financial crisis by providing the new government of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> with a $ 450 million `` bridge loan,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have disclosed. The South American nation saw its worst violence in 31 years, in a series of riots this week spawned by a series of price increases imposed as part of an economic reform program. An estimated 300 people died and 1,500 were injured in the disturbances, touched off by the new austerity program designed by <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> to cope with a $ 33 billion foreign debt. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Friday that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke Friday with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> in a telephone call, in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lauded <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s `` courageous and determined efforts'' to resolve its dire economic and financial problems. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had called <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> to express `` his concern for the recent difficulties'' in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. Two other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed later in the day that the a bridge loan was approved as a means of serving the country's short-term financial needs. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talked to him,'' one of the officials said. `` It's coming through,'' the official said of the loan. Both officials are familiar with the Venezuelan debt problem and were involved in discussions about the loan. The bridge loan will provide <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> with temporary relief because its depleted treasury has had difficulting meeting interest payments to commercial banks and other international lenders. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked about the reported loan, confirmed the two presidents discussed the issue in their phone call. But the spokesman said the matter was n't finalized and the `` many details'' had to be worked out. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has frequently provided bridge loans to other Latin American nations, such as <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, which had depleted treasuries. The austerity program was mandated by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> as a requirement for granting $ 4.3 billion in loans over the next three years. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> has taken steps to provide <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> with an immediate $ 450 million payment. Increases of 30 percent to 50 percent in public transport tariffs and price gouging by bus drivers set off the rioting, amounting to the worst violence in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> in 31 years. The nation of 18 million has been regarded as an island of tranquility amid a region of increasing violence, political stability and economic repression. The president's action was seen as another attempt to give <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s 29-day old administration some breathing room to deal with its financial woes. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> attended <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s Feb. 2 inauguration. The Venezuelan official was elected in a landslide Dec. 4. `` He reiterated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for their democracies and for President <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s courageous and determined efforts to address his country's economic and financial situation,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, when describing the call between the two presidents.

 The pigeons ignored plastic owls, traps and helium balloons; they were unruffled by high-frequency sound waves.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rejected a mediation board recommendation to use his authority under provisions of the Railway Labor Act and delay the strike for 60 more days. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also warned he would not tolerate sympathy strikes threatened by other unions to support the Machinists. Eastern wanted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to stay out of the dispute, saying either a strike, if it involved pilots, or postponement of the strike, would lead to bankruptcy. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> and 33 senators had asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene to prevent `` a major disruption of interstate commerce.''

 Eastern said it would slash up to 75 percent of its weekend flights, including most services from its <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> hub and about 60 other cities. The airline said earlier that it was prepared to operate during any strike and had contracted with 1,100 non-union mechanics to service planes. Eastern's pilots rejected an appeal Thursday by airline owner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> for them to sign a new contract and cross Machinists picket lines. Flight attendants said they would honor picket lines. Airports nationwide strengthened security and other airlines have reported surges in sales this week.

 Eastern obtained a federal court order and sent its machinists home, saying the action was intended to prevent sabotage. Machinists were given a paid holiday and told to return to work for shifts starting at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday, one minute after the strike deadline. Eastern said management personnel would handle ground duties for the rest of the day.

 Eastern's offer Thursday was rejected Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, and federal officials said they expected a strike at the midnight deadline as talks continued between the airline and the union. Eastern said the contract offered would reduce mechanics' pay but still keep their salaries 13 percent higher than employees who took a 20 percent pay cut when <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> took over in 1986. It said baggage handlers' cuts would be no greater than those of other employees. At 12:01 a.m., the Machinists went on strike.

<HEAD>US Agrees to Quicker Reduction in CFCs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is joining its <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies in pushing for elimination of all ozone-depleting chemicals by the end of the century, a sharp acceleration of the schedule for ending their use. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday he has asked the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to join the call to ban chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, by the year 2000 at an international conference that begins this weekend in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` Recent studies indicate the 50 percent reduction -LRB- of CFCs as provided by a 1987 treaty -RRB- may not be enough,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accounts for about one-third of the production of ozone-damaging chemicals, primarily CFCs, which are widely used as coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners and as a cleaning agent for electronic and computer equipment. Scientists have raised concerns about the chemical because it floats into the stratosphere before it breaks down, interacting with the gaseous veil of ozone that shields against the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Friday to take part in the conference to discuss ways to slow down ozone destruction. Representatives from more than 100 nations also will take part in the meetings being hosted by British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. In remarks to a group of high school science contest winners at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, the president said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will support the call `` for the elimination of CFCs by the year 2000 provided safe substitutes are available.'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, according to administration sources, had strongly recommended at a White House meeting Thursday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> join its European allies and call for the complete elimination of CFCs, as opposed to cutting production by 50 percent as required by current treaty. Many scientists have said that a 50 percent cutback would not be enough to protect against serious ozone depletion. On Thursday, the 12 nations of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> announced that they have agreed to a ban on the chemical in their countries by the end of the century. Sen. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., another members of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> conference, said Friday that even quicker action is needed because `` every year of delay implies an additional five to 10 years that these chemicals will remain in the atmosphere. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has called for elimination of all CFCs by 1994. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, ranking minority member of the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called the president's move `` very encouraging'' but also urged that CFCs be eliminated well before the year 2000. The 1987 treaty has been ratified by nearly 40 nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, most of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But it includes a provision that allows additional measures, including a complete ban, if further ozone damage is found. The parties to the treaty are scheduled to consider an accelerated phase-out schedule at a meeting in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, in early May. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> meeting, which begins Sunday, is described as a dress rehearsal for the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> session. According to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> produces roughly one-third of the world's CFCs, with E.I. <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> the world's largest producer. There were 750 million pounds of CFCs produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year and about the same amount in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Dupont </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Dupont </ORGANIZATION>, which accounts for about half of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production, has announced plans to stop making the chemical, perhaps as early as the mid-1990s and will begin to offer substitutes next year.

<HEAD>Feds Order Airlines To Check Boeing 747 Cargo Doors Within 30 Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> issued an emergency order on Friday, requiring all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to reinforce latch mechanisms on <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 cargo doors within 30 days, so the doors are less vulnerable to damage from improper closing. The emergency Airworthiness Directive, which speeds up the timetable of an earlier directive, also specifies special inspections and tests of the doors that must be done until modifications are completed. The action Friday follows the Feb. 24 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> accident near <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> in which a 10-by-20-foot hole was torn in a 747 fuselage. Nine people were swept to their deaths. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined, but the possible failure of the forward cargo door latch is under investigation. The door separated from the aircraft with parts of the fuselage that surrounded it. The 747 order affects about 150 airplanes. However, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Neale </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said some airlines have already made the required modifications, which include steel reinforcements to cargo door latches. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> issued a directive July 1 ordering the doors inspected and modified by the end of 1989 or July 1, 1990, depending on the type of locking mechanism installed. That order was issued after a cargo door on a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> 747 opened 1 -LCB- inches at the start of a flight from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said at the time the situation did not warrant an emergency directive. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> also said it soon would issue another Airworthiness Directive requiring improvements in the warning system that alerts flight crews when any cargo door is not properly closed and locked. The directive was expected as soon as the design improvements can be delivered and tested. There were similarities in the events on the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> planes. The cargo doors in both instances had to be closed by hand rather than electrically, after they had been malfunctioning. There were no warning lights to indicate whether the doors were open, said both flight crews. Additionally, the agency has formed a team to review all current <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> service bulletins on the 747 cargo door to determine whether instructions are complete and understandable, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said Friday in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. The team is focusing on the possibility of human error that might be associated with specific procedures. It is expected to complete its work within a week. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said changes made in the latest directive, from the July 1, 1988, order, included visual inspection of the cargo door latch before each flight, new torque limits on the door if it is closed manually, and shorter timetables for inspection for damage and of electrical systems. He said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> supported the action by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, and in fact had suggested in service bulletins of March and April 1987, the cargo door improvements that were included in the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s directive of July 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> also ordered immediate inspections of Dash 8-100 planes made by de Havilland of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, because faulty connections were found in fire-extinguishing systems on two of the Canadian-made Dash 8-100 airliners.

<HEAD>Bush Threatens Veto of Democratic Minimum Wage Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL PAGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is heading toward a confrontation with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> over sharply differing plans to raise the $ 3.35-an-hour minimum wage, with the possibility of the first increase in eight years in the balance. `` $ 4.25 is it,'' Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, warning that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would veto any attempt to fatten the hourly increase that the administration would phase in over three years. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said the raise to $ 4.25 must also be coupled with a sub-minimum `` training wage'' for the first six months employment for all newly hired workers. And she would expand the current exemption from the minimum to all small businesses. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan puts the administration at odds with Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and his bill to gradually raise the minimum to $ 4.65 an hour There are slightly fewer than 4 million people working for the minimum wage, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The $ 3.35 floor has not been raised since 1981. Since then, said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, inflation has cut the purchasing power of that wage by 40 percent. The Labor committee will begin considering the minimum next week, and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> says he would like to bring it to a vote by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by the end of the month. But Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s veto warning on Friday _ what <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> termed a `` take it or leave it'' _ set the stage for a battle like the one last year when <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s increase failed because of opposition by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told the Labor panel that any rise in the minimum wage will cost the nation jobs and that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s plan would mean 650,000 jobs lost. She said the administration's increase of 30 cents a year for three years would balance lost jobs with higher earning power for low-income workers. `` Any more expansive approach at this time would be unacceptable, because it would decrease job opportunities,'' she told the committee. `` Legislation outside those parameters would call for a veto,'' she said. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> told Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> that if a veto threat is part of the administration's proposal `` then we're laying right out for a confrontation ... I hope we're not getting a take or leave it.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> answered, `` The president has signed up for $ 4.25 an hour, and not higher.'' `` $ 4.25 is it,'' she said, waving her hand. Under the `` training wage,'' all workers hired at the minimum could be paid $ 3.35 an hour for six months before they are covered by the higher standard, whether or not it is their first job. There are no limits such as age on that exemption. The administration would also expand the tax credit for tips from the current 40 percent to 50 percent. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, noting cost-of-living increases for government workers, those in the military and others, said `` those at the end of the economy ought to get it, too.'' The administration proposal was attacked by the business community after the committee hearing. `` A higher minimum wage would deny access to the first rung on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s job ladder or those entering the work force _ the very people the increase is meant to help,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>'s employee relations policy center.

<HEAD>Man Defense Calls Mentally Retarded Given Stay of Execution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Friday blocked the execution of a man after a defense attorney argued that the condemned man was mentally retarded and did not understand his rights when he was arrested. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairchild </PERSON>, 34, was scheduled to die by injection on Wednesday for the 1983 beating, rape and murder of a 22-year-old nurse. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisele </PERSON> ordered the stay after a two-hour hearing. Defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> cited intelligence tests Fairchild had taken which indicated that his client is mentally retarded. `` I knew the stay would be granted. I got the test results at 10 this morning,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said Friday. The attorney general's office said it would not appeal the stay to the 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Eisele </PERSON> set a hearing for March 16 to determine if Fairchild had the mental capacity to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of his action when he waived his so-called Miranda rights after he was arrested. He signed and initialed the waiver, according to testimony at his trial. The Miranda rights include the suspect's right to keep silent; to be informed that anything he says may be used against him; to have an attorney present when he is questioned by police; and to have an attorney appointed for him free if he can not afford to hire one. Questioned about what his Miranda rights were, Fairchild described them during the hearing as `` remain silent, whatever say can be used against you, right to call a lawyer.'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said Fairchild is easily led to give particular answers, even though he does not realize the implications of what he is doing. He may not realize what it means for something to be used against him, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. Psychologist <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> testified for the defense that on the basis of testing Thursday at the prison, she would place Fairchild's IQ in the range of 56 to 64, which is considered mentally retarded. The IQ statistic differs from the previous figure that was determined after a 1986 test that said his IQ was 87, which is dull-normal.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s offer to help cool the furor over the novel `` The Satanic Verses'' seems a careful attempt to balance its interests in improving relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the West and its own burgeoning Moslem population. The Soviets have defended <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> without condoning the campaign to kill the book's author. As 15 Western nations withdrew their top diplomats from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to protest <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death threat against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> edged closer to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> while seeking to ease the uproar. `` We need calm,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said Thursday as he greeted his Spanish counterpart. `` The less emotion the better for all at the present period. We have to extinguish -LRB- the fire -RRB- because nobody needs a fire.'' The Soviets have not revealed how the dispute could be resolved, but with an increasingly restive Moslem population of 50 million in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, they can ill afford a misstep. At first, Soviet officials declined comment on the dispute, although <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was then visiting the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on his itinerary. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> ordered his followers Feb. 14 to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, a naturalized British citizen, because of his book. Moslems say the book is blasphemous and Iranian clergymen have offered a $ 5.2 million bounty for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s death. After <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> discussed the dispute with Iranian officials during a three-day trip to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> that ended Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said: `` The government of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is sincere about finding a settlement of the situation that has emerged, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could have a positive role to play.'' In elaborating the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s middle-ground position, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that Western countries were justified in their `` indignation'' over <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s threat. But, the news agency added: `` Perhaps Imam <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the supreme religious authority in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, had no choice proceeding from Koran teachings, other than denouncing a man who has insulted Islam.'' `` The denunciation was nothing more, by the way, than the position of a religious leader. The Iranian government has not condemned <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> to death,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, even though <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> officials have supported the threat. The sympathy toward <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s religious concerns was unusual in light of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s advocacy of atheism, but reflected sensitivity to its own Moslem population. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s Moslem population is growing much more rapidly than ethnic Russians who hold the reins of political power. Based on current trends, the Moslem population will rise to 100 million by the year 2000, meaning one in every three Soviets will be a Moslem. Soviet Moslems were unhappy when the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> moved into neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to fight Moslem rebels. Siding with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> dispute would have angered Soviet Moslems further at a time when they are becoming increasingly vocal. On Feb. 3, Moslems massed in the Uzbek capital of <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> to demand the ouster of their religious leader because, they said, he was not following religious law and was a pawn of the state. He later resigned and Moslems are to choose a new leader March 14-15. In other signs of new sensitivity to Moslems, the government has promised to open more mosques and expand an Islamic seminary. After <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s meetings in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> sought to play down <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death threat even though the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had asked him to `` raise concerns with the Iranians'' and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> urged him to press <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to back off. For <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, however, further improving relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> carried the day. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> once lumped the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> together as `` The Great Satan.'' In a sign of the changing times, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> became the highest ranking Soviet to visit <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since its 1979 Islamic revolution. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have improved markedly since it began allowing Moslems more religious freedom and withdrawing its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, gratified by the Afghan pullout, signed an agreement in December to supply the Soviets with natural gas. Trade is growing between the countries, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is helping rebuild areas of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> devastated in its 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Aside from bringing it closer to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the Soviet offer of mediation in the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair serves a wider foreign policy goal. It is in line with President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` new political thinking,'' which seeks to avoid confrontation and stresses compromise and cooperation. The Soviet tabloid Arguments and Facts said Friday the affair opens a peacemaking opportunity for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` In such cases, more than ever, assistance is needed from a party that can take a sober view of things, to help both sides get out of the difficult situation they created,'' the newspaper said. Spanish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON>, who met Thursday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> mediation effort had not yet begun. `` There was no proposal concerning an intermediary role,'' he said Friday. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> is slated to discuss the issue next week in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Union mechanics and baggage handlers struck <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> at midnight Friday after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to order an emergency 60-day cooling-off period and union officials rejected a last-ditch company proposal. Negotiations continued up to the deadline. But shortly after midnight, federal mediator <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> told reporters, `` We have not been successful in reaching agreement. `` <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is officially on strike as of midnight,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 100. `` It's shut down. PIcket lines went up around the country and pilots immediately pledged to support the strike. `` We voted unanimously to honor the picket lines,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` That means as far as I'm concerned the Eastern pilots are directed as of this moment not to fly Eastern airplanes. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> of Eastern blamed the strike on the union's insistence on an 8 percent increase when the airline's others unions accepted a 20 percent wage cut three years ago `` This has to do with a union that has decided that it is not going to join with the other employees at Eastern who have made the sacrifices they've made,'' he said. <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would continue flying, albeit at a reduced schedule that he said was set to `` make sure people could have continued confidence in Eastern.'' The strike was called after <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> made a new offer to the union that company officials said protected past wage increases and job security for 8,500 union aircraft mechanics and baggage handlers. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said the talks between the two sides ended on a `` professional if not cordial'' note and that both sides were free to resume negotiations at any time. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in an unprecedented action, earlier Friday had rejected a recommendation from federal mediators to order an emergency 60-day cooling-off period. Thirty-three senators and national labor leaders also had urged him to name an emergency panel, a move that would have averted a strike for at least 60 days. The financially strapped airline said it opposed federal intervention. Details of the company's last offer were not disclosed, although <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> vice president, said it `` addresses the -LRB- union -RRB- concerns.'' The union earlier Friday rejected a company proposal that would have cut mechanics' pay by 15 percent and baggage handlers' wages by 26 percent. A federal judge, meanwhile, ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> machinists could set up pickets against other airlines, but he prohibited <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union members at those airlines from joining the strike. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> officials had said members of all unions should honor the secondary pickets. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, speaking to reporters outside a hotel where talks were under way, said of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s initial offer Friday, `` The other side evaluated it and rejected it ... It was a fizzle.'' Eastern on Thursday had offered to reduce the size of the wage takebacks it has been demanding for the past 17 months from 8,500 members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. The first offer Friday would have reduced hourly top-scale wages from $ 18.83 to $ 16 for aircraft mechanics and from $ 15.60 to $ 11.54 for baggage handlers. In a non-strike action that could put pressure on all the nation's airlines, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> announced that in the event of an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> strike, it would instruct its 40,000 members beginning next Tuesday to precisely adhere to flying procedures that would cause `` substantial delays'' at the nation's airport. Eastern said it would operate despite a walkout in an effort to trim by $ 150 million a year the wages paid to members of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a statement released at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has for many months attempted unsuccessfully to bring the parties to an agreement, and I have no reason to believe that an additional investigation or the 60-day delay that would be entailed would produce such an agreement.'' He warned union officials against `` disrupting the nation's transportation systems through secondary boycotts'' against other airlines or transportation companies <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that if strikes against other transportation outlets occur, he will seek emergency legislation to stop them. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told a news conference Friday that <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> inspections of Eastern were already being increased. `` Eastern's service will be on planes that are safe and airworthy, and ... we will not tolerate any threats of sabotage or other forms of physical harm that threaten the health and safety of people on the ground or in the air,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. The union has said it has no plans for any such actions or threats. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said, in answer to a question, that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> retained the power to call the emergency panel and prevent a strike _ even after the deadline _ but he indicated that was unlikely. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could also invoke the emergency panel provision of the act. A panel would examine the dispute for 30 days and report to the president. A 30-day cooling-off period would follow before the company or union could take any action affecting jobs. Eastern had said earlier that either a strike, if it involved pilots, or presidential intervention delaying the strike, would likely lead to bankruptcy. The company, which flies 100,000 passengers a day with more than 1,000 flights, says it is losing $ 1 million a day and has lost $ 1 billion over the past decade. Pilots and flight assistants have said they will refuse to work behind Machinists picket lines. As the strike deadline approached, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> sent <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union members home for a paid vacation day. The airline acted after telling a federal judge that the union planned last-minute sabotage that threatened passenger safety. `` This is not a lockout and is not an attempt to affect the bargaining,'' said airline spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>. In <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> said he was ruling that <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union members at other airlines could not honor Eastern machinists' picket lines there `` in view of the fact that there are no-strike clauses, no-slowdown clauses'' in their contracts with the other airlines. During the hearing, the attorney for <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinnert </PERSON> said the two airlines `` are total strangers to the dispute ... and we want to keep it that way.'' Also included at the hearing were representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>.

 The Secret Service is having a difficult time recruiting minority group members because it ca n't keep up with salaries offered elsewhere, the agency's director says. `` If I were a minority getting out of college, I would be heavily recruited by <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and all the major corporations,'' <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and General Government on Friday. And the problem is n't just limited to minority recruitment, he said. `` We're offering $ 18,000 to incoming agents,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is starting in the vicinity of $ 33,000.'' One agent who had been with the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for three years recently left to take a job with the <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police force in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where he'll earn $ 55,000 a year, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` You train them for other places,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON>, D-Md. `` You're the farm team.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency which protects the president, the vice president and presidential candidates, among others, will face a crisis when the next president campaign rolls around, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` In 1992, when one-third to one-quarter of our law enforcement personnel will be eligible to retire, the potential applicant pool of men and women between the ages of 21 and 30 will be at its lowest point since World War II,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` Without the ability to attract and retain their replacements now, the future of our operations is very seriously threatened.'' <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> uniformed officers, whose jobs do n't require college education, begin at $ 23,000, but their salaries ca n't eventually increase as much as those of actual agents, who must have college degrees, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said in an interview after the hearing There are about 1,950 agents and 1,000 uniformed officers in the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>, indicated his bureau faces the same situation because of starting salaries of $ 15,000 to $ 18,000. Ms. <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON> noted: `` They start at the same level as a paralegal in the office of attorneys defending the drug dealers.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION>, a panel created at the urging of subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, D-Ariz., is considering calling for salary increases for the officers, the senator said Such a decision would have to be made by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, so the budget requests for the agencies for fiscal 1990, the topic of the subcommittee hearing, did not include money for increasing salaries. The <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> request for fiscal 1990 is $ 368.4 million, an increase of $ 10.9 million over 1989. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> noted that in the year after a presidential election, `` historically, your budget requests are down.'' Asked why the budget request had increased this year, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said some of the campaign protection funds for last year's election had been distributed to the agency in advance of fiscal 1989, and the elimination of non-recurring costs was not enough to offset inflation. `` In order to stay ahead of the bad guys, you have got to have some flexibility in the budget,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> bureau did not include a specific budget request during the hearing.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> set the first national minimum wage at 40 cents an hour in 1938 with the Fair Labor Standards Act.

 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> situation. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has recommended that I appoint an emergency board before March 4, pursuant to section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, to investigate the dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. I have decided not to accept this recommendation.

In light of the well-publicized threats of a strike and related activities, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> will monitor the situation and will in addition take whatever steps are needed to protect the safety of the traveling public. I urge responsible labor officials not to try to influence resolution of this dispute by disrupting the nation's transportation systems through secondary boycotts against uninvolved parties. Such boycotts would unfairly burden millions of citizens, not only preventing necessary travel, but also affecting shipment of consumer goods and the ability of many workers to earn a living. For these reasons, secondary boycotts are not permitted in any other sector of the economy. Accordingly, if secondary boycotts threaten to disrupt essential transportation services, I will submit, and urge that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> promptly enact, legislation making it unlawful to use secondary picketing and boycotts against neutral carriers. We can not allow an isolated labor-management dispute to disrupt the nation's entire transportation system.

<HEAD>Navy Laser Succeeds in Key Test</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A laser weapon shot down a supersonic target last week in a test that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> hailed as proof the experimental weapons can be used against cruise missiles. The service said Friday the classified test was conducted Feb. 23 at the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, Missile Range using a laser that is being tested both by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the `` Star Wars'' program. The test was an extremely important one, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said, because `` for the first time a high-energy laser system successfully engaged and destroyed a ... missile flying low and fast in a cruise missile profile.'' Never before had the laser been tested against a target flying faster than the speed of sound, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. The laser `` destroyed a supersonic missile in a test designed to show that a laser system could acquire, track and deposit enough energy on a supersonic target to destroy it,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> continued. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> released an unclassified videotape of the experiment. The tape shows the target missile flying across the desert floor, then just a brief, sharp burst of light near its tip that sends it out of control. The laser used in the test, nicknamed MIRACL for Mid-Infrared Advanced Chemical Laser, proved for the first time in the fall of 1987 that it could shoot down a target flying below the speed of sound. A jet-powered drone was used in those tests. In the latest experiment, the laser was fired against an old TALOS anti-aircraft missile that was flying more than two times the speed of sound _ or roughly 1,500 miles per hour _ on a path meant to simulate that of an attacking cruise missile, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. Unlike the Star Wars organization, which has been investigating the feasibility of laser weapons to shoot down ballistic nuclear missiles in space, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has been experimenting with MIRACL to see if such a laser could reliably defend a warship against missile attack. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> program is known as the Balanced Technology Initiative.

 Airports, railroads and seaports nationwide braced Friday as <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' Machinists went on strike, a walkout that threatened secondary action against the nation's transportation system. Airports that handle heavy Eastern traffic boosted police patrols, designated picket areas and mapped contingency plans to keep operations running normally after the Machinists went on strike at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday. Machinists quickly established that they intended to shut <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> down, storming the gate at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Police in riot gear helped push them back. At approximately 12:10 a.m., the 3,400 Eastern pilots voted overwhlemingly to honor the Machinists strike. J. B. `` Skip'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said early Saturday: `` We will honor their picket.'' Referring to the pilots who do n't honor the picket line, he said `` a shadow would be cast over them for perhaps the rest of their careers at Eastern.'' Negotiations between the airline and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> collapsed despite an undisclosed offer by the carrier at 10 p.m., two hours before the deadline, and Machinists' officials offering to extend talks at the mediators' request. Defensive activities were especially evident at airports in south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s home region. Security also was beefed up at many airports, including <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> Preparations took on new urgency Friday afternoon when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced he would not intervene in the bitter labor dispute _ an action that would have stalled a strike by triggering a 60-day cooling-off period. Eastern cut up to three-quarters of its weekend flights on Friday, including most out of its <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> hub and nearly 60 other cities. The airline planned to maintain service to almost 50 cities, including most flights out of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle and Latin American routes. Other carriers moved in to pick up some of the slack. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said it would add two or three flights per hour on its shuttle service from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to both <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washigton </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> said it would consider adding flights from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> hub to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> points south. It planned to honor Eastern tickets, with certain conditions. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said they would honor some Eastern tickets but planned no additional service. Greyhound Lines said it planned expanded bus service beginning Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> said it would add 12 daily trains between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In the event of a secondary strike, the rail line said it would attempt skeleton service run by supervisors. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> carries 33,000 passengers on 108 trains a day in the Northeast corridor and 28,000 daily passengers elsewhere. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> said the national passenger railroad could continue limited operations for only a few days if picketed by workers supporting an Eastern strike. A recording on a <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> station telephone line in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, said, `` The effect of an Eastern strike is uncertain. Our current plans are to operate a normal schedule.'' The recording began by stating that lines were tied up because of the anticipated strike. National union leaders and locals threatened to disrupt transportation around the country in sympathy with the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, general chairman of District 100 of the Machinists, said there was a `` good possibility'' union members at <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> would strike if the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> walked out. In metropolitan <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, freight railroads and commuter lines that carry about 320,000 people into <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> each day expected to be hit by a secondary strike. `` It looks like a very bad situation,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, parent agency of the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commuter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>. Extra buses were ordered to shuttle passengers from outlying suburbs in western <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and the northern suburbs to subway terminals in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> established telephone hotlines to help commuters find alternative routes and subway connections. The city <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> said it would put extra traffic agents at busy intersections and activate all tow trucks to deal with an anticipated surge in traffic. At the port of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, port officials and cruise line representatives made contingency plans for an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 booked passengers who would be unable to get to cruise ships or return home if Eastern flights were disrupted. At <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, adjacent to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate headquarters, extensive preparations were made to maintain airport operations and `` protect the public's right of access to the airport,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Amalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. `` Things are very quiet right now,'' she said Friday afternoon. `` The airport is operating. We have increased police presence as planned, the staffing is increased in all areas and will continue throughout the weekend until we see what happens,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s second-largest operating location with 6,700 employees, picket lines went up outside the Eastern maintenance hangar after machinists were sent home with pay and the gate to the maintenance area was locked. Union members set up a strike tent across the street from the gate and police set up barricades nearby.

 The <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear power plant could have an operating license in about a month, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said after the commission ejected the affected state and local governments from its proceedings. The commission voted 4-0 Friday to remove the governments of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and the Town of <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION> on the grounds they `` willfully defied'' commission orders to produce documents and witnesses at licensing hearings. The federal action was unprecedented in more than 30 years of overseeing the nuclear industry. <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said there are no further roadblocks to licensing the $ 5.4 billion plant on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` If everything were to go well, I suppose in a month would be the earliest'' for licensing, he said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> vowed an appeal in federal court. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> seeks to deny the state and local governments our statutory right to protect the health and safety of our citizens,'' he said in a statement. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s position is absurd. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the plant, were predictably pleased by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> decision. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> has proclaimed clearly and definitely that <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> is a safe plant,'' said <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonnell </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> announced Feb. 28 they had reached an agreement under which the utility would sell the plant to the state for $ 1 and it would be dismantled by the state power authority. In return, <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> would be eligible for rate increases which have yet to be specified. Friday's ruling has clearly put <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> in a better position to hold out for the highest rate increases it can get under the shut-down agreement. <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> has also retained the right to continue seeking an operating license but agreed not to operate the plant even if one is granted, as long as all necessary approvals of the pact are in place by April 15. The state and local governments had stalled licensing of the reactor by refusing to participate in an emergency evacuation plan. They contended that the area around the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> plant could not be evacuated in the event of an accident.

<HEAD>Officials Say Nuclear Reactor Mishap Won't Delay Restart Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Investigators of a nuclear weapons plant accident in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> have concluded that measures needed to prevent a recurrence will not delay plans for resuming production there of a radioactive gas used in nuclear warheads. The investigators, in a report released by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, blamed the Jan. 22 accident on `` significant and longstanding weaknesses'' in operations at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>, which includes three nuclear reactors. The reactors are owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and run by a private contractor. The report said the troubles at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>'s K reactor, where the accident occurred, are symptomatic of problems throughout the complex that must be corrected before the reactors resume production of tritium, a gas needed in the manufacture of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nuclear arms. All three reactors have been shut down since last spring, crippling the nuclear weapons production program. A restart of the K reactor has been planned for late this year, with the two other reactors to resume operation in 1990. There had been concern that the Jan. 22 accident might delay the restart schedule. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said that unless tritium production were resumed by the end of the year, the nation's nuclear arsenal could be put in jeopardy. `` We do not see any significant schedule delay as a result of this,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sjostrom </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> health and safety official said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. He was one of the official investigators. <PERSON> Sjostrom </PERSON> said the department still expected to announce a specific restart schedule for the K reactor sometime this month. He said he could not be more specific. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said operators of the reactor and its support systems were unprofessional and lacking in discipline. It blamed their managers for this. The conclusions of the 131-page report go to the heart of safety, technical and managerial problems at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> that have virtually shut down the complex. Several valves in K reactor's backup cooling system were damaged in the accident, but because there was no fuel in the reactor, the health and safety of plant workers and the general public were not in danger, the report said. The problem began when a pipe valve was inadvertently left open before the start of the cooling system test. This prevented the usual buildup of pressure in the pipes during the test. Instead of halting operations to determine the cause of the problem, du Pont technicians pumped more water into the pipes. This caused the open valve to slam shut with extraordinary force, creating what is called a `` water hammer'' that damaged several other valves. A final assessment of the extent of damage has not yet been completed, officials said. The investigators' report was strongly critical of the <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> I. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> management team that runs the reactor complex under an Energy Department contract. It also criticized plant operators and <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials on the site. `` The investigative team reached a consensus that this event was a direct result of significant and longstanding weaknesses that continue to exist in the conduct of plant operations,'' the report said. The investigators cited du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s initial report of the incident, which happened on a Sunday. The company's report was a routine accounting of what had taken place at the plant over the weekend. It said there had been `` no incidents,'' while later mentioning the reactor accident only briefly. The du Pont report included 10 `` events.'' Listed ahead of the reactor accident were such things as the spilling of one quart of diesel fuel and an operator falling off his chair.

 Skinheads and white supremacists refused to back down from a rally on a private ranch today, but they abandoned plans for a whites-only `` Aryan Woodstock'' rock concert that a judge said required a permit. `` We can sing, we just ca n't play instruments,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Heick </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> head of a white supremacist group called <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> who represented concert organizers in court Friday. `` I'm not angry,'' he said. `` I expected this, obviously.'' <ORGANIZATION> Napa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON>, describing the issue as `` politically and emotionally charged,'' deemed the event a public gathering. He issued a restraining order prohibiting the concert because organizers had failed to obtain a permit required by county ordinance. But <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON> allowed a public gathering, rejecting the county's argument that the assembly would be a public nuisance and saying it `` demonstrated no clear and present danger to the public. Six skinheads linked arms around <LOCATION> Heick </LOCATION> and escorted him out of the courthouse, using lighted cigarettes to make their way through a throng of reporters. <PERSON> Heick </PERSON> vowed to `` get a concert going'' elsewhere. Leaders of the groups said they would gather today to party and discuss their `` white liberation movement.'' The site is a private ranch about 40 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The physican who owns the land and leased it for the gathering said he was told the meeting was to be about environmental concerns. The skinhead subculture and style of dress emerged in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in the 1960s. Segments of the movement later took on Nazi overtones and since have been associated with the white supremacist groups. County attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Westmeyer </PERSON> said the ruling did n't surprise him, adding that it might prompt the county Board of Supervisors to change the law. `` I think -LRB- they -RRB- may consider revising the ordinance to apply to large public gatherings, rather than just rock concerts,'' he said. Before the hearing, an <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> official warned that the gathering was an effort to win support for an unpopular cause which advocates racial violence. However, Regional Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> would not `` dignify the existence of this group or their planned event with our presence tommorrow.'' `` We can ignore a rock concert by skinheads, but we can not ignore what they represent in terms of potential danger,'' he added. The Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and the anti-crime <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> civilian patrol group indicated they would demonstrate at the rally. <PERSON> Heick </PERSON>, who sports 16 tattoos, including SKINS inked inside his lower lip, said during Friday's hearing that, `` Our intention was to comply with the law.'' He said a check with the county some time ago indicated no permit was needed. `` In no way would we want a public event,'' he said. `` We wanted to keep out of people's way, where we could all be alone and have a little party.'' The concert was to feature skinhead bands Midtown Boot Boys from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, the Hammerheads from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hakenkreuz </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Organizer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> leader and currently head of a group called <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, argued earlier that since the concert was to be held on private property and admission was by invitation only, no permit was needed. Although <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON> earlier had predicted as many as 2,000 people might attend the concert, <PERSON> Heick </PERSON> on Friday said he expected about 200 attendees.

The walkout instantly disrupted Easter flights at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, the airline's headquarters. One of the first Eastern post-strike flights, about to depart for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, was canceled after the flight crew walked out at midnight. `` They say there's another <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flight,'' said passenger <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, 51. `` But I'm going to try to get my ticket endorsed for another airline. I've been traveling for 3 -LCB- days and I'm too tired to wait around.'' From <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, carloads of pickets careened into airports by the midnight deadline, reporters for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in those areas said. At <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, an important Eastern hub, the last <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flight arrived at 11:57 p.m. from <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> and passengers were clearly relieved. Three others scheduled to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> were canceled. The strike capped an emotional 17-month feud between the union and Eastern that has come to symbolize the problems faced by one of the nation's largest and most unprofitable airlines. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, about 3,000 workers charged across the street from the local union hall to corporate headquarters, chanting and carrying placards. Some hurled rocks, bottles and concrete blocks over the barbed wire-topped fence. They tore up effigies of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, the hard-line boss who bought Eastern three years ago. Riot police turned back some workers who tried to storm Eastern gates. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said some union members apparently did crash through gates, but he had no details. `` Estamos en huelga! -LRB- We are on strike! -RRB-,'' shouted union local aide <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Urra </PERSON>, speaking in Spanish. Later, he added: `` It's a shame. It could have been avoided.'' Police cars with sirens screaming and some officers in riot gear took their places at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s airport and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> implemented strike contingency plans it said could keep the carrier flying `` indefinitely.'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said a proposal made less than two hours before the strike deadline guaranteed job security for the 8,500-member union. But union members said the company offered scant improvements over its demand for $ 150 million in wage concessions. <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Haber </PERSON>, a Machinists general chairman, reported strong support from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots and flight attendants and predicted support from other unions across the nation. `` It's no longer a fight between Machinists and Eastern. It's a fight between labor and corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Haber </PERSON> said. In a related action, the <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> announced its 40,000 members next Tuesday would begin to precisely follow flying procedures, causing `` substantial'' airport delays. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> has urged all members to honor picket lines and the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> have vowed to picket trains, ports and other airlines. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s chief operating officer, said the carrier slashed weekend flights by up to 75 percent but could keep flying. Service will be maintained to about 50 cities, including most flights from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and on the airline's <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle and Latin American routes, he said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> at other airlines could not honor Eastern machinists' picket lines in view of no-strike, no-slowdown clauses'' in their contracts with other carriers White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told a news conference the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` will monitor the situation and will, in addition, take whatever steps are needed to protect the safety of the traveling public.'' Eastern said it had contracted with 1,100 non-union mechanics to service its planes. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said Eastern could fly indefinitely with 200 management pilots and those who cross picket lines if pilots honor a walkout. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> the Machinists were sent home early in the day after a federal judge said it was necessary to ensure passenger safety. He denied it was a lockout move. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s refusal to invoke an emergency mediation panel and impose a 60-day cooling-off period in the 17-month-old dispute marked his first major labor-crisis decision. To Eastern's machinists it signaled a major dimming of hope. `` The reaction here is we would just as soon get it over with,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacino </PERSON>, a Machinists general chairman. `` Our people are pumped up; they're ready. War has been declared.'' The airline, which says it is losing $ 1 million a day, has been seeking $ 150 million in concessions from the Machinists, the union that includes mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground workers. Eastern flies about 100,000 people a day with an average of 1,040 daily flights. It has 250 airliners. The 60-year-old, Miami-based carrier, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, wanted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to stay out of the dispute, claiming it could not afford any delay. Eastern's pilots rejected an appeal Thursday by <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> for them to sign a new contract and cross Machinists picket lines. Eastern flight attendants said they would honor picket lines, although <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> _ who in 1983 took <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy reorganization to end a labor confrontation _ has warned that the action could land Eastern `` in the corporate graveyard.'' Airports nationwide strengthened security and made contingencies for dealing with the strike. Other airlines, some of which have declined to promise to honor Eastern tickets, have reported surges in sales this week. `` We will do our best to assist <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> passengers should there be a work stoppage,'' stated <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, which arranged to accept Eastern tickets. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said the company had experienced `` significant amounts of vandalism'' and got permission from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to send workers home. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said it was necessary for passenger safety. Workers were given a paid holiday and told to report back to work at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, one minute after the strike deadline, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said the company had reliable information that Machinists planned at midnight to deploy emergency chutes on all Eastern planes, threatening equipment and causing lengthy flight delays. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortis </PERSON>, Machinists Local 702 vice president, denied the claim. `` Our people are professionals. There is no sabotage,'' <PERSON> Ortis </PERSON> said while hundreds of union members wearing black T-shirts, some with skull-and-crossbones warnings to `` scab'' strike replacement workers, awaited news at the local union near Eastern corporate headquarters. The company contended that <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> set at least four fires in recent days at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s Hartsfield International Airport. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> ruled there was `` credible evidence'' that at least one fire was set by Machinists, beneath a concourse at <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. The Machinists vowed to picket other airlines, ships and railroads, and <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> officials have said they want their 14 million members to support the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, a federal judge on Thursday issued an order barring <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' 21,000-member Machinists' union from staging a sympathy strike in the event of a walkout, pending a March 13 hearing.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western nations are putting together emergency loans to help <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> weather an economic crisis that sparked nationwide riots and the deaths this week of at least 300 people. President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> on Friday linked the bloodiest civil unrest in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s history to the burden of its foreign debt. He said debt payments threaten the newest democracies in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He accused foreign debtors of inflexibility by demanding repayment of the region's $ 420 billion foreign debt without regard to a nation's ability to pay. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> owes international banks and lenders $ 33 billion _ fourth largest in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. `` I hope this painful sacrifice by our country will serve for the leaders of the industrial powers to reflect that we are not exaggerating when we say the crisis is serious,'' the 66-year-old leader said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced Friday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would provide <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> with a $ 450 million bridge loan to help <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> meet its short-term financial needs. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> also Friday said it would loan <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> $ 50 million. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was making the loan to help ease the financial crisis facing <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>' month-old government. The loans are part of an overall package from countries including <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as well as from international lenders, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said in today's editions. Quoting government and banking officials, it said the emergency loans will total nearly $ 2 billion. The rioting and looting in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> and seven other cities was touched off by government-imposed hikes in bus fares and fuel, which appeared to release pent-up frustration over the country's austerity program. Perez on Friday confirmed at least 300 people had been killed and 2,000 injured since the unrest flared Monday. He put the number of arrests at `` barely 1,000.'' The <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> today quoted unofficial sources as saying an estimated 350 to 500 people had died in four days of rioting. The newspaper said more than 2,000 had been arrested in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>. Curfew hours were shortened Friday from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. as the rioting ended, although early today soldiers and police exchanged sporadic gunfire with snipers in some low-income <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> neighborhoods. The Federation of University Students said 31 people were missing and alleged that <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> patrols had executed people dragged out of homes. The student group accused police of conducting indiscriminant searches and arrests of student and labor leaders in areas where no riots were reported. There was no immediate government response to the charges. Speaking at his news conference Friday, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said whether <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> can continue to make principal and interest payments on its foreign debt depends on the success of his austerity program. `` The crisis Latin American nations are undergoing has a name written with capital letters _ foreign debt,'' he said. Other nations facing similar economic crises include <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, where a battle in January between rebels and the army claimed 39 lives, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. In a question-and-answer session with reporters, the president appeared to indicate that <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> had already suspended the debt payments. However, Venezuelan officials later Friday said there had been differing interpretations of his remarks and that the payments would be kept up at least until the end of the month. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> was referring to economic austerity measures required under an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> exchange </ORGANIZATION> for a $ 4.3 billion loan over the next three years. Earlier this week, the government asked the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to include provisions allowing <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> to suspend all payments on its debt until September. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> is one of the few developing nations that has been servicing foreign debt, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said, complaining that Western banks had not recognized the effort by granting new loans. Oil-producing <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> has for decades been one of the wealthiest and most politically stable nations in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But a fall in world oil prices since 1981, combined with debt payments, has depleted monetary reserves. Real wages have fallen by a third since 1981, and inflation is expected to double this year to 70 percent.

 The state disaster agency has declared a drought warning for 16 eastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> counties in the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> basin </LOCATION> and asked people to cut water consumption. Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Singel </PERSON>, who chairs the state <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday the shortfall in precipitation and seriously low reservoirs forced the action. `` It's good policy ... and prudent water management,'' <PERSON> Singel </PERSON> said. `` It will go a long way to relieving a situation that may be critical in July.'' People in eastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> are urged to cut water consumption by 10 percent by taking such steps as checking for water leaks in their homes and curbing the use of washing machines and dishwashers. <PERSON> Singel </PERSON> said problems could start as early as next month if conservation steps are not taken now. The next step would be a drought emergency with enforced water cutbacks. More than 20 million people in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> depend upon the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for their water supply, <PERSON> Singel </PERSON> said, and rainfall in the river's basin during the past six months has averaged 4 to 6 inches below normal.

<HEAD>Flurry Over Report Of Tipsy Party For Intelligence Chief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A surprise birthday party for the chief of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s intelligence agency has caused a flurry, with a reported reprimand from the prime minister and an allegation that top security service officials got drunk. Parliament member <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Menachem </PERSON> said he demanded an investigation of the party for the <ORGANIZATION> Shin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bet </ORGANIZATION> chief, whose name is kept secret. <PERSON> Ben-Menachem </PERSON> alleged the party could amount to a security breach. The legislator said Friday that <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> waiters served the guests and `` at the end of the party some of the guests got drunk, among them senior Shin Bet officials.'' <PERSON> Ben-Menachem </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he sent a telegram to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> demanding an investigation, particularly on the report that <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> waiters served the party. `` Since the identity of the <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON> head is secret, this, if proven true, could lead to a serious breach of security and to the exposure of his identity,'' <PERSON> Ben-Menachem </PERSON> of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> wrote in the telegram. <PERSON> Ben-Menachem </PERSON> said his information was based on a `` number of sources'' and that their reports were identical. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, a former agent for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> intelligence agency, reprimanded the Shin Bet chief for the party, the Hebrew daily <ORGANIZATION> Hadashot </ORGANIZATION> reported. Despite the secrecy surrounding the security chief, <PERSON> Hadashot </PERSON> wrote, many ministers, legislators and reporters were invited to the surprise party to celebrate the Shin Bet chief's 45th birthday. It was organized two weeks ago by the guest of honor's longtime companion, a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> woman. The weekly magazine <LOCATION> Yerushalaim </LOCATION> also gave a detailed description of the party. `` The <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON> head took his famous trumpet and gave them full five minutes, including the inevitable ` Summertime,''' it reported. `` The party lasted from 9.30 p.m. till 3 in the morning.'' The party was held at the <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> cafeteria. Hadashot reported that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who was an agent in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> during his 10 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION>, `` reacted with amazement and shock'' to media reports describing the party. The prime minister's office declined comment, saying in a statement that `` this is an issue between the prime minister and the Shin Bet.'' <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> said he did not feel the party was improper. `` I was invited to the party and went because he is a friend of mine,'' <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> said. `` Nobody among the guests could cause any damage. They all knew who the Shin Bet head is.'' The party could prove damaging to the prestige of <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON>, which has been trying to rehabilitate itself since a 1987 judicial commission report saying agents had routinely perjured themselves in court since 1971. The former Shin Bet chief, <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON>, resigned in 1986 over a scandal involving the fatal beating during interrogation of two Palestinian hijackers who seized an Israeli bus in April 1984. <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON> agents were shown to have made up evidence to conceal their role in the beating.

 Five nuns protesting the liberalization of their order plan to spend a sixth month barricaded in their monastery unless they are convinced of the legitimacy of a <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> directive to stop. The nuns have refused since Oct. 4 to leave the monastery's infirmary until the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> ruled in the dispute The nuns said they feared their mother superior would evict them before the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> had a chance to review their case. A spokeswoman for the nuns said Friday they did n't believe the ruling delivered to them by Roman Catholic Bishop <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodimer </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, diocese was legitimate and that they would continue their protest. `` Nothing came here with a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> seal on it,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, the spokeswoman. `` It's the bishop's final trick to get them out.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said an appeal to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s highest court, the Apostolica Signatura, could take two weeks or more to be decided. Two of the women whose temporary five-year vows expired during the protest were told they must leave the Monastery of the Most Blessed <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Paterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diocese </ORGANIZATION> announced. Two others were told they should seek residence in a different convent, and the fifth, a 71-year-old nun who suffers heart problems, was told she would be allowed to stay at the monastery, said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Rodimer </PERSON>. The five nuns were among 13 cloistered members of the Order of Discalced Carmelites at the monastery. The nuns said they wanted the monastery returned to the Carmelites' traditionally austere lifestyle. They had objected to the introduction of such modern elements as television and candy. `` Despite the difficult situation created by some of the religious, the fundamental principles of religious life were firmly retained with prudence and charity,'' read the ruling from Cardinal <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamer </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregation </ORGANIZATION> for the Religious, which oversees religious communities. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said he did not know if the five nuns would be forcibly removed if they refused to leave. The mother superior, Prioress Mother <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>, called the standoff a `` scandal'' when the nuns took over the infirmary and criticized the unruly members of her order for disrupting the cloistered lifestyle. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rodimer </PERSON> have said the controversy centered on the rebel nuns' inability to follow their mother superior's orders. Sister <PERSON> Eliane </PERSON>, a nun who has acted as a spokeswoman for those not involved in the protest, said she had no immediate comment. `` Not now, not yet,'' she said, adding that the others did not want to comment. Mrs. <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said all five women still considered themselves nuns and part of the order and that they planned to stay until they heard from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s highest court. `` We entered the monastery for a particular lifestyle, and what these other, liberal nuns, did is change these rules,'' Sister <PERSON> John </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, one of the barricaded nuns whose temporary vows expired, said in a telephone interview shortly after the nuns took over the infirmary. `` We would n't be doing this unless we were desperate.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheek </PERSON> is to meet today with student representatives to discuss their grievances in connection with the naming of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> as a trustee of the university. About 2,000 students, protesting <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s the selection, took over an auditorium stage Friday and forced officials to move a convocation including presentation of an honorary degree to comedian <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>. The convocation was moved to an art gallery where there was a brief ceremony to give Cosby an honorary degree before he left the campus. `` The students at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> have a tradition of being activists,'' university spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermesch </PERSON> said later. `` When they feel stongly about issues, they demonstrate.''

<HEAD>Prosecutors Indict Business Leaders In Japanese Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prosecutors today indicted four businessmen for bribery in a stock scandal that has toppled several high-ranking government officials and tarnished the reputation of Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. Those indicted today included <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, the 52-year-old founder and former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> conglomerate, the prosecutors' office said. <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, arrested Feb. 13, is accused of giving bribes. The company reportedly sold about 687,000 unlisted stocks of its real estate subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, at bargain prices to politicians, their aides, and other prominent figures in September 1986. Purchasers made huge profits when the stocks went public and skyrocketed in value. Also indicted were <PERSON> Ei </PERSON> <PERSON> Shikiba </PERSON>, 55, and <PERSON> Hisahiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON>, 56, two former officials of the giant private company, <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION>, prosecutors said. They are accused of receiving Recruit bribes. <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobayashi </PERSON>, the 43-year-old vice president of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>, was also indicted for offering bribes, prosecutors said. First Finance is a Recruit subsidiary that financed the stock sales. Today's indictments were the first since November, when prosecutors indicted former Recruit official <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsubara </PERSON> for allegedly trying to bribe an opposition lawmaker into soft-pedaling a parliamentary investigation into the scandal. Since the stock scandal became public last summer, more than 10 politicians and business leaders have resigned. Among them were three members of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s cabinet, including former Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> faces opposition calls in parliament to resign or account for his links to the scandal. The parties have urged <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to submit purchase contracts and other documents for Recruit shares allegedly held by his former secretary, <PERSON> Ihei </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Katsuyuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON>, a relative of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> officials were among those who received unlisted Recruit stocks. The telecommunications company reportedly extended special favors to Recruit, including resale to Recruit of two U.S.-made Cray supercomputers and the leasing of telephone lines at reduced rates. News reports today said <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> also has made special arrangements for Recruit to use an emergency fast-speed digital circuit free of charge. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the prosecutors will question <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> further about former <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON>'s role in the scandal. News reports have said Shinto met <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> twice in 1985 to discuss the resale of the Cray computers. In the stock scandal, former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> is suspected of telling <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> to buy the two supercomputers and sell them to Recruit to benefit the company. <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> on Monday denied the charge.

<HEAD>Repatriated Vietnamese Told To Behave When They Get Home</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Vietnamese refugees who returned to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> have been put in a transit camp and told to be sure and get along with fellow villagers when they are allowed to go home, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> media says. A chartered jet took the 46 men, 19 women and 10 children back Thursday in the first large repatriation from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. They were among 11,000 Vietnamese who reached the British colony last year after its decision that those who could not prove they fled persecution would be regarded as illegal immigrants. The repatriation was arranged by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> promised not to prosecute the returnees. In <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, the commander of marine police acknowledged that <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has been `` redirecting'' Vietnamese boat people away from its shores for more than a year. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Theerachai </PERSON> <PERSON> Reancharoen </PERSON> said a boatload of 32 Vietnamese was escorted south Friday. Reports from <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s two television stations on Friday showed the returnees housed at a spacious college an hour's drive from the airport Government radio said they would go home to their villages next week. <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> showed them having breakfast, and quoted one as saying the food was better than they received in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. It quoted members of a family as saying they were glad to be home and would urge friends not to leave <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Officials of the Vietnamese government and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugee agency visited the boat people Friday, the station reported. It said Vietnamese officials warned the boat people not to leave illegally again and those from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> promised to visit them in their villages. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Can </PERSON>, director of immigration at the Vietnamese <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters that the people who returned earlier had caused trouble in villages. <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the colony's other television station, reported that Vietnamese officials would give lectures to the returnees on how to get along with other villagers. A <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> report Friday quoted the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as saying the repatriation `` shows our goodwill toward the first countries of settlement which have met with difficulties caused by illegal <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> immigrants.'' Gen. <PERSON> Theerachai </PERSON> said the boat <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> sent away Friday was escorted south along the coast, a route leading to <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. The Thai practice of redirecting boats to <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> is widely known, but officials rarely admit it publicly. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Theerachai </PERSON> said the Vietnamese sail away voluntarily. `` We no longer push off boats from our shores,'' he said. `` We just redirect the passengers to other countries that can help them go to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, places where they want to go. `` We provide them protection, refuel their boats, give them food, water and medicine. That's humanitarian.''

<HEAD>Judge Rules Florida Town's Voting System Discriminates Against Blacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has sided with blacks who claimed that the town of <PERSON> Starke </PERSON>'s at-large voting policy has effectively shut them out of local government. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON>, noting that the Starke charter still contains a residential segregation clause, concluded in his 42-page order filed Monday that blacks `` have suffered from pervasive racial discrimination.'' He gave each side 30 days to propose remedies. City Attorney <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had argued during trial in June that the at-large system benefited all <PERSON> Starke </PERSON> residents and the north <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> town of 5,300 people was too small to divide into districts. But attorneys representing a group of black residents and the <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, who filed the lawsuit in 1986, said citywide voting for city commission members has shut out <PERSON> Starke </PERSON>'s black residents, who represent 32 percent of the voting population. <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON> found that although city services have not been denied to blacks, political opportunity has been in both elective and appointive positions. `` Perhaps the clearest example of city-sponsored discrimination can be found in the city charter of 1927,'' the judge wrote. The provision, still on the books but not enforced for years, requires that blacks reside in the northeast section of the town, known locally as <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>. `` The lingering effects of this historical racial discrimination are evident by the fact that blacks today continue to be segregated by custom in the northeastern quadrant of the city,'' the judge's order said If <PERSON> Starke </PERSON>'s at-large voting system is allowed to remain, it `` will continue to deny blacks equal access to the city's political process,'' he wrote. <PERSON> Starke </PERSON> has held at-large elections for its five city commissioners, one of whom serves as mayor, and for the city clerk and police chief. `` We're hoping we can settle as far as drawing the lines up without any further battle,'' said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Spooner </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Bradford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. `` I would hope that both sides can sit down and work out an agreement that is acceptable to both and get down to running city government,'' said City Commissioner <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>. The next local elections are scheduled for fall.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' pledge to help passengers find other flights was little consolation early today to thousands left on the ground when a strike forced the airline to cut 75 percent of its scheduled flights. When <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shafer </PERSON>'s flight was canceled, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> agreed to put him and the other members of his church group up at a hotel. `` They -LRB- Eastern -RRB- had a block of 30 rooms at the Holiday Inn, but they just kept sending people out there,'' the 41-year-old <PERSON> DuBois </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, man said. `` By the time we got out there there were none left, people were arguing and carrying on.'' The 8,500-member Machinist union, joined by pilots and flight attendants, went on strike at midnight Friday in a 17-month-old wage dispute. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, executive vice president and chief operating officer, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> was suspending service to nearly 60 cities today and Sunday, but added that the company has drafted an extensive plan to keep its planes in the air throughout the strike. Service was to be maintained to nearly 50 cities, including <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s major flights out of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and on its Northeast Shuttle and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> routes, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. At <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, a businessman from <LOCATION> Woodmere </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, arrived on an Eastern flight just before the strike was announced and said he believed the walkout means the end of the airline. `` I really think so and it's too bad,'' <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said after he got off Flight 194 from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, which landed at 11:50 p.m., 1 -LCB- hours late. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said most flights will be suspended at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> hub. Eastern ticket offices were extending their hours to help rebook passengers on canceled flights `` to the extent that is humanly possible,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. Eastern's strike plans also included hiring 1,100 experienced non-union mechanics and technicians to augment management maintenance workers, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. The 3,500-member pilots union has voted to honor Machinists union picket lines, but <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> predicted some union pilots would cross the picket lines. Only Eastern pilots would be used to fly to the planes, he said, adding that about 200 management pilots were on call. The company also has nonunion employees and supervisors to fill in for flight attendants, whose 5,900-member union said it also would support the strike.

 A bid to take the nation's largest and best-known legal brothel public through a $ 23.3 million stock offering has become an international affair, says the head of the company handling the sale. `` When you've got the most unusual offering in the history of Wall Street, you get calls from all over the world,'' <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Walloga </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, Fla.-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wallstreet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. `` Ever since we announced, we have just been swamped with calls from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I had one broker in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> who's called in for a very, very large order.'' <PERSON> Walloga </PERSON> represents <ORGANIZATION> Mustang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an investors' group made up primarily of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> businessmen and attorneys who want to raise the money to buy the brothel 10 miles east of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> from owners <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Conforte </PERSON>. The Confortes would receive $ 13 million for the brothel and $ 5 million for promising not to set up a competing bordello, <PERSON> Walloga </PERSON> said. The remaining $ 5.3 million would be used for expansion and working capital. Prostitution is legal in most of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s rural counties. <ORGANIZATION> Under </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> rules, none of the principals in the transaction could discuss it, but <PERSON> Conforte </PERSON> has said earlier he expected to pocket little profit because most of the money would go directly to the government for back taxes and interest he owes. `` I owe $ 12 million to $ 13 million in taxes and the capital gains are going to be $ 4 million to $ 5 million. I'm going to do my bit to reduce the deficit,'' said <PERSON> Conforte </PERSON>, who spent 18 months in prison in 1984 and 1985 for failing to pay his taxes. <PERSON> Walloga </PERSON> said six states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> had approved sales of the stock after it was accepted by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. States where the shares are being sold are <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. It has not been approved for sale in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. The sale, at $ 20 a share, began two weeks ago. `` There's a lot of novelty interest in the stock. We do n't know how serious people are,'' <PERSON> Walloga </PERSON> said. `` Of the people who call to ask about it, about half call back `` Some people think it's a speculative investment and they're right The people who should be buying it are the speculators.''

<TEXT>
 Cat <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> once sang about peace, but disc jockeys nationwide are having a less than peaceful reaction to his support of the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death threat against `` Satanic Verses'' author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was a leading pop balladeer of the 1970s, putting out such hits as `` Moon Shadow,'' `` Peace Train,'' `` Wild World'' and `` Morning Has Broken.'' But it's been years since his last hit, and the singer-songwriter whose gentle style fit in so well during the last years of the hippie generation has long since abandoned his music career to follow the Moslem faith. The British-born <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who now goes by the <ORGANIZATION> Moslim </ORGANIZATION> name <PERSON> Yusuf </PERSON> <PERSON> Islam </PERSON>, leaped back into the spotlight last week when he created an international controversy by telling Moslem students in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s call to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> was supported by the teachings of Islam's holy book, the Koran. Radio stations around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> responded almost immediately by banning <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' records from their airwaves. `` The Koran makes it clear: If someone defames the prophet, then he must die,'' the singer-turned-teacher said. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, in a statement released Friday, denied he wants to see the author killed, however, adding that he `` simply stated the Islamic ruling on the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair.'' `` My only crime was, I suppose, in being honest,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said in the statement released in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` I stood up and expressed my belief and I am in no way apologizing for it.'' He also said the novel `` insults God and his prophets, including those prophets honored by Christians and Jews as well as Moslems.'' Meanwhile, officials at radio stations across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said Friday they have pulled the singer's records from their play lists. Stations such as WBZY-AM in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, KZPS-FM in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, WCXR-FM in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, WEBE-FM in <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> KLSX-FM </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> have dropped his records from their programming. In <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, album-rock purveyor WRIF-FM promoted a `` No Cat Stevens Weekend'' by cutting into his songs with explosions or the sound of a punch in the mouth `` right after a very optimistic and non-violent line of dialogue,'' program director <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> said. `` We're doing the ` No Cat Stevens Weekend' to make a point about one human being advocating the death of another ... This guy carries a lot of weight, a lot of people grew up listening to his stuff,'' <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> said. A spokesman for WCXR in the nation's capital said that station pulled the records off the air Feb. 28 after serious discussion of listeners' complaints that they felt uncomfortable hearing <PERSON> Cat </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. `` We did n't do this to generate publicity or to scream our call letters out,'' said promotion director <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapidus </PERSON>. `` We're trying not to support an entertainer that's come out in favor of assassination.''

 Midnight struck and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> McGarry </PERSON> took a swig of beer, thrust up a sign promising punishment for scab workers, and walked across the street separating union headquarters from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> property. The third strike against the airline in 31 years had begun. `` They wanted it and now they have it,'' said <PERSON> McGarry </PERSON>, 22, an aircraft mechanic whose father, <PERSON> Russ </PERSON>, is coordinating national strike activities for the 8,500-member Machinists union. The union went on strike at midnight Friday when talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> collapsed. <PERSON> McGarry </PERSON> was one of the first to reach the gates, locked and topped with barbed wire. Before him stood police in riot gear. Behind him, more than 2,500 red-shirted Machinists and supporters quickly filled the narrow entrance way in front of Eastern hangars. For nearly 15 minutes, the chain-link fence took the brunt of the frustration and anger union members say has been building since <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> acquired the airline three years ago. The fence bent under the push but did not give. The padlocked gates rattled and police raised tear gas guns. `` We're just letting off steam,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, 41, an Eastern baggage handler of 21 years. `` Hey, we just want to let them know we're here.'' A few paper cups were lobbed over the fence. Soon, they were replaced by rocks and bottles. The crash of a cinder block startled some officers. The chips were quickly gathered up and hurled toward several <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management workers, who retreated inside. `` Get back. Get back across the street,'' cried a union official. `` We want to keep this legal. We're going to set up pickets, but we're not going to break any laws.'' A few union members lurched for the fence, but were pulled back by union leaders. Then car horns blared. Workers heading back to union headquarters blocked traffic for nearly 10 minutes as an effigy of a `` scab worker'' was torn apart. The legs of the dummy were tossed above the crowd. The head rested on the hood of a pickup truck. `` I hope <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is watching,'' said <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>. `` The message is pretty obvious.'' After the display, police moved in and herded workers back onto union property. Twenty-five minutes after midnight, the first of the workers began to leave. `` I think we made our point,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, a 21-year mechanic suspended without pay for a month following wildcat walkouts in February. `` It was really just for show.'' `` It was loud, but pretty peaceful,'' said <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police spokeswoman <PERSON> Myriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Royale </PERSON>. No arrests were made, no injuries were reported and no damage was found, she said. Two hours into the strike, most of the workers had left the union headquarters and pickets were under way at Eastern headquarters, terminals and cargo facilities. `` We're going to keep this peaceful,'' said <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Haber </PERSON>, senior general chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> local. `` We just needed to let off some steam.''

 A businessman linked to the governing Socialists has been charged with insider trading, making him the sixth person accused in a scandal that has embarrassed the government, a news report said. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Theret </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> investor who has backed <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidates, was charged Friday by Investigating Magistrate <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Boizette </PERSON> with insider trading, the news agency <ORGANIZATION> Agence-France </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said. Quoting unidentified legal sources, the agency said <PERSON> Theret </PERSON> is accused of illegally buying shares of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company, <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, before the French state-owned aluminum manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Pichiney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> offered a higher price in a successful takeover. The Pichiney offer sent the stock's price soaring. On Feb. 16, three men also were charged with insider trading: <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> stockbrokers <PERSON> Pierre-Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiplinger </PERSON>, Theret's partner in a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> investment firm. Also charged in the scandal that day was <PERSON> Roger-Patrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON>, a retired businessman and longtime friend of President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. Theret was not charged with the others because he had been hospitalized with a heart ailment. French law requires that an investigating magistrate notify a suspect face-to-face of criminal charges. <PERSON> Pelat </PERSON> and a friend, <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierco </PERSON>, have been charged with receiving insider information and profiting from it. The charge carries the same maximum penalty as actual insider trading: two years in prison and a fine of up to four times the amount of illegal profits.

The rebels have been fighting the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> government for 20 years. <PERSON> Sison </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has a different relationship with the country's 160,000-member armed forces than did former President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who she ousted in a civilian-backed military rebellion in February 1986. `` <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> controlled and manipulated the military as an instrument,'' <PERSON> Sison </PERSON> said. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, on the other hand, is being controlled and manipulated by the military. ... Aquino is a figurehead president.'' <PERSON> Sison </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>, a retired armed forces chief of staff, holds sway in the military while Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s brother, Rep. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cojuangco </PERSON>, controls `` money matters. He did not elaborate. Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON>, the armed forces spokesman who was interviewed on the same radio program, said <PERSON> Sison </PERSON> is wrong. `` I think -LRB- <PERSON> Sison </PERSON> -RRB- is losing his mind,'' <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said. `` He has a very rich imagination. Maybe that is the effect of the good life in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> because he is not thinking of problems there.'' <PERSON> Sison </PERSON> was on a speaking tour in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> when his passport was revoked in September by the government. Military officials accused <PERSON> Sison </PERSON> of engaging in subversive activities against the government in his travels abroad. The military has also charged that <PERSON> Sison </PERSON> had resumed his post as leader of the clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sison </PERSON> said nothing of his relationship to the rebel group during his radio program. He also did not say whether <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> authorities have granted his application for asylum. <PERSON> Sison </PERSON>, who led a handful of university intellectuals in founding the banned party in December 1968, was jailed for nearly 10 years until Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> set him free.

 The state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> says <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> must serve the full one-year prison sentence he got for illegally carrying the gun he used to shoot four teen-agers on a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> subway in 1984. Releasing <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> after just two months in jail `` would deprecate the seriousness of the crime and undermine respect for the law,'' the board said Friday. Monday was the earliest <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> could have been released. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Elwin </PERSON>, executive director of the parole board, said the decision meant <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> would have to serve his full one-year sentence, minus any time off for good behavior, unless he can persuade a court to overturn the board's ruling. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, 41, was convicted on the gun charge, but acquitted of attempted murder, assault and reckless endangerment charges. The case drew international attention. Some people called the white radio technician a racist vigilante for shooting four black young men who were panhandling. Others hailed <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> as a hero who resisted a robbery. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> maintained the men were about to rob him and that he was acting in self defense. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, said he might try to have the decision overturned and called the board's decision outrageous. `` Anybody in power is afraid to do something that favors <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> for fear of being labeled a racist by the fringe elements,'' he said. `` So he sits and rots. `` He's angry. He's frustrated,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>. `` He does n't belong there.'' <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> began serving his sentence Jan. 13 after appeals in the state courts failed. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to reverse the conviction.

<HEAD>Feds Order Airlines To Check Boeing 747 Cargo Doors Within 30 Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has issued an emergency order requiring all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to reinforce latch mechanisms on <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 cargo doors within 30 days. Friday's emergency airworthiness directive, which speeds up the timetable of an earlier directive, also specifies inspections and tests of the doors that must be done until modifications are completed. The action Friday follows the Feb. 24 accident involving a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet that had taken off from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> in which a 10-by 20-foot hole ripped in the fuselage and nine people were sucked from the craft. They are presumed dead. Though the cause of the accident has yet to be determined, the possible failure of the forward cargo door latch is under investigation. The door was separated from the aircraft with parts of the fuselage that surrounded it. The order affects about 150 airplanes. However, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Neale </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said some airlines have already made the required modifications, which include steel reinforcements to cargo door latches. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> had issued a directive last July 1 ordering the doors inspected and modified by the end of 1989 or July 1, 1990, depending on the type of locking mechanism installed. That order was issued after a cargo door on a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> 747 opened 1 -LCB- inches at the start of a flight from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said they did n't believe at the time the situation warranted an emergency directive. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> also said it planned to issue another airworthiness directive in the near future requiring improvements in the warning system that alerts flight crews when any cargo door is not properly closed and locked. That order was expected as soon as the design improvements can be delivered and tested.

<HEAD>Airports and Railroads Brace for Eastern Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILL LESTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> passengers today contended with canceled weekend flights, bus companies geared up for extra business and commuter railroads readied to become the next target of the striking machinists' union. Eastern machinists, hoping to bolster their bargaining position, said they would set up picket lines at commuter railroads in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area that serve 320,000 people daily. `` This thing will really take off on Monday, when we take out the railroads. And we're prepared to do that,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, president of Local 1894 at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after the machinists' strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> began early today. Eastern responded by cutting up to three-quarters of its weekend flights, including most flights out of its <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> hub and nearly 60 other cities. The carrier's pilots and flight attendants said they would honor the picket lines. The Miami-based airline, however, planned to maintain service to nearly 50 cities, including most flights out of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle and Latin American routes. Eastern also said other airlines were honoring its tickets. But the strike probably ruined a trip to <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> for <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zisser </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oceanside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and their 3-year-old son. They arrived at Kennedy airport as the strike began, and their Eastern tickets to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, were n't much good at the moment. `` Even 48 hours ago they told me do n't worry, we're not going on strike,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Zisser </PERSON>. `` Now I ca n't get on half the flights because they're all booked and do n't have enough money to pay the difference some other airlines want.'' The machinists' union has contended that its union can picket any transportation company covered by the Railway Labor Act, which includes airlines, railroads and some shipping concerns. But other airlines insisted their machinists and other airline workers would be violating no-strike clauses in their contracts if they honored picket lines set up by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> strikers. On Friday, a federal judge in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> agreed with the airlines, and prohibited machinists' union members at other airlines from joining the strike. But in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, general chairman of District 100 of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, said union members at other airlines were expected to walk out. `` There's a good possibility some of the other airlines will go on sympathy -LRB- strike -RRB- with us, such as <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. In the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area, union leaders at the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commuter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> say they will honor Eastern picket lines on Monday. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION>, predicted `` absolute chaos next week. And the fact is, there's not a lot we can do.'' <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, a striking <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> machinist, said he understood that commuters would be upset if the strike expanded to railroads. `` But we're fighting for all working people,'' he said. `` We already have agreed to lower our salaries but that's not enough. People just do n't understand that this strike is not just for us. If Eastern does this to us other companies will try to do it to them.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> said the national passenger railroad could continue limited operations for only a few days if picketed by workers supporting a strike against Eastern. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Greyhound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said they would be using 200 additional buses to run extra non-stop service between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, beginning Monday. Travel agents said many Eastern passengers may be stranded because a lot of other airlines and railroads were fully booked. <PERSON> Ida </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartazo </PERSON>, co-owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Mediterranean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lodi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said she had a group of 18 college students scheduled to fly to Fort Myers Sunday for spring break. The students made their reservations, including hotel, four months ago. `` The only thing I could do is tell them to drive down,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 Bodies are lying in morgues, sometimes for years, while their survivors negotiate for money and jobs as compensation from the dead relative's workplace, an official daily said today. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said survivors of a worker at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Theater Troupe have refused to let the body be cremated until the troupe agrees to provide two apartments and a job for one of the children. A second case was cited in the report of the body of a woman that has been kept at one hospital for more than five years because the family and her work unit ca n't agree on compensation. It also said in another hospital run by the military that 100 of the 500 bodies in the morgue had been there more than two months. The daily quoted a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official as saying state-run work units must pay pensions to children too young to support themselves if their parents die or are seriously injured on the job. However, there are no regulations saying children can take their parent's job, the report said. The official was quoted as saying, `` Chinese people are too dependent on the government and their work units.'' He said the Chinese `` should develop their abilities to support themselves in society.''

 An oil tanker that ran aground floated free when salvage workers lightened the ship's load to prevent more crude oil or fuel from spilling into the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and washing up on <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s beaches. The 800-foot <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> `` suddenly just started floating,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Goff </PERSON> said Friday night. Officials had planned to wait until high tide early today but workers who pumped off more than 9,400 tons of ballast water and some of the remaining 3.8 million gallons of crude oil lightened the ship enough so that it floated free on its own, said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartvigsen </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. He said the ship was being towed to deeper water and two ships would stay with it overnight `` but everything's going great so far.'' Officials today were to assess the damage to the ship, as well as the extent of the oil spill, already in the thousands of gallons, he said. Meanwhile, state and federal agencies launched a cleanup of the thick, smelly oil washing in along a 2-mile stretch of little-used shoreline 15 miles west of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> and famed <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. High winds and rough seas tore the vessel from its offshore mooring Thursday night. It ran aground on a coral reef and ruptured a fuel tank. A local oil spill cleanup cooperative, called the <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, was on the scene, said <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, the Houston-based domestic oil and gas division of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s Pacific Area Strike Team was en route to help in the cleanup. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, will pay for the costs of the cleanup, according to <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Alcantara </PERSON> The <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> had unloaded 400,000 barrels of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> crude oil at an offshore mooring a mile off the <ORGANIZATION> Hawaiian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refinery </ORGANIZATION> when it tore free, said Capt. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Piche </PERSON>, commanding officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. The skipper, Captain <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>, notified the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> there was no need for assistance, but 2 -LCB- hours later, the ship radioed it had run aground in 27 feet of water about one-third mile offshore of Barbers Point, located on the southwest corner of <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s main island, <PERSON> Piche </PERSON> said When the ship tore away from its mooring, floating hoses unloading the oil pulled free, spilling about 25,000 gallons of crude oil into the sea. Although valves automatically closed, the oil spilling from the hoses created a three-mile-long oil slick spreading parallel to the shore to the east toward <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. By Friday night, it was dissipating and posed no immediate threat to the shoreline, officials said. When the ship ran aground, one of the vessel's fuel tanks ruptured, spilling about 92,000 gallons of the thick black oil, much of it washing ashore, fouling the sand and coral rocks. <PERSON> Libert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Landgraf </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> and Natural Resources, said there was no immediate evidence of injury or death to marine life or birds. Oil washed up on a beach where a popular tourist luau is held, prompting the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> to post `` Polluted Waters'' signs, and at other areas as far as two miles to the north, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>. Meanwhile in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>, an oil slick about 2 miles long and a quarter-mile wide was reported Friday about 10 to 12 miles off the north <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Largo </LOCATION> coast, said to <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dye </PERSON>. The origin of the oil had not been determined, but <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> marine safety office spokeswoman <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mountcastle </PERSON> said it could have been bunker oil released by a ship.

<HEAD>Convalescing President Vows To Complete Term Of Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> says he is determined to serve out the rest of his current term despite `` derision and attacks'' following his stroke. The 73-year-old <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, in an interview published today by major Afrikaans-language newspapers, said it was too early to speculate whether he would seek another term after his five-year term expires in September. He plans to return to work in April. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> suffered a stroke on Jan. 18 and has spent most of the time since then recuperating at his coastal vacation home while his duties are carried out by an acting president, Constitutional Development Minister <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said in the interview he would complete the term despite calls for him to step aside. `` The fact that I am still subject to derision and attacks shows that I am in the way of some people,'' he was quoted as saying. `` I have a task to perform and as my strength increases I will proceed with that task.'' Calls from his resignation have come from liberal and far-right opposition parties, as well as from some members of his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. A former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister, <PERSON> Hendrik </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoeman </PERSON>, said at a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rally Wednesday that <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> should make way for F.W. <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who took over as party leader a month ago and is heir apparent for the presidency. <PERSON> Schoeman </PERSON> `` has said out loud what all other Nationalists are thinking: President <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> must go _ now,'' Business Day, a leading financial newspaper, said Friday in an editorial. Although <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klerk </ORGANIZATION> shares <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s views on most major policy issues, he has been depicted as more flexible. During <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s convalescence, both de Klerk and <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> have suggested in speeches that the government is willing to lessen its reliance on racial classification as the foundation for political and social structures However, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has told white voters he will not betray them and has affirmed his commitment to segregated residential areas for whites who want them. Like <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has given no indication he is willing to consider full voting rights for the country's black majority.

 An Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> official described as irresponsible an audit that claimed thousands of citizenship certificates _ worth as much as $ 155 million on the black market _ were lost from the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> office. `` These are dangerous allegations that now show those who investigate need investigation,'' said <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> district director in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said the government's audit was conducted at the request of Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> would not comment on specific findings of the report, adding that it wo n't be made public until <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has had an opportunity to review and comment on it. The audit claimed 23,000 citizenship certificates, which are as good as a passport, had been misplaced. About 14,000 of the supposedly missing documents belonged to new citizens sworn in by then-Chief Justice <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> in a widely publicized July 1986 ceremony at the Orange Bowl, said <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>. `` This is the most irresponsible statement I have ever heard in all my years of service,'' <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said Friday. `` The fact is, they never were missing _ all they had to do was to look into the computer.'' All but 1,200 of the certificates were discovered in one computer bank, and the rest were expected to be located after a check of a second, <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said he wrote <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> two weeks ago about problems in the report and asked that the auditors be investigated. `` There were false statements made,'' he said. `` When I first saw that document, it took 60 seconds to ascertain through computer records that those -LRB- certificates -RRB- were not missing.'' Earlier Friday, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> was asked about the certificates at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary immigration subcommitte hearing in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> told the panel's chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., he first learned of the supposedly missing certificates from the Justice audit The commissioner said he did n't know about the finding until he read the audit. In Friday editions, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported that <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> auditors found serious instances of mismanagement, including the episode involving the missing certificates. The audit said <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> could n't account for them more than a year after investigators discovered them missing, and the agency took no steps to prevent further losses. The report also said that two years after investigators found at least 61,500 naturalized citizens had n't turned in their permanent resident alien cards, the agency had not tried to recover them.

<TEXT>
 Physicians treating a snake-venom researcher, whose need for rare medicine prompted <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> intervention, were awaiting a shipment of serum from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> today to counteract a deadly viper bite. In an unusual effort initiated by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON>, special assistant to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, antivenins effective against the bite of a Pakistani pit viper were located in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs rules were waived to place the shipments quickly on flights to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The antivenins were sought for <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>, 78, who was in serious but stable condition at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> today after being bitten in the left hand by the viper earlier in the week. The British shipment from the <ORGANIZATION> English </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> arrived Friday night. But doctors did not administer it to <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>, deciding instead to wait for the more effective Iranian serum, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. `` The one from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> is the best one, I understand, because of its properties,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` We will not give the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> one unless Mr. <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>'s condition deteriorates.'' <PERSON> Haast </PERSON> was being given plasma intermittently to replace coagulating elements of his blood. The snake's venom prohibits blood from coagulating and victims often bleed to death. <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Serpentarium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> at the university's Research Park, has been bitten 148 times by snakes and is immune to the venom of dozens of reptiles. But he had no immunity to withstand the viper's bite and checked himself into the hospital Wednesday. The Pakistani pit viper, or saw-scaled viper, is one of 1,000 exotic, poisonous snakes <PERSON> Haast </PERSON> keeps at the lab, where their venom is extracted for sale to universities and health organizations for use in research and the manufacture of antivenins. <PERSON> Haast </PERSON> had been treated earlier with antivenins from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>, including one shipment obtained through an unusual airport relay involving zoo personnel, a helicopter and a departing jetliner <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said he became involved Thursday night when he received a call from an associate of <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>'s. The associate, who had read accounts of a speech <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON> gave in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> describing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` kinder, gentler'' approach to human problems, said the serum could only be located in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and asked for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's help. <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON> said he immediately set up conference calls with people around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in other countries after doctors and specialists advised the White House that the serums <PERSON> Haast </PERSON> needed were unavailable in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Using an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interpreter who speaks <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON> put <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>'s representatives in telephone contact with serum specialists in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Two different serums were needed, he said, one for young pit vipers and another for older snakes of the same breed. Vials of the Iranian serum were due to arrive in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> this afternoon. The serum found at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> institute was the antivenin used for younger vipers. Another supply of the serum was obtained through the <ORGANIZATION> Tashkent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vaccines </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. That serum was being flown to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> for eventual shipment to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` When I decided I should get involved, I clearly did not want to disturb the president,'' <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON> said. `` But I decided, this is what the president would have wanted us to do.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> MCKEESPORT </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> _ Twenty-one officers laid off from this <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> suburb's 50-member police force will resume work Sunday thanks to a successful fund-raising campaign to pay their salaries. `` The response has been overwhelming,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Washowich </PERSON>, who announced the recall. `` McKeesport residents and people outside the city have continued to support the police. ... When asked, they've always responded.'' Donations reached $ 106,000 on Friday, including a bank's pledge to match donations dollar for dollar, <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, chief of the emergency medical services. Shoppers were still dropping coins and bills into cans at local businesses, and a number of fund-raising events were scheduled for this weekend, including dances, a basketball game and a health fair. `` We've received checks from all over the country, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, virtually everywhere,'' <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said. `` These are people who lived here 30, 40 years ago and people who never knew how to spell McKeesport.'' Police Chief <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brletic </PERSON> expressed relief as he drafted work schedules. He had to make do without the officers since they were let go last Sunday. `` This past week, while it's been very busy, the good Lord must have been watching us because we did n't have anything terrible happen,'' he said. The mayor had asked all employees to accept a wage freeze after the city discovered a $ 1.3 million deficit late last year. He had said layoffs would result if the request were refused. <PERSON> Washowich </PERSON> announced the layoffs Feb. 1, saying they were necessary because state arbitrators awarded the police pay raises of 4 percent to 4.5 percent. He said the city would save $ 90,000 by laying off 21 officers for three months. The city's volunteer ambulance company, <ORGANIZATION> McKeesport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, launched the fund-raising drive with a $ 15,000 donation Feb. 24. <PERSON> Washowich </PERSON> said the success of the fund-raiser wo n't solve the city's long-term money woes, however. `` I'm sorry to say the reality will set in,'' he said. `` Next year we have to find $ 200,000 to $ 220,000.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will cut oil exports by about 5 percent in the first half of this year, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The move is part of an effort by non-OPEC producers to shore up world oil prices by cutting or freezing exports. The action was announced Friday by <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Arutyunyan </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Soyuzneftexport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> All-Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which markets Soviet petroleum products abroad, the official Soviet news agency said. The announcement indicated a change in Soviet thinking about oil exports. In November, the deputy oil minister, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Filanovsky </PERSON>, said the country planned to continue increasing exports in the face of falling world prices because it needed the foreign currency. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Arutyunyan </PERSON> as saying the oil exports will be reduced by about 5 percent in the first six months of 1989 compared with the same period last year. The Soviets export an estimated 1.8 million barrels of oil a day. A 5 percent reduction would mean a cut of 90,000 barrels daily in export sales. In trading Friday, energy futures prices declined in volatile trading, with crude oil soaring toward the $ 19-a-barrel level before technical selling set in. Analysts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the brief rise came after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> _ producers outside the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> _ all announced the 5 percent reduction in exports. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the April contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, settled 16 cents lower at $ 18.56 a barrel, after rising as high as $ 18.88 at one point during Friday's session. Earlier this week, oil producers outside <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> met in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to coordinate output with the 13-member oil cartel. At the end of the meeting, a majority of the countries pledged to freeze or reduce their exports during the second quarter of 1989 in an attempt to shore up world oil prices. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reportedly told the other countries it was unsure whether it would reduce exports, but that if it did, it would notify them Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> dispatch quoting <PERSON> Arutyunyan </PERSON> was distributed late Friday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 `` <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>,'' of the amount of oil the Soviets exported daily in 1987, 7,000 barrels went to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 243,000 to <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, 209,000 to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, 302,000 to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, 142,000 to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, 199,000 to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, 130,000 to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and 20,000 to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A senior <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> official has accused Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> of being reckless by skiing off marked trails where a year ago an avalanche killed a close friend of the heir to the British throne. The official made the accusation after a newspaper printed a photograph purportedly showing <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> skiing in a restricted area on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gotschna </LOCATION> near warning signs printed in four languages, including English. `` There are those who learn from a mistake and there are others who do n't. Wednesday's front-page picture shows clearly that neither the prince nor his entourage heed the warnings of the responsible local officials,'' <PERSON> Sepp </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheibert </PERSON> said in a letter published today in the newspaper <PERSON> Blick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scheibert </PERSON>, chief of the federation's mass sports section, stressed in his letter to the mass circulation paper that the prince's group also was off trails when an avalanche killed a former queen's aide, Maj. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, 34, and broke both legs of another member of the party, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer-Tomkinson </PERSON>. In addition, <PERSON> Scheibert </PERSON> wrote, the <ORGANIZATION> Davos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avalanche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> said snow conditions on the day the photograph was taken were `` identical with those prevailing a year ago when the killer avalanche struck.'' `` What can the local officials do when such an ` illustrious' party ignores all rules and recommendations? he asked. Such conduct `` turns to ridicule all advisory bodies,'' he said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, 40, arrived at <LOCATION> Klosters </LOCATION> on Monday for a skiing vacation at the resort where the tragedy occurred March 10, 1988. He narrowly escaped injury on that day when the avalanche roared down on a group of skiers he was leading on a steep run off marked trails. Swiss authorities ruled the six-member group caused the avalanche but that nobody could be held personally responsible. Mrs. <PERSON> Palmer-Tomkinson </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, who was with the skiing party in 1988, also accompanied the prince this year. The group has been reported skiing mostly on a face of the 8,000-foot <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gotschna </LOCATION>, several miles south of the site of the earlier avalanche.

<TEXT>
 The British government today reaffirmed its support for author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and warned that continued agitation over his novel `` The Satanic Verses'' could do serious harm. Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said he understood `` the hurt and insult being felt'' by Moslems over the book but said most Britons accept `` that in a free country people have the right of freedom of expression.'' <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, 41, who was born a Moslem in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, has been in hiding since <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> ordered his death on Feb. 14 and Iranian clergy offered a bounty of up to $ 5.2 million for the killing. <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> spoke to reporters at a local government conference of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. It came one day after Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said she believes the novel has deeply offended Islam. Earlier today, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s comment was `` the first expression of sympathy with Moslems over the book.'' Later today, <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> released a lengthy commentary saying Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s acknowledgement must be followed up `` with concrete actions.'' If <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> accepts that the book is insulting, the state-run radio said, it `` can not object to the death sentence on the writer, which has been issued in line with <LOCATION> Sharia </LOCATION> -LRB- Islamic law -RRB-.'' The radio called on Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government to clarify `` whether or not freedom of expression and writing can be a license for defamation and insult.'' `` If the British government does not see the freedom of expression as a license for defamation, then legal prosecution of the author, prevention of further publication of the book, and removing already published copies are reasonable requests which can remove much of the friction -LRB- in the present situation -RRB-,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said in a report monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> said on Tuesday it would cut diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in a week unless it disavows the contents of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel, which has been held as blasphemous by Moslem protesters around the world <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> insists <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> withdraw the death sentence on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, who is now a naturalized Briton. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> telephoned a parliamentary aide on Friday to express concern that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was backing down in its support for him. Asked whether the government was changing its attitude to <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said: `` There's no vacillation. Let's for heaven sake let the thing settle. Let's not keep the agitation going. It could do serious harm.'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> also said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s statement was `` a clear attempt to defuse the row between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> before next Tuesday's deadline that the Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> gave to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to alter its attitude or face the consequences of a complete cut in diplomatic ties. The dispute has led the 12-member <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and several other countries to withdraw their ambassadors from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, about 80 teen-agers broke away Friday from an anti-Rushdie demonstration by 1,600 people and damaged several cars, police said. A policeman fell and bruised his leg, they said. Moslems who organized the protest immediately apologized and offered to pay for any damage, police said. One death was reported Friday in clashes between police and anti-Rushdie protests in the northern Indian city of <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>. Police reportedly fired on Moslem demonstrators, killing at least one person and injuring more than 100. Eighteen other people have been killed in protests over the book in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Demonstrations by Moslems occurred today in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> where about 400 people marched through <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> shouting `` Death To <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>!'' and in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, where about 700 protesters in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> burned an effigy of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>.

 Israeli troops blocked <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> roads today and turned back hundreds of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace activists seeking to meet Palestinians in the Arab city of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. Activists of the mainstream Peace Now movement were outraged and said Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> is `` surrendering'' to demands of Jewish settlers. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said the army was concerned clashes would break out between Jewish settlers and Jewish peace activists. Legislator <PERSON> Dedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> of the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said the blockades reflect a government policy not conducive to making peace, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. A convoy of dozens of cars and a bus, bearing poster-size signs saying `` Peace Now,'' was one of five groups that left four <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> cities to meet <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> residents in different locations to talk peace today. The army blocked them all, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. As the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> convoy made its way north from the city, military jeeps drove into the middle of the road. `` I'm sorry, but I must inform you this is a closed military area,'' a soldier identified as Col. <PERSON> Chai </PERSON> said. `` You can not proceed.'' `` We were n't planning any assemblies or marches or demonstrations _ just meetings,'' said Peace Now spokesman <PERSON> Tsali </PERSON> <PERSON> Reshef </PERSON>. `` We would like to prove to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and to the rest of the world that with the right approach and with mutual respect, peaceful relations can be had ... and we will not give up,'' he said. <PERSON> Uri </PERSON> <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Settlers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, was one of several settlement leaders who on Friday called on the army to block the meetings, charging they would `` legitimize terror'' by encouraging the Palestinian anti-Israeli revolt. At least 388 Palestinians and 17 Israelis have died in the uprising in the occupied lands, now in its 15th month. The proposed talks had been coordinated with underground leaders of the Palestinian revolt, and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> had agreed to stop violence and protests in meeting areas, Peace Now activists said. The Unified National Leadership of the Uprising distributed a leaflet in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, saying: `` We call on the masses of Palestinians ... not to attack cars with Peace Now signs.'' Peace Now has called on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which the government refuses to do because it regards the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a terrorist movement. As troops watched the Israeli vehicles make U-turns on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, about 10 Palestinians cheered from the roadside, clapping and shouting, `` Peace, peace.'' The activists returned to a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> parking lot where they unfurled banners demanding, `` Stop Shooting! Speak Peace Now!'' Legislator Ran <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> addressed the crowd briefly. `` Defense Minister <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> is ready to let 365 days go by in which there are dead and wounded on both sides, but he wo n't let even one day go by in which the two sides talk to each other,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` If anyone is killed or wounded today, it is his fault.''

 <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> put on hold today a scheduled joint excavation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to search for remains of missing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said. Fourteen <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts were to fly to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> aboard two C-130 transport planes this morning, but <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> did not give the planes clearance to enter Laotian airspace, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON>. He refused to speculate on the Laotians' possible reasons. <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> officials may have been angered when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday recommended to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the country and its neighbor, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, be declared ineligible for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid because of alleged support for drug trafficking. The recommendations came in an annual report Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. It said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe opium production is expanding in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and could be approaching 300 tons a year, and that heroin is being refined there for export through <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say there is evidence that Laotian officials are involved in processing and smuggling drugs. When that charge surfaced in last year's narcotics report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> government issued a stern denial. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to account for 547 Americans listed as missing in action in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> during the U.S.-Vietnam war. Most were airmen who flew reconnaissance and bombing missions. <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> had conducted four joint excavations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The first one was in February 1985. The Pentagon said the latest excavation was to be in southern <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION> province, where a U.S.-Laotian team surveyed in December. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no record of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plane crashing in the area. <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team had planned to work in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> for eight to 10 days.

 A limping man used his cane to beat a convenience store clerk and stole cash from the register after he was told the liquor he wanted was available only in pints, police said. The man limped off with $ 70 to $ 80, said police spokesman <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>. The man, described as in his 30s, asked to buy a fifth of liquor Friday and `` got agitated'' when told the store stocked what he wanted only in the smaller size, <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> said. The man beat the clerk on the head with his cane, then hit her with a beer bottle, <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> said. The clerk, who had been alone in the store, ran into the bathroom screaming for help, he said. The man then rifled the cash register. A customer who entered the store when the thief walked out found the clerk and called police.

<HEAD>Turkish Husband of Greek Cypriot to be Deported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A young Turkish settler who crossed illegally into southern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to find his Greek Cypriot wife will be deported, police said Saturday. The 17-year-old husband, <PERSON> Cengis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciskun </PERSON> <PERSON> Seytan </PERSON>, was arrested last week after slipping through the fortified no-man's - land separating Turkish-occupied northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> from the Greek Cypriot `` It's been decided that he should be deported to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and not prosecuted here,'' <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> police chief <PERSON> Anastasis </PERSON> <PERSON> Prastitis </PERSON> said. Last summer, <PERSON> Seytan </PERSON> married 15-year-old <PERSON> Alexia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chronia </PERSON>, whose family belongs to a dwindling community of about 1,000 Greek Cypriots living in the <LOCATION> Karpas </LOCATION> district of northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The wedding received much publicity. Greek Cypriot authorities claimed Miss <PERSON> Chronia </PERSON> had been abducted, forcibly converted to Islam and forced to marry Seytan. But <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials who investigated said the teen-ager, who had attended high school in the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> sector, denied she was kidnapped and claimed she was in love with <PERSON> Seytan </PERSON>. Last month, however, she returned to the south declaring she had been forced to marry <PERSON> Seytan </PERSON> and that he had threatened to harm her parents if she refused. After hearing that <PERSON> Seytan </PERSON> had come south to find her, the bride again changed her story. `` I love <PERSON> Cengis </PERSON>, but my family forced me to say I was kidnapped to cover up the shame of my conversion to <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> has been partitioned since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded the north of the island following an Athens-inspired coup aimed at union with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. Seytan is one of about 50,000 Turkish settlers brought to northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to boost the area's Turkish Cypriot minority.

 Authorities in <LOCATION> Baoan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> have shut down all 16 of the area's massage parlors because of links to prostitution, an official daily said Saturday. Baoan is the latest of several places in <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province and other areas of prosperous southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to move against massage parlors offering illicit sex to newly rich Chinese and visitors from nearby <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. The overseas edition of the People's Daily said the county began closing the parlors and removing their shop signs Jan. 21. The women working in the shops, many of them recruited from rural areas outside <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION>, were sent home. The daily said massage parlors in <LOCATION> Huidong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, to the east of <LOCATION> Baoan </LOCATION>, are also being closed. Prostitution, virtually wiped out by the Communist government after 1949, has made a comeback with the loosening of social and economic controls in recent years.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 City high school students are taking lessons in fear these days, and their teachers are the Decepticons _ a loosely organized gang of young thugs who have assumed near-mythical status. While the gang, which preys largely on fellow teen-agers, is responsible for only a small part of youth crime in the city, educators say its impact goes far beyond its reality. `` The idea of the Decepticons has a lot of power over the kids. It's a symbol of something bad. Like, ` the boogey man is coming, the Decepticons are coming,''' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, formerly a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> principal and now the superintendent of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> high schools. The drug rings that have gradually replaced most of the city's old neighborhood-based youth gangs are more violent and make a lot more money But the `` Decepts,'' who emerged about three years ago and named themselves after a group of cartoon characters, have gained a unique hold on the imagination of high school students as a horde of rowdies preying on easy victims near schools, taking anything from earrings to expensive sneakers. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said the mere rumor that the Decepticons were going to invade her <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> high school a couple of years ago brought the police out and prompted many parents to keep their children at home. The Decepts failed to show up; in fact, they've never been known to actually invade a school building. A group of students leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> several days ago all knew of the Decepticons' reputation and said many teen-agers feared them `` They steal bus passes, sneakers, gold jewelry, anything,'' said one boy who declined to give his name. But he and the other youths said they had never actually encountered the Decepticons and knew no one who had. There are 56 known members of the Decepticons, including 14 girls who call themselves Deceptinets, police said. Gang members, who come from all over the city and range in age from 15 to 22, typically hang out near a school during lunch breaks or after classes and occasionally mug a vulnerable youngster. They generally gather first at a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> high school and then commute to <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> where they can seek victims around several high schools along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> subway lines, said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Muir </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> safety committee. The Decepticons have attained their notoriety largely because `` they're the only game in town,'' <PERSON> Muir </PERSON> said. Drug rings, with their tremendous profits, lure most of the youths who would have been drawn to the old-style gangs and their turf battles, authorities say. `` You can certainly make a lot more money by selling drugs to kids than by stealing their sneakers,'' <PERSON> Muir </PERSON> said. During the early 1970s, the city had some 400 youth gangs with nearly 20,000 members. The police now know of 37 gangs with about 1,000 members, said Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galea </PERSON>, head of the police department's youth gang intelligence unit The Decepticons, named for fiendish, missile-hurling cartoon characters on television's `` The Transformers,'' are the largest and by far the most notorious of the remaining youth gangs. The Decepts wear no insignia or gang colors and dress like many other teens in designer clothes, expensive leather basketball shoes and lots of gold jewelry. They dress like other city youngsters, <PERSON> Galea </PERSON> explained, `` because they steal the other kids' clothes.'' They arm themselves with ax handles, hammers, box cutters, occasionally knives, but they rarely carry guns, <PERSON> Galea </PERSON> said. Almost exclusively, their victims are their peers. Five Decepticons were arrested on assault charges last year, and gang members were charged in 43 robberies, mostly involving thefts of clothing and jewelry, police said. The reality of the gang is that it exists. The mythology is that it is everywhere in large numbers, <PERSON> Galea </PERSON> said: `` We have reports that they're going to invade schools in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, all in the same day.'' <PERSON> Galea </PERSON> says the Decepticons are responsible for only a `` very, very small portion of youth crime.'' But the gang has a strong hold on the imaginations of many students who use the term `` Decepts'' for any group of violent teens. `` Their name is by far the most infamous; it does elicit fear,'' <PERSON> Galea </PERSON> said. `` As the kids travel throughout the city, this is the name they hear.''

North's courier to the Contras, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, wrote memos outlining the military needs of the guerrilla force and the names of some Central American officials assisting them. The government censored portions of some of the memos for use at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial, but last Monday night, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers found out that uncensored versions of the memos had become public eight months ago in a civil case. Adding fuel to the fire was the fact that two lawyers and the security chief in the office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> had been told Feb. 10 about the dissemination of the uncensored memos. On Tuesday, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the indictment based on prosecutorial misconduct and renewed old motions that the Classified Information Procedures Act should be declared unconstitutional as applied to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s case. On Friday, instead of the trial, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> held a hearing on <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s motions on constitutionality. He plans to rule this week. At the hearing, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> both criticized <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers for demanding too much disclosure and sought to reassure them. There can be cross-examination without disclosing `` every name, every security technique, every secret code that's in the case,'' said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. At another point, he said: `` I do n't want to kill anybody ... but beyond that ... you have an open door'' to disclose a substantial amount of sensitive material, a comment that should give <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies pause. The tension between national security concerns and <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s right to a fair trial promises to plague the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide's case to the end The trial _ in which opening statements were Feb. 21 _ could last up to five months. Tuesday afternoon found one of the prosecutors in the case, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromwich </PERSON>, sitting in the witness box trying to explain what happened after <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s lawyer mentioned to him Feb. 10 that he had given uncesored copies of the memos last June to the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an activist group opposed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bromwich </PERSON> said he informed the security officer in his office and then never gave the matter another thought. The other prosecutor present in the meeting also moved on to other matters, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, chief of the prosecution team in the North case. The security officer, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stansbury </PERSON>, said he decided to wait until after the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> security chief returned from vacation before taking any action to retrieve the memos. No one else was told, including <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers. North attorney <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> had been cross-examining <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> on Monday and had objected to the prohibition of the use of a high Costa Rican official's name in one of the Owen memos. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> met with the official while on an inspection trip for a possible site for an airstrip. The prosecution found out late Monday night that the news media was getting uncensored versions of the memos. Prosecutors quickly obtained approval from intelligence agencies to authorize unrestricted use at trial of the ones deemed relevant to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense However, the damage was done. `` An evidentiary hearing should be held to determine when the IC was first aware of the production of documents to the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, what efforts if any the IC made to prevent disclosure to the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, why the fact of public disclosure was withheld from the defense and the court while these matters were being hotly litigated in the course of Mr. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s cross-examination, and all other relevant information,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. Problems have arisen repeatedly in the case in connection with classified material and the law that governs its use. The prosecution was forced to seek dismissal of the conspiracy and theft counts in the indictment because attempting to prove them in court would have required disclosure of more classified material than intelligence agencies were willing to allow. The prosecution has been helped somewhat by the pre-trial disclosure provisions of federal law concerning use of classified material at trial. North's lawyers have been required to notify the government of all the classified documents they plan to use in court. Also required was a 162-page summary of classified testimony the defense plans to present. When the defense declined to explain what counts of the indictment to which it planned to tie the material, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> declared he was unable to rule on its admissibility and said he would rule as the trial proceeds. That approach triggered such serious concern in the intelligence community that on Feb. 9, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> began trying to delay the trial, while prosecutors declared their intention to proceed. The impasse was resolved when <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office agreed to establish a notification mechanism under which the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would be told anytime particularly sensitive information was about to be presented by the defense in court. The procedure would provide the government an opportunity to object.

 Authorities said Saturday they arrested three members of a right-wing terror group in connection with a plot to stage a prison break at a maximum-security prison. Police said the three were arrested Thursday afternoon when they claimed a suitcase at a suburban train station that contained a submachine gun, a pistol, ammunition, police uniforms and fake Italian army license plates.

<TEXT>
 The blood bath triggered by <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s attempt to revive its economy underscores the gravity of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s $ 420 billion foreign debt <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, the world's eighth-largest oil producer, has long been regarded as an oasis of prosperity and stability in a region swamped by poverty and political upheaval. But last week, rioting left at least 300 people dead. Venezuelans, accustomed to three decades of <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> rule, witnessed the specter of soldiers and tanks patrolling the capital under martial law. The disturbances broke out Monday when bus fares rose 30 percent by government decree. At the same time, prices on a range of basic goods and services such as gasoline, bread and electricity rose sharply under the government's economic-adjustment program, which also provided for a rise in interest rates and a currency devaluation. To offset price increases, the government doubled the mininum wage to the equivalent of $ 110 a month. But for many Venezuelans, the wage increases were cut in half by higher transport fares alone. President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> announced the measures Feb. 16, two weeks after taking office, to satisfy requirements of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and Western creditor banks. The main requirement was that <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> lift government subsidies that had kept prices artificially low for years. Had the government not imposed the price increases, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said Friday, it would have had no chance of obtaining $ 4.8 billion in loans from the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. He linked the civil unrest directly to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s $ 33 billion foreign debt, saying interest payments were consuming 70 percent of oil revenues and undermining the nation's ability to provide for its 18 million people. Moreover, the president said debt-burdened nations throughout <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> were vulnerable to similar uprisings spawned by economic hardship. `` I hope this painful sacrifice by our country will cause the leaders of the industrial powers to reflect that we are not exaggerating when we say the crisis is serious,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. According to a study last year by the Caracas-based Latin American Economic System, a regional think tank, the region spent $ 139 billion from 1982 to 1987 in servicing foreign debt. Not only did that not dent the obligation, debt actually grew over the period, mostly because of more loans just to pay interest. If the trend continues, the organization said, the standard of living of Latin Americans will not return to levels of the 1970s until the year 2000. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> is the region's fourth-largest debtor behind <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, at $ 114 billion; <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, at $ 106 billion; and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, at $ 54 billion. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, however, is one of the few developing countries that has been trying to repay debt, dipping into reserves built up before the collapse in world oil prices in 1986. The others simply reschedule their debt. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, with a foreign debt estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> at $ 19 billion, has paid almost nothing on its debt since President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> in 1985 imposed a ceiling on debt payments of 10 percent of the nation's export income. Its foreign reserves have since run out, and the country has entered into a steep recession. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s government is seeking to defer further interest payments on its foreign debt until September. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said any decision on delaying payment beyond that will depend on the success of his new economic program. The major debtor nations have been urging creditor nations for years to come up with a comprehensive plan for solving the debt crisis, but no formula has emerged. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banker based in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> said the Latin debt crisis could be traced mainly to ill-conceived government economic policies. He said <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> had dealt with its huge debt by printing more money, creating an annual inflation rate of 3,000 percent. In <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, the banker said, successive governments have tried to win popular support by maintaining low prices through subsidies. `` The fact is they have pursued policies that would have brought them to the edge of economic ruin regardless of debt,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. For example, gasoline, which rose in price 80 percent, had been selling for 6 cents a gallon. The crunch started in the early 1980s, as an oil glut forced prices down and the standard of living of most Venezuelans fell. Oil revenues account for 90 percent of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s foreign exchange earnings. For many Venezuelans, the government's austerity measures confirmed that the days of prosperity were over. Years of pent-up frustration were vented in the bloodiest rioting the country has seen. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said Venezuelans could expect at least six more months of economic hardship before the economy begins to expand.

 Up to the midnight hour, federal mediators were holding out a glimmer of hope that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> might settle with its Machinists union, but in the end a 17-month deadlock remained unstuck. The two sides were about as far apart as labor and management can get: $ 200 million. The airline, facing $ 1 million-a-day losses, wanted its biggest union to take a 15 percent to 26 percent pay cut totaling $ 150 million. The union wanted 8 percent salary increases for its 9,100 members at a cost of $ 50 million, but offered in the final hours to start with a 15-month freeze, chief negotiator <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said Saturday. Each side characterized the other's position as outrageous. Accusations flew back and forth: The company was out to bust the union. Organized labor wanted a strike to test President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Parent company <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> wanted to chop up and sell off the 60-year-old airline. The union wanted a better deal than other employees who already had taken cuts. Management wanted a better deal than other airlines who operated at a profit without cutting salaries. Overshadowing the charges and countercharges was already shaken public confidence in air travel because of recent accidents and terrorism, controversy over corporate takeovers such as the one that absorbed Eastern into the nation's largest airline company, and questions about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s relationship with organized labor in the first months of his administration. These and other issues affecting aviation loomed over the final negotiations leading up to 12:01 a.m. Saturday when <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, the president of the Eastern local, declared: `` It's shut down.'' Pressure on both sides to reach a settlement came mostly from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which handles labor disputes in the transportation industry. Federal negotiator <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickford </PERSON> had spent more than a year trying to get the two sides together. Other pressures early on pointed to a strike. Organized labor declared strong support for the union, including pledges to honor picket lines no matter where they are set up. Eastern advertised the editorial support it was getting in its efforts to prevent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from stepping in to stop a strike. On Thursday, mediation board Chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> had expressed strong optimism over the first new <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> proposal in months, enthusiastically telling a news conference it offered a possible `` breakthrough'' in the talks. It became clear on Friday, however, that there was n't going to be a breakthrough. About three hours before the midnight Friday end of a federally imposed 30-day cooling-off period, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said the union had rejected the new offer, which only slightly toned down the proposed salary cuts. But that was not the end of the negotiation in what was supposed to be a secret <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> location. Reporters, photographers and television crews gathered in the final hours on the sidewalk in front of the downtown Radisson Park Terrace Hotel to buttonhole negotiators as they entered and left. Hotel officials ushered journalists out of the hotel lobby, but periodically sent out hotel personnel to serve free coffee. Eastern's team already had set up shop at a different location, which did remain secret. Much of the final bargaining was over the phone, said <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>. But a half dozen times during the evening, Eastern negotiators arrived and then left, refusing to talk with reporters. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 3,500 pilots, also walked in and out of the meetings, but said little about the talks after issuing a statement threatening what they said would be safe and legal steps that would `` substantially delay'' flights nationwide. Union negotiators remained silent to the outside world. Later, Eastern chief negotiator <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> told reporters the company made several offers in the last hours, but accused the union of never waivering from its original demand. He said the company had modified its proposals to soften pay cuts. Its major new offer would have reduced hourly top-scale wages from $ 18.83 to $ 16 for aircraft mechanics and from $ 15.60 to $ 11.54 for baggage handlers, with no hope of increases for five years. The cuts were a few cents kinder than the offer Eastern stuck with during months of talk, but they were still too harsh for the Machinists. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s bargaining demands were virtually the same as they had been since the beginning. The union, on the other hand, offered a 12-month wage freeze, then a 15-month freeze, in its final efforts to avert a strike. Union demands included sweeping measures such as guarantees from Eastern that it would rebuild itself to its former size. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has sold off some of its assets and is awaiting <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> approval to sell <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s lucrative Northeast air shuttle services to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. Company officials have accused the union of trying to run the business. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, in declaring national support for the Machinists before the strike, accused <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> of trying to destroy Eastern. `` What the facts will show,'' said <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, `` is that Mr. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has found it worth his while to purchase a good comapny and strip its assets, rather than operate it fairly and decently.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> foreclosed the surest way to averting a strike when he announced nine hours before the deadline that he would not call an emergency panel that would have delayed a walkout by at least 60 days. His decision came despite recommendations from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, 33 Senators and labor unions that he step in. In what was viewed by many in organized labor as the first major test of his dealings with the union movement, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did exactly what management had asked: nothing. It was clear that when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his decision, he knew settlement was unlikely. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, shortly after meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said all the information he had pointed to a strike. `` It is time for this dispute to come to an end. It makes no sense whatsoever to let these skirmishes and drawn out negotiations continue for another 60 days,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. One of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s offers in the final 90 minutes said the union could walk off the job for 48 hours and get full pay for employees while they vote on whether to ratify the strike. That, too, was rejected. After it was all over, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> declared, `` We will continue to bargain. ... Strikes are not the end; they are the beginning of another period of time.''

 In his 83rd year, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> has emerged from a studied silence with a brief novella, a meditation on old age that a reviewer praised as `` another of <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s nihilistic mantras, best mumbled aloud.'' Only 200 copies of `` Stirrings Still,'' the 1,801-word new work by the Nobel Prize-winning author of `` Waiting for Godot,'' are being printed. They are offered for sale at $ 1,720 each. `` The way they've gone this morning, they'll be gone by next week,'' publisher <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Calder </PERSON> said Friday, after the entire novella was published in The Guardian newspaper. The signed, limited edition includes illustrations by the Irish artist <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBrocquy </PERSON>, who also illustrated an edition of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>'s `` Dubliners,'' <PERSON> Calder </PERSON> said. A mass-market edition will be published, he said, but not for a couple of years. <PERSON> Calder </PERSON> said `` Stirrings Still'' was written in response to pleas from <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s American publisher, <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossett </PERSON>, formerly of <ORGANIZATION> Grove </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, though there are no immediate plans to print it in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It is a tale, reviewer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kermode </PERSON> wrote in The Guardian, that is typical <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> _ `` of a featureless man in a virtually featureless world, expressing a condition in which everything that characterizes some of our normal assumptions about human existence ... is virtually annulled, in prose rich only its unmatched parsimony.'' Given the price, <PERSON> Kermode </PERSON> said, `` purchasers can henceforth meditate the destitution of their existence and simultaneously take pleasure in their privilege.'' This paragraph is typical of the style of the opus: `` A clock afar struck the hours and half-hours. The same as when among others <PERSON> Darly </PERSON> once died and left him. Strokes now clear as if carried by a wind now faint on the still air. Cries afar now faint now clear. Head on hands half hoping when the hour struck that the half-hour would not and half fearing that it would not. Similarly when the half-hour struck. Similarly when the cries a moment ceased. Or merely wondering. Or merely waiting. Waiting to hear.'' Born in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> and educated at <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1928 and became acquainted with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, the Irish novelist and poet who became the subject of <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s first published essay a year later. <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> eventually decided to live in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, saying he preferred `` <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in war to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in peace.'' He has continued to live in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, writing both in French and English. His last work, <PERSON> Calder </PERSON> said, was a novella titled `` Worstword Ho'' in 1982. `` Stirrings Still'' is hardly <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>'s most concise work. `` Breath,'' a 1969 theater piece, consisted of a pile of rubbish, a breath and a cry, lasting no more than 30 seconds.

<HEAD>Three Dead In Chain Collision Caused By Blowing Dust, Unknown Motorist</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A motorist who stopped on a highway during a blinding dust storm is believed to have started a chain reaction collision of 31 vehicles in which three people were killed, police said. At least 40 people were injured. The motorist who stopped in a traffic lane on Interstate 10 in southeastern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> was not involved in the accident, and drove away before anyone recorded his license number, the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> said. Officer <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pittman </PERSON> said eight tractor-trailer rigs, a Greyhound bus and 22 cars were involved in the accident in the middle of the afternoon Friday. `` It was total black. You could n't see the road,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Host </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the driver of a tractor-trailer rig that struck the Greyhound bus. He suffered only a bruised arm. Wreckage was still being cleared away Saturday. The entire front of the bus, en route from <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was sheared off when it collided with another vehicle after being struck from the rear by <ORGANIZATION> Host </ORGANIZATION>'s truck. `` You do n't have no protection up there -LRB- in the driver's seat -RRB-,'' said bus driver <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. Black, 43. `` It's just fiberglass and thin metal. I'm very glad to be alive.'' Black, of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, said most of his 25 passengers were treated for minor injuries. A bus official said a pregnant woman was admitted to a hospital for observation. <PERSON> Rik </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 36, was on his way from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in his new pickup. He said he saw a jackknifed tractor-trailer on the road in front of him, and started pulling off toward a ditch on the left. `` Then I looked in the rear-view mirror and saw a bus skidding toward me,'' he said. `` I opened the door to get away. I was just out the door when the bus hit my truck.'' `` If I had been in the vehicle, my head would have gone right through the windshield,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. At least two of the dead were believed to be out-of-state truckers, <PERSON> Pittman </PERSON> said. The injured were taken to hospitals in <LOCATION> Willcox </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Will Tower Episode Spawn New Ethical Climate in Senate?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Returning to his Capitol Hill office one night last week, Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> jokingly told a reporter: `` This is the last time I'm riding in an elevator with a woman who's not my wife.'' Black humor remarks like those of the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Republican, spawned by the controversy over <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s alleged drinking and womanizing, were common in the corridors of power and underscored the ticklish nature of the debate over President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominee for defense secretary. So sensitive were senators that one telephoned a reporter at night simply to make sure it was clear his comments about a colleague's fondness for `` bimbos and booze'' were made in jest. `` Times have changed in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, a Tower defender who vowed to put the spotlight on any senator thought to be engaging in improper behavior in the future. Tower, a 24-year <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> veteran who is facing an uphill battle in his drive for confirmation, tried to turn the tables on his former colleagues by demanding that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` articulate what its own standards are'' on drinking as well as accepting honoraria, campaign contributions and vacations from special interest groups. Tower's challenge did not fall on deaf ears. Some senators said the historic debate might lead to reforms in campaign financing and even produce a stricter ethical climate in the nation's capital where social habits have already changed over the last decade. Tower raised the money issue as a counterpoint to critics who said he was too cozy with the defense industry because his consulting firm accepted about $ 1 million in consulting fees from defense contractors over the past two years. `` I accept that the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> must adhere to a higher standard than members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' Tower said. `` But my question is, how much lower an acceptable standard is there for members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>?'' Senators drew a distinction between money and drinking issues and, in general, they defended their colleagues' behavior. `` I've been here 16 years and I've never seen one -LRB- senator -RRB- drunk on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., responding indirectly to Tower's implication that such activities took place Others disputed <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s claim. `` I've seen senators come to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor intoxicated,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, a teetotaler. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> refused to identify those he'd seen drunk. `` There have been abuses, no question about it,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill. And Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., said some senators continue to have `` grape and grain on their breath'' when they come to But on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, as in society as a whole, heavy drinking is not as common as it was in the past, observers say. The health-conscious `` yuppie generation is different,'' said manager <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Selimos </PERSON> at the Monocle Restaurant, a favorite watering hole for lawmakers, lobbyists and aides. <PERSON> Selimos </PERSON>, who was interviewed by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents about Tower's habits, said that when senators come to the bar `` half the time they drink soft drinks.'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ikard </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hostess, said the new capital mores stem in part from the advent of the `` power breakfast'' where politicians have to be fresh early in the morning. `` You can hardly get people to eat now ... to say nothing about smoking and drinking,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ikard </PERSON> said. That was n't always the case, according to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, the retired maitre d' of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> dining room. In a 1986 book entitled `` Capital Hill in Black and <PERSON> White </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> wrote of widespread drinking and womanizing. First elected to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1974, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he'd noticed a `` gradual improvement'' in the ethical climate in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` with the notable exception of campaign financing.'' He supports public financing of senatorial campaigns. `` I think it might'' said Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., when asked whether the Tower debate might lead to reforms in rules governing how campaigns are financed and what types of outside income they are allowed to earn in office The furor over the Tower nomination might spur <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to press forward on campaign reform, said <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> judiciary committee. Common Cause, the self-styled citizens' lobby, said the 100 senators kept a total of $ 2.3 million in honoraria in 1987. In the two-year election cycle, 1987-1988, the 33 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> winners in the 1988 election collected about $ 31 million from political action committees. Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, said it was too early to tell what longstanding changes might occur as a result of the Tower debate `` I just have to evaluate it when it simmers down,'' he said. But <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> said he hopes the biggest change will be a new reluctance on the part of politicians to say, `` I'm not going to answer personal and irrelevant questions.''

<TEXT>
 With senators feeling little pressure from back home to support <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, backers of the embattled nominee for secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> are blaming the White House for failing to generate grassroots political heat on behalf of the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator. `` They never put a campaign together,'' said <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, who orchestrated grassroots campaigns as <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> political director. `` It has never been reduced to an ideological issue out in the country,'' said Republican consultant <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>. `` So Democrats from conservative states, say <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, for example, they feel no pressure from rank and file voters to vote for Tower. `` It has never been posed in an ideological framework. We're voting over whether this guy is a drunk and womanizer or not. One indicator of the lack of pressure is the volume of mail reaching the Capitol. An aide to Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat had received a total of 260 letters on the Tower appointment, most of them opposed to confirmation. By contrast, during the fight over the nomination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> received more than 55,000 letters and telegrams. A similar report came from the office of Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat still listed as undecided. An aide said that during the past week, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had received 1,978 letters, telegrams and phone calls opposed to Tower and 1,649 supporting him. `` The political pressures on this are pretty much a wash,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s press secretary. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, a spokesman for Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Democrat leading the fight against Tower, said, `` The volume of mail is not anything like it was with <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> has a much higher profile on this one.'' `` <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> was an ideological fight,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and one of a group of conservative leaders urged by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at a White House meeting on Wednesday to try to generate support for Tower. `` There was no cover -LRB- on <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>. `` There was no subterfuge. <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> was being deprived of confirmation to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> because of what he believed.'' In the Tower debate, continued <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>, senators are saying that's not the case `` It's these personal problems,'' he said. `` That may be only partially true, but at least it gives them the cover.'' `` The <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> thing was much more intense out in the hinterlands,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, Republican National Committeeman from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` There has n't been a great groundswell out here -LRB- on Tower -RRB- or really any great contact from the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooper </PERSON>, a party official from <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, said, `` I'm all for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>. ... But at the same time, it's not that traumatic. I'm all behind the president getting his way, but if we lost it, you just go to somebody else. <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON>, a Republican political consultant, said he just returned from a trip to several states. `` You know what never comes up? <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>. Maybe, three people brought it up. ... With the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, it as an issue that has no impact on them one way or the other.'' The past week, the president stepped up his efforts to generate support for Tower. `` At this late date,'' said <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> `` when you've drawn the political lines, it's awfully hard to get any significant Democratic votes.'' The former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> aide speculated that the White House `` never took the thought that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> might be in trouble seriously.'' In addition, <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> and others noted that conservative activists are split on the Tower nomination. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, was the first witness before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to allege that Tower had a drinking problem. `` There was a series of things that suggested to conservatives that this was not a fight to get into because nobody in the administration really cared that much about it,'' said <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>. Was that an accurate impression? `` No, I think it was reflection of the fact that they -LRB- the White House -RRB- may not have it together yet,'' he replied.

<HEAD>Alar Controversy Rocks Apple Industry</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The great American apple, baked in a pie and teamed with motherhood as the symbol of all that is wholesome, is once again under attack for health risks. Alar, a chemical used to make apples crisper and more colorful, was labeled a possible carcinogen last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, adding more fuel to nationwide concerns. That is an ironic twist for an industry that spends millions of dollars each year promoting the healthful aspects of apple consumption. Most growers have voluntarily halted the use of Alar, fearing bad publicity more than bad production. But many are bitter over a furor they say is unnecessary and unfair. `` There is absolutely no imminent health risk in eating apples or apple juice or apple sauce or any other apple product,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which has a grower-financed $ 14 million annual budget to promote apples around the world. Alar is the trade name for daminozide, a chemical growth regulator marketed by <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> announced last month that it intends to ban Alar by 1990, but for now it is still legal to use. The cancer risk from Alar was not so bad as to warrant an immediate ban, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. Apples are a huge business in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where 5,000 growers produced more than $ 300 million worth of apples last year. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> grows half the nation's supermarket apples, with thousands of workers employed in packing and shipping the fruit, and making juice, applesauce and other products. The industry feels threatened by last week's <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> report warning that eating Alar-treated apples increased cancer risk, especially in children. The report found that children who consume large amounts of fruit and fruit juice face a cancer risk of about one case for every 4,200 preschoolers exposed to Alar. The report has been attacked by some scientists and the acting <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> head as misleading and promoting hysterical fears. It is also a frustrating public relations problem for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> growers, and the industry is launching a counterattack. `` It's not illegal and not in any way harmful to anybody's health,'' said <PERSON> Marv </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundquist </PERSON>, who co-owns 600 acres near <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> `` There are so many other things we consume every day that have so much greater risk than this would have.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> contends only about 5 percent of the acreage is sprayed with Alar. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> puts the figure at about 7 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> estimates are somewhat higher, but no one really knows for sure how much Alar is sprayed because its use is not regulated. Uniroyal has said Alar sales are down 75 percent since Alar fears were first raised in 1985. Alar is not a pesticide, and it ca n't be washed off the apples by the consumer. It is sprayed on trees in the spring and acts to keep apples on the tree longer. That makes harvesting easier, improves the apples' color and firmness, and extends their shelf life. The most recent reports about Alar are already hurting apple sales, which were showing a decline by the end of the week. `` Shipments are slow,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON>, president of the Snokist apple cooperative in <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>, on Friday, adding that Alar fear `` is the only thing I can point to.'' The Alar dispute hits growers in the pocketbook in more ways than one. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers want crunchy, colorful apples, and they simply can not be produced in national volume without chemicals, St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. `` When you ask the consumer, ` Will you buy something that is not as appealing or crunchy -LRB- but not treated with chemicals -RRB-?' they'll tell you, ` Yes, I would,''' he said `` But we know from actual practice in supermarkets that they do n't. `` Americans have been so preconditioned that everything we purchase must be the biggest and best,'' he said. `` Our lower grades of apples are n't as appealing ... and we are not able to sell them.'' Nevertheless, many major grocery store chains, like <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION>, contend they accept no Alar-treated apples. Major juice makers like <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Top </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in the <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Selah </PERSON>, say the same. But a recent Consumer Reports study found Alar residues in 23 of 32 apple-juice samples it tested. The magazine did not identify which brands it tested. The chemical first came under a negative spotlight in 1985, and by 1986 the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was recommending that growers not use it. The industry has hoped that the completion of extensive tests on Alar would clear it for use. But the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> announcement last month that it planned to ban Alar, on the basis of preliminary testing, was viewed as a major setback. It is only the latest apple industry chemical to come under fire. Earlier this century, growers sprayed orchards with lead arsenate in an effort to kill codling moth. That drew the ire of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and overseas customers. Nicotine was later tried, but was expensive and made applicators sick. When DDT came into use in 1947 it was considered a miracle, but was ultimately banned by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Administration Decides to Allow Transfer of Jetfighter Technology

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has decided to proceed with a controversial deal under which a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense contractor would work with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in developing and producing an advanced version of the F-16 fighter, congressional sources said Saturday. They said that following an interagency review, the administration was expected to send formal notification of the technology transfer agreement to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on March 13. There is opposition on Capitol Hill to the plans to transfer to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> $ 7 billion in advanced American aircraft technology that would enable <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to build a proposed FSX fighter to upgrad its air capabilities by the late 1990s. Under the pending agreement, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> would join forces with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> to co-develop and co-produce the next-generation fighter. A congressional source, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said, `` There are going to be some changes in the agreement to control and monitor what type of technology flows.'' The source said that chances appear to be slim that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be able to block the deal by passing resolutions of disapproval. `` It's really long odds to stop it,'' he said. `` It's possible, but it would be tough, very tough.'' A group of 21 senators introduced last month a sense-of-the-Senate resolution declaring they have `` strong reservations'' about the FSX deal. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, 24 congressmen have sent a letter to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saying that they intend to fight the agreement when it goes to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, who had led opposition to the FSX within the administration, has now been mollified by the compromise worked out in the review process. Proponents of the <ORGANIZATION> FSX </ORGANIZATION> deal say it is the best that could be negotiated _ in view of Japanese refusal to buy wholly American-built planes _ and that it fosters beneficial technology transfer in both directions with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> while generating income and jobs for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry. Critics, however, contend that the agreement amounts to a technological giveaway that will enable the Japanese to compete more effectively against this country in the global aviation market. They argue that <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> should purchase American-made fighters to help offset the $ 50 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. General Dynamics, this country's No. 2 defense contractor, has said that under the deal, it and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies will receive 35 percent to 45 percent of the $ 1.2 billion being spent on development of the FSX as well as a comparable share of the $ 5 billion production program.

 A class in Christian protest where the final exam may involve being arrested is teaching prospective deacons in the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> how to translate their faith into action. `` Primarily, I'm hoping to get across that worship and liturgy are always inherently political because it has to do with ordering of life in the community,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie-Kellerman </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> pastor from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> discussed the course on a recent winter Saturday as he led a half-hour protest at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, where scientists have conducted research involving mustard gas and nerve agent weapons. Even though the class of about 25 members drew little attention as they sang hymns and read from the Bible, <PERSON> Wylie-Kellerman </PERSON> said the protest was important. `` Impact is often more than what is immediately visible,'' he said. The course is offered for credit to students in the Episcopal deacon program of the <ORGANIZATION> Whitaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> of Theology in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, or to anyone else who wants to transform religious beliefs into activism. Each class includes a Bible study and a protest worship service against activities such as an institution's military research, weapons construction or investments in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The class has been called a course in protest, but <PERSON> Wylie-Kellerman </PERSON> refers to it as a liturgical response to militarism. `` Liturgy is always political because there's a fundamental pledge of allegiance. Worship and liturgy declare an allegiance to the sovereignty of the word of God.'' Worship can take on a whole new meaning when a setting changes, he said. `` The same identical prayer service done in a cathedral, moved to the gates of <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, you're going to hear the call for repentance in a different way,'' he said, referring to the cruise missile engine plant in <LOCATION> Walled </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> where he will conduct a Pentecost service May 13. `` It's the same commitment and allegiance, but it just cuts you deeper. One of my clearest personal senses involved doing an Easter vigil liturgy at <ORGANIZATION> Wurtsmith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Base: cutting the fence and walking down the runway toward the high-security area, looking down at the B-52s and renouncing Satan, renewing my commitment to Christ.'' Members of the class say public witness is important. `` We're talking about taking the gospel and trying to live the gospel in such a way that what we do in worship really makes a difference in the way we live our lives,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Huntington </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>. `` We're trying to make a connection between Sunday and the rest of the week.'' `` We need to go out of that beautiful little cocoon -LRB- a church -RRB- onto the streets where people are killing and raping, making weapons that are going to kill. In terms of protest, or marking particular sites, it's making a public witness of our belief.'' `` It's an issue of peace and justice,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, who hopes to become a deacon candidate. `` Bill has taught me how to relate scripture to contemporary society.'' <PERSON> Wylie-Kellerman </PERSON>'s course will conclude in May, when members of the class may participate in civil disobedience and could be arrested at <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> as many other protesters have. `` We're programmed to feel we do n't make a difference. That type of thinking can immobilize you,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. `` It's good to be nurtured within a group, as small as it is.''

<HEAD>Archivists See Progress In Preservation of Historic Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After years of bewailing the disintegration of the nation's historic records, librarians and archivists say they are beginning to see progress toward preservation of documents ranging from the Declaration of Independence to fashion sketches from the 1920s. `` I think it's beginning to come of age after all these years of talking about it,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON>, director of the national preservation program of the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said after a three-day conference on statewide preservation programs that ended Friday at the library. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION> says it has been estimated that more than 80 million volumes in American research libraries and more than 2.5 billion pages in state archives are in danger of being lost because of the paper's acid content. Most book paper manufactured since the middle of the 19th century has a high acid content, which helps prevent the ink from running but also makes the pages turn brittle. In less than 100 years, they fall apart. Custodians of books and records have been concerned about the problem for years, but often have had trouble getting state and federal money to deal with it. `` State legislators are interested in potholes, they are interested in environmental problems, they are interested in nuclear waste sites,'' said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON>' deputy. `` It is not that they do n't care about history, but they sometimes have to be educated as to why the records are important.'' Apparently, the message is getting through. In 1987, for example, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> provided $ 500,000 to assist libraries, historical societies, archives and similar agencies preserve books, manuscripts, photographs, maps and other material. One grant went to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fashion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> to treat its collection of 5,568 pencil, ink, and watercolor drawings done by anonymous studio artists from 1915 to 1929. They were dismounted from brittle paper, mended, labeled and stored in acid-free folders and boxes. Other grants went to preserve such items as farmers' account books and tavern records from the 19th century, a <ORGANIZATION> Fordham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> collection including orderly books of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Juilliard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s collection of early and first editions of the compositions of <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Liszt </PERSON>, records of the black history of <LOCATION> Smithtown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and a <ORGANIZATION> Yeshiva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> collection detailing the history of three organizations that helped Jews during two world wars. Among other states with active programs are <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has increased funds for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> from $ 4.5 million in fiscal year 1988 to $ 12.3 million for the current fiscal year, which began last Oct. 1. The office supports cooperative microfilming projects and preservation of collections. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the grant-making body of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>, has a current appropriation of about $ 4 million and has funded more than 100 projects to develop government archives and records management programs in states, counties and cities. `` We have had a very, very good record on this in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this past year,'' despite deficit-cutting pressures to keep spending down, <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> also has installed an imaging system designed to monitor the condition of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and other basic documents. An Archives fact sheet distributed at the conference said the system takes pictures so precise that comparisons over time will detect the subtlest changes in a document. Meanwhile the <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> expects to be finished in a month or two with an experimental program at a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> pilot plant on technology to remove acid from books. `` The technologies are starting to come up, and people are starting to get into the mode for buying them, and pretty soon we're going to be doing it,'' <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> said With all the progress, however, he said, `` If you look at the general problem, it's something that we are behind on, only because we just do n't have the effort level high enough. Not everybody is on the bandwagon yet, but people are beginning to realize this is a problem.''

<TEXT>
 The economic and social turmoil that rocked <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> last week has put pressure on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to review Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s plan for dealing with the international debt crisis facing many Latin American countries. `` Time is running out,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a specialist on international debt. `` Today's crisis is with <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. Tomorrow's could be <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' Meanwhile, the administration is moving to arrange a temporary loan to help ease <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s plight in which at least 300 people were killed and 2,000 injured in riots in response to an economic austerity program designed by the new government of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. He is faced with a crushing $ 33 billion foreign debt owed to international banks and other lenders. <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials are putting the final touches on a $ 450 million emergency `` bridge loan'' to help the South American nation weather its economic crisis, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The loan is part of an international package from countries including <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other lenders such as commercial banks, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. Quoting government and banking officials, it said the emergency loans could total nearly $ 2 billion. The bridge loan is designed to replenish <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s depleted reserves over the next few months until longer-term loans from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> can be worked out. Under an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> agreed to adopt its austerity measures in exchange for a $ 4.5 billion loan over a three-year period. The international body is composed of 151 member nations, but its largest contributor is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Critics in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, and elsewhere, have pointed to the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>'s austerity requirements as being partly to blame for the turmoil But its defenders contend the requirements amount to bitter medicine that is long overdue. `` The country has its back to the wall and it has no other choice than to strengthen its economic situation at once,'' said an <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> official, who would speak only on condition of anonymity. `` We can send a signal to the rest of the world that by working to solve its problems, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> is doing the right thing.'' The official praised <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s new government for taking action swiftly, and emphasized that the austerity measures were of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s own design and not imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. He said that in other situations, critics of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> have used it as a `` whipping boy'' to deflect criticism. `` They have no choice but to swallow the medicine. But if it tastes bad, do you blame the doctor for that?'' he asked. One <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> official, who also spoke privately, said that despite the criticism directed against the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and other Western lenders, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s officials have been sincere about working out an economic reform plan. `` In this case, we have a real commitment on the part of <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> to stick with this,'' the official said. `` The adjustment is painful, no doubt about it,'' he said of the bloodiest civil unrest to strike the country in 31 years. But <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and other Latin American experts argue that emergency measures on the part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> _ while welcome _ are n't adequate to deal with the financial nightmares facing <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and other heavily-indebted Latin American nations. Besides an urgent review of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debt policy, several called for so-called debt relief, or a reduction of the debt burden. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> is the fourth largest debtor in the region, which has accumulated some $ 420 billion in foreign debt. Debt relief is not part of the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan, put forward when the Secretary of State ran the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He suggested economic reforms in the debtor nations, coupled with assurances of new private and public lending. The plan's critics point out that Latin leaders have lost faith in the scheme, since it appears to help commercial banks while forcing debtor nations to adopt policies that severely strain living standards and put their democracies in peril. `` I think there is no way that you can expect these countries to dig themselves out of a debt crisis through economic growth and without some debt reduction,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said Friday. `` We need a plan for debt reduction. ... I have high hopes the administration will move away from that plan to a new one.'' Sen. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and its subcommittee on the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, agrees there are many things the Latin American nations must do to refocus their economies, saying he does not disagree with some elements of the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan But the administration `` must do a more effective job, both politically and economically, on the debt question,'' he said. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> faults the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for placing too much emphasis on the Contra battle against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and not paying enough attention to the debt crisis. `` <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> should be a reminder to policy-makers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of not addressing the underlying problems of the Latin American nations,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said. Both the present <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, and a former envoy, <PERSON> Viron </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaky </PERSON>, voiced hopes in separate interviews that the Venezuelans will overcome the most recent turmoil. `` It is surprising, the volatility,'' said <PERSON> Vaky </PERSON>, who served as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador during <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>' earlier term of office in the late 1970s. `` They probably did n't prepare the people well enough for these price hikes, but I believe they'll be able to ride this out.'' <PERSON> Vaky </PERSON> echoed <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s call for debt relief, calling it `` <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s basic problem.'' <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, speaking in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, emphasized <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s importance to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, pointing out that it is the source of 7 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil imports. `` We definitely want to help,'' <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said, noting that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had telephoned <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> on Friday to voice support for his reform plans. `` The president's call was an indication of how close our relations are, and how we want to be of assistance. ... it is a vital link that ca n't be ignored.''

<HEAD>Detroit Newspaper Merger Blocked by Supreme Court Justice</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice on Saturday blocked, at least until March 17, the partial merger of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s two daily newspapers that was to begin Monday. Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, in an unexpected move, said the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and The Detroit News may not start the partial merger until the full <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> considers the issue at its next regularly scheduled closed-door conference, March 17. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> on Friday had refused to postpone the partial merger, and lawyers for opponents to the deal then turned to <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> for help. Reporters initially had been told that <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> was not going to act on the emergency request before Monday. A federal appeals court panel here voted 2-1 to uphold then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision to allow the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> papers to form a joint operating agreement under the federal Newspaper Preservation Act. The 1970 law empowers the attorney general to give financially failing newspapers an exemption from antitrust laws. Under the joint operating agreement, the two <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> newspapers would combine their business, advertising and production departments but maintain separate news and editorial staffs. By a 5-4 vote last month, the full appeals court refused to reconsider the three-judge panel's Jan. 27 ruling. The appeals court blocked the partial merger until March 6 so opponents could seek a longer delay from <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>. That delay was denied Friday. But <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, in a three-paragraph order issued Saturday, said he was referring the matter to the full court. His order added, `` It is further ordered that the order staying implementation of the joint operating agreement issued ... by the -LRB- appeals court -RRB- is continued pending further order of the court.'' A group of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> readers and advertisers who sued to stop the partial merger contend that the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, a morning newspaper owned by <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is not a failing newspaper even though it lost $ 10 million a year between 1981 and 1986. The opponents, calling themselves <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens for an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, say the Free Press and News, which lost $ 50 million in the same period, were unprofitable solely because both papers cut prices in an unsuccessful effort to force each other out of business. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the News, is the nation's largest newspaper publishing group. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> is the second largest. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> has threatened to close down the Free Press if the joint operating agreement is not approved. The opponents' emergency request said the agreement `` threatens the independence of daily newspapers in 25 cities'' where, like <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, competing newspapers still exist. The case is <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens for an Independent Press. vs. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, A-695.

 Two passenger trains collided outside <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today in an accident that killed up to 12 people, injured about 50 and sent carriages careening into the gardens of trackside homes, authorities and witnesses said. Authorities said one train hit the back of the other near the Purley station in <LOCATION> Surrey </LOCATION>, on the southern outskirts of the capital. One train remained on the track but seven cars from the other fell down an embankment into the gardens, the Fire Brigade said. There was no indication anyone was hurt in the houses, but firefighters had to cut dozens of passengers free from the wreckage. There were conflicting casualty reports. About five hours after the 1:39 p.m. crash, the emergency room chief at nearby <LOCATION> Mayday </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kambiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON>, said four people died there and six at the scene. The bodies of two women were reported at nearby <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, but it was not clear whether they were included among those dead at the scene. The Fire Brigade and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> said two people died. Fire officials put the injury toll at 50. British Rail said 32 people were injured. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> said it appeared that one train, traveling north to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Horsham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sussex </LOCATION>, had been crossing from the local line to a fast track when it collided with a train bound for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Littlehampton </LOCATION>, on the south coast of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` We presume at this stage that the other -LRB- <LOCATION> Littlehampton </LOCATION> -RRB- train was already on the fast lane but we do not know how they impacted,'' the spokesman said. On Dec. 12, a three-train crash near <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Clapham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> station, 10 miles to the north of today's accident, killed 35 people. Railroad officials blamed malfunctioning signals for that crash. In today's accident, one train ran into the back of another, plowed to one side, and slid down the steep embankment, Fire Brigade divisional officer <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> said. Seven carriages `` slid away and turned over,'' he said. <PERSON> Samantha </PERSON> <PERSON> Muggeridge </PERSON>, 16, who was waiting on the <LOCATION> Purley </LOCATION> platform, said: `` A slow train was coming toward <LOCATION> Purley </LOCATION> station. A faster one came up behind it and seemed to clip the back of it. `` Three carriages from the first train rolled down the embankment and others stayed on the tracks but they were twisted and tilted. `` There was a very loud crash after the collision followed by an eerie silence. Then doors of the train started to open and there were shouts from inside the carriages.'' People ran from their homes and helped evacuate some of the injured. Other injured made their own way to safety, some apparently driven to hospital by a man who had his car parked in the street. Ambulance crews raced to the scene and hospitals went on alert. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was `` very distressed'' to hear of the train crash and was being kept informed of developments, said a spokesman for her 10 Downing St. office. A public inquiry is currently under way into a Dec. 12 crash. State-run <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> has blamed its own flawed system in installing new signaling equipment for the crash. Railway officials believe malfunctioning signals led one commuter train to slam into the rear of another that was stopped on the tracks. An empty freight train on an adjacent line then plowed into the wreckage and apparently hit some passengers who had scrambled onto the tracks. The <PERSON> Clapham </PERSON> crash was the worst train wreck in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since 1975, when 43 people died in a subway train that crashed in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> tunnel.

 Soldiers on Saturday blocked roads and turned back hundreds of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace activists hoping to meet and discuss peace with Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the army restricted access for reporters while British Foreign Office Minister <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON> toured the Jabaliya refugee camp. At least two Palestinians were reported shot and wounded in violent protests that broke out after the visits. Angry activists of the Peace Now movement accused Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> of thwarting the meetings with Palestinians in Arab towns. `` We were n't planning assemblies or marches or protests _ just meetings,'' said Peace Now spokesman <PERSON> Tsali </PERSON> <PERSON> Reshef </PERSON>. One of the activists, <PERSON> Yochanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Spruch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, called the government `` plain stupid.'' <PERSON> Reshef </PERSON> called a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman and demanded an explanation for closing the roads. He quoted ministry spokesman <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> <PERSON> Haber </PERSON> as saying Peace Now did not receive permission for the visit. Parliament member <PERSON> Ran </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> of bowing to pressure from right-wing Jewish settlers who oppose the peace meetings. Settlement leaders launched a campaign Friday to stop the meetings and urged <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> to block the contacts, saying they would encourage terrorism. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official who demanded anonymity said the army was concerned Jews would clash with fellow Jews if the meetings took place. Five separate convoys of Israelis left <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beersheba </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> villages early on the <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabbath </PERSON>, and all were stopped by army roadblocks, activists said. In one case, activists headed for southern <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> abandoned their cars at army roadblocks and walked to the village of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahour </LOCATION>, where they held an impromptu peace rally, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said. After the Israelis left, one Palestinian was shot and wounded in clashes with troops, a photographer said. `` Defense Minister <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> is ready to let 365 days go by in which there are dead and wounded on both sides, but he wo n't let even one day go by in which the two sides talk to each other,'' said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. On the outskirts of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, a military officer blocked the road with his jeep to cut off a convoy from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The officer told convoy drivers that the area was a closed military zone, but troops then waved on local Arabs and Jewish settlers. Members of Peace Now, which calls for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to change its policy and negotiate with the banned <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, have held numerous meetings with Palestinians both inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and abroad. Several activists have met with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, ignoring the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> law barring contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Peace Now said it has been in contact with underground leaders of the anti-Israeli revolt and coordinated the meetings with their approval. At least 388 Palestinians and 17 Israelis have been killed in the nearly 15-month uprising against Israeli rule. Palestinian leaders in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> distributed a leaflet directing followers not to attack cars with Peace Now signs. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON> toured the Jabaliya refugee camp and said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would contribute $ 870,000 to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, to benefit Palestinian refugees. Reporters were not allowed to accompany him while he visited the camp outside <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In a brief news conference following the tour, <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON> said the continued military occupation was an `` utter impossibilty.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> gained control of the territories in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. After <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON>'s departure, troops wounded a Palestinian in the leg during a stone-throwing clash, an Arab reporter in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> said.

<TEXT>
 `` You think funny,'' a newspaper columnist once told <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Escambia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputy took that observation to heart and has turned his funny thoughts into a secondary career as a cop humorist. While some officers moonlight as security guards or bar bouncers, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, now a captain, has found an off-duty niche as a talk-show personality on local radio and cable television, a traveling convention and banquet speaker and an author. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> himself is the butt of the joke in most of his yarns, like the one about getting his foot stuck in a door that splintered when he tried to kick it in for a search. Other officers had to go through another door to help extricate him. `` It's not supposed to happen that way, but it always has, at least to me,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. `` I think all of us make mistakes in the profession. The difference is I write about mine.'' He started by giving a humorous tone to official police reports and now has written a book, `` You're Under Arrest _ I'm Not Kidding.'' The cover illustration depicts the bald, gawky and bespectacled deputy confronting a hulking bad guy. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> admits to bearing an uncanny physical resemblance to comedian <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Knotts </PERSON>, perhaps best known for portraying bumbling Deputy Barney Fife on television's `` <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> Show.'' After getting nothing but rejection notices from big-time publishers, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>, formed their own company, named it <ORGANIZATION> Caroldon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION> after themselves and published the autobiography on their own. The book has sold 1,800 copies in little more than two months, and is starting to find its way into bookstores along the Gulf Coast. The book is a rapid-fire collection of true stories. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s favorite is about the terrified woman who reported her house had been invaded by an alligator When <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> arrived, he discovered a harmless, 6-inch-long lizard. Another story is about the drunk pedestrian who flagged down <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, off duty, in civilian duds and driving his private car, to ask for a ride. The man said he had just wrecked his car and was trying to avoid being caught by a state trooper at the accident scene which <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> had just passed. `` Brother, this just is n't your day,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said, flipping open his badge case after inviting the man inside and doing a U-turn. Most laughs, however, are at <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s expense. He recounts helping a motorist change a flat tire only to discover later that the car had been stolen and the guy he had helped was the thief. Another time he was off duty looking over magazines at a neighborhood drug store while it was being robbed, something <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> did n't realize until a squad car, siren blaring, screeched to a halt outside. By then the robber was long gone. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said the late <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, a columnist for the <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, was accurate when she said he thinks funny. `` I'm always struck by the ... sheer incongruity of what happens to us as law enforcement officers,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. `` It's frequently so unlike what you see on TV.'' `` Barney Miller'' is the exception. He said the comedy was the most accurate of television police shows. `` The job is occasionally dangerous, frequently monotonous and often filled with moments of hilarity which occur at the most unexpected times.''

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of police occupied hospitals in the country's four main cities on Saturday to keep regular medical services running during a five-day strike by hospital workers. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> sent police armed with tear gas and M-16 rifles into the hospitals late Friday and ordered 4,000 nurses, cooks and administrators to return to work by Monday or lose their jobs. No violence was reported. `` Our purpose is to open the hospitals so that the employee who wants to work can do so,'' <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> said Friday. `` The ones who do n't do it will be sanctioned or fired and immediately replaced by someone who wants to work for the benefit of the people.'' He said the strikers, who are demanding higher wages, were `` violating the constitution by not attending to the public health.'' He and Public Health Minister <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Villeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> said the workers would lose their jobs if the strike did not end by Monday morning. <PERSON> Celeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Casildo </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the strike would continue. Since Tuesday, employees have been giving only emergency care while hundreds of people wait outside for non-emergency attention. `` We will continue defending our rights to the end,'' he said. `` The government promised to increase our salaries ... and it tricked us.'' Workers are demanding salary increases totaling $ 2.6 million annually. The average Honduran hospital worker earns about $ 200 a month. The health minister said the government can only give the workers annual total increases of $ 1.5 million `` because of the grave economic crisis facing <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.'' He said the medical workers have declared some 36 strikes in the past two years to demand what he called `` exaggerated'' salary increases.

<HEAD>Madonna Video Withdrawn After Charges It Is Blasphemous</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The distributors of rock star <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'s new single, `` Like a Prayer,'' decided not to release the video immediately on Italian television because of protests from a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> group, news reports said Saturday. The conservative <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> group <ORGANIZATION> Famiglia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Domani </ORGANIZATION> charged the video was blasphemous, and it threatened to go to court to block the broadcast, newspapers said. The video was to be shown Tuesday on the popular program `` Notte Rock'' -LRB- Rock Night -RRB- on state-run RAI television. Officials of <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'s Italian record company, WEA, announced after a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> RAI </ORGANIZATION> officials Friday they had decided `` to suspend the television distribution of this video for some days, to keep any more controversy from arising.'' Representatives of <PERSON> Famiglia </PERSON> <PERSON> Domani </PERSON> acknowledged they had not seen the video, first shown in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> on Friday at press screenings. According to Italian journalists who saw the video, it shows the following: The singer witnesses an attack on a girl by a group of white boys, who then escape. A black man who arrives on the scene is accused of the assault. <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, wearing a slip, seeks refuge in a Baptist church and pauses before a statue of a black saint, whose face becomes that of the accused man. The statue cries tears of blood and comes to life. The rock singer develops cuts in her hands resembling the wounds of the crucified body of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> gives the statue a kiss then goes to police and tells them the accused man is not guilty. Several newspapers said the screening should put to rest rumors the video would show <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> as a nun romantically involved with a crucified Christ. The Milan daily <ORGANIZATION> Corriere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> della </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sera </ORGANIZATION> said State Prosecutor <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossini </PERSON> had asked to see a copy of the video Friday. <PERSON> Famiglia </PERSON> <PERSON> Domani </PERSON> has threatened to seek court action to block broadcast of the video, newspapers said. `` In reality, this scandal should deflate like a bubble,'' the Rome-based <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION> said. `` But we are in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, and before a problem -LRB- racism -RRB- so ably raised by the puritan moralism of the Americans, we can be sure that the sexy slip that <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> wore into the church will be enough to irritate those who at all costs seek a public scandal.''

<TEXT>
 While the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee deliberates behind closed doors over a series of ethics charges against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, its complex probe is but part of a growing web of political intrigue surrounding the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat. Some Republicans are complaining that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has intervened in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s business to hamper a second ethics investigation into whether the speaker last September improperly disclosed a covert <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. And Republican political operatives have set <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> up as their `` No. 1 target'' in the 1990 elections and are using the speaker as a centerpiece in their long-range efforts to split the Democratic party and recapture control of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker traditionally has been a target of the minority party, which seeks to use him to personify the evils it sees in the majority. But with <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the attack has taken on personal tones. While the ethics committee has given little outward hint of the results of its independent counsel's expensive nine-month probe of the speaker's finances, talk in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> cloakrooms and corridors is that the investigation has been extremely thorough and the outcome will cause <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> severe political problems, if not legal ones. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is alleged to have abused his office for personal financial gain. This includes using a congressional aide to help compile a book on which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> earned some $ 55,000 in royalties, and using a condominium in his hometown of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> without paying full market value. He also is alleged to have lobbied federal officials improperly on behalf of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> savings and loan institutions and lobbied for a gas venture in which he had a financial stake. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has steadfastly denied violating any law or rule of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, although he has conceded he might have dome some things differently if he had them to do over. Soon after the outcome of that probe is known _ expected sometime the week of March 13 _ the ethics panel will turn its attention to the other, less-noticed case against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>: its inquiry into whether the speaker violated House rules against disclosing classified information. In an offhand remark last Sept. 20, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he had `` clear testimony from <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> people'' that the agency had sought to stir up public unrest in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to provoke an overreaction by the leftist Sandinista government. The remark appeared to violate rules against publicly disclosing <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> testimony, although <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> later denied doing so. That case is now `` on the back burner,'' said ethics Chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., but has not been ignored Interviews have been conducted with <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> staff members on the subject, he said. But Republicans are concerned that a classified report on a trip to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by four panel members in December has not been forwarded to the ethics panel, in part because the lone Democrat on the trip _ Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> _ disagreed with the document and declined to sign it. The report, according to sources, includes a conclusion that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s comments had a severe chilling effect on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s internal political opposition, effectively shutting down public political dissent and leading to threats of imprisonment for some opposition leaders Committee member Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-La </LOCATION>., declined to comment specifically on the report, which under committee rules is a classified document But he said his conversations with opposition leaders made it clear that they were dealt a setback by news stories about <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s comments. `` It seemed to be common knowledge,'' he said in an interview. `` There was a great deal of intimidation ... There does n't appear to be much more desire to demonstrate for fear of repercussions.'' <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> acknowledged that he did not sign the report because he disagreed with the weight given to the impact of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s comments, saying he saw that as a minor portion of the trip. But he appeared flabbergasted at the charge that the document was being improperly withheld from the ethics probe. `` That's totally off the wall,'' he said. `` The committee has been given everything they need. I do n't think this -LRB- report -RRB- is relevant.'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> would not say whether he had known about the committee's report But he said, `` I think all material is relevant'' to the ethics investigation. `` In these instances, damage assessment evaluations are routinely made. I would think that would be relevant.'' In recent weeks, the line between the speaker's ethics problems and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> politics has become increasingly blurred, in large part because of the political targeting of the speaker by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the admitted anti-Wright agenda of the speaker's chief accuser, Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, leader of a band of right-wing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans, sees his attempts to paint the speaker as a villain as a necessary step in creating a new political climate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that could lead to a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s analysis has found that most of the five major political realignments in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, there have been serious internal splits within the majority party and a shift in public perceptions that portrayed the majority as corrupt and illegitimate. The attack on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is aimed at helping create those conditions.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' jets sat idle in the fog at the nation's second-busiest airfield Saturday _ but not because of the weather. Striking mechanics virtually paralyzed <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> here, and normally bustling concourses were vacant except for pickets and clusters of frustrated fliers. Many would-be passengers were trying to get to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for connections to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, where they had paid reservations on cruise ships. Others were students heading for warmer climes over spring break. Eastern, which handles about a third of the traffic through <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, originally had 278 departures scheduled for Saturday. By noon, only two planes had left, both for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. One Eastern flight had arrived. Planes from other airlines roared on and off the runways, past row on row of Eastern jets sitting idle. Airport spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Braden </PERSON> said the effect of the heavy fog, which could have backed up departing flights, was lessened because of the canceled <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flights. But that was no comfort to the passengers holding Eastern tickets. In the terminal, some played cards to pass the time while others snoozed, using carry-on luggage for pillows. Many complained they were n't told of flight cancellations until the last minute. `` I was on the phone with Eastern every day since Monday, and they kept telling me, ` It's going to fly, it's going to fly,''' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, who was scheduled to meet a cruise ship in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> with his wife, <PERSON> Grace </PERSON>, and had made his reservations two months ago. `` We were on the phone three hours yesterday trying to get through to them and when we did, they told us at 4:30 -LRB- p.m. -RRB- that maybe it wo n't,'' he said. A frantic scramble ensued to get other tickets as far as <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Later Saturday morning, the Tunners managed to get on one of the two Eastern planes leaving for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, and were hoping they'd make it to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tunner </PERSON> said he was sorry for those on strike. `` But if we miss the ship, who's going to repay the $ 3,000 we paid for the cruise?'' he asked. It was suspenseful for the Tunners and the relatively few other travelers who managed to get on an Eastern plane. Strikebreakers loaded luggage onto a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 for Flight 843, bound for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> waited to see if a crew would report. Waiting passengers applauded when one pilot arrived. Later, the luggage was taken off and put on a smaller DC-9, which requires a smaller crew. The flight finally left for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> at 11:15 a.m., an hour and 45 minutes late, leaving many passengers behind. `` See you on the ship,'' one couple called to less-fortunate friends who did n't get on board. `` I hope you're right,'' came the reply. A second flight for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> left a few minutes later with those who did n't get on board the first plane, but airport officials said they did not know if Eastern would be able to get more planes out after that. Machinists and pilots picketed outside the terminal and in concourses where Eastern has flights. Nails were spread in an Eastern employee parking lot overnight, <PERSON> Braden </PERSON> said, but he said they were swept up and there was no damage. And most Eastern travelers were not going anywhere. `` Eastern was invisible,'' complained <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiessel </PERSON>, a college student from <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, who was on her way to <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> with a friend. `` We called and they said everything was normal,'' she said. After the strike canceled her flight, she and her friend were able to use their Eastern tickets to get as far as <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> flight. `` When we got here they said they could send us back home.''

 <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won a record number of seats in the last election but who failed in four tries to become prime minister, resigned Saturday after nearly 14 years as party leader. `` Now is the time for renewal, now is the time to pick a new man or a woman to take us the next step,'' <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> said as he announced his resignation in an hourlong speech to leaders of the opposition party. His voice breaking with emotion, <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> called on the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> to fight the new conservatism he said is sweeping <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and widening the gap between rich and poor. One party member attending the caucus shouted `` No!'' as <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> said he was quitting. It was not immediately clear when the popular politician will leave or when a party convention will be held to replace him. <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON>, 52, who has represented <LOCATION> Oshawa </LOCATION> southern <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> since 1968, spoke to 120 members of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, or governing body. His announcement followed months of speculation about his political future in the wake of Nov. 21 general election. Although the New Democrats won a record 43 seats, they remained in third place among the national political parties and failed to win a single seat in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, even though <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> learned French and campaigned vigorously there. Only a year earlier, the party had led in public opinion polls. After a bitter election campaign dominated by the free-trade agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> was re-elected prime minister and his right-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won 169 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> finished second with 82 seats. Both opposition parties opposed the free-trade agreement, which was supported by <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> said he favored amendments that would protect Canadian jobs he believes will be threatened by the accord. During his long tenure as party leader, <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> was credited with leading his party toward the political mainstream. `` As in the past, when I've reached a decision, I'm very happy and convinced that the decision I made is the right one,'' he said. <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON>, whose personal popularity always was higher than his own party's, had indicated earlier he might step down. After the election, he appeared tired and demoralized. He questioned publicly whether he had the energy to continue in his position. `` You have to have your whole heart and soul, in terms of commitment, especially in national politics,'' he said in January. `` In terms of my disposition at this stage of my life, am I going to go out there and give it 100 percent of my energy and whatever talents I have? Unless a person is willing to do that, they ought not lead a political party.''

 <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, a co-founder of the Older Women's League and the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Displaced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homemakers </ORGANIZATION>, has died at age 68, the league announced. Ms. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> died Friday at her home in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, of breast cancer, said league spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> was an indomitable woman who was fired by concern for displaced homemakers and older women _ women confronted by widowhood, divorce and sex and age discrimination,'' said <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasse </PERSON>, president of the Older Women's League. `` Women all across the country have lost a powerful force,'' <PERSON> Glasse </PERSON> said. `` She will be missed.''

Ms. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> knew first-hand the problems experienced by both. After her husband died in 1970 at age 71, `` she found herself unable to get a job because of age discrimination,'' the league said in a statement. The Older Women's League now has more than 17,000 members in 120 chapters nationwide, the league said. More recently, Ms. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Sommers </PERSON> wrote a book called, `` Women Take Care,'' about the experience of caregivers in this society. It was published after Ms. <PERSON> Sommers </PERSON>' death. During a national book tour, Ms. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> said that the caregiving movement should support those who choose not to be caregivers as well as to those who do. `` Although I chose to be a caregiver twice ... it's not a role that is everyone's cup of tea,'' she said. `` We must work together to prevent society from force-feeding it to the women simply because it is perceived to be a woman's role.

<TEXT>
 Up to 18 inches of new snow halted travel Saturday in much of the upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, forcing nurses to call for four-wheel-drive taxis to get to work, and a sudden cold wave shut down outdoor activities in parts of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Snow plows were taken off some roads because of low visibility in blowing snow, and snow drifted back onto some highways as soon as plows passed. Along the edge of the snow belt, thick fog slowed travel in southeastern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and delayed some morning flights at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> airport `` It's total demolition out there,'' said a police dispatcher in fog-bound <LOCATION> Cedarburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION> `` I hear the sheriff's department is going crazy with accidents.'' Southwestern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> was hardest hit by the snow, with 18 inches at <LOCATION> Worthington </LOCATION>, 16 at <ORGANIZATION> Wilmar </ORGANIZATION> and 15 at <LOCATION> Fairmont </LOCATION>. Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> got an even foot of snow Plows attempted to keep major roads clear in the <LOCATION> Worthington </LOCATION> area, according to the <LOCATION> Nobles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office, but snow drifted back after the plows passed. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakel </PERSON>, who runs <ORGANIZATION> Jake </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Willmar </LOCATION>, said his company had made 75 calls as of midday Saturday with a four-wheel-drive taxi. `` This morning it was really tough getting around. It was just deep. We're using a four-wheel-drive for our taxi business to get the nurses to work and people like that who had to go to work,'' <PERSON> Jakel </PERSON> said. `` Of course, now the plows have gone by and they're leaving about a four-foot drift on the end of everybody's driveway, so now the streets are getting fairly good but you ca n't get on them,'' he added. At least three deaths were blamed on the weather in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> since the snow started Thursday, including one man found in a field who apparently tried to walk for help after his car got stuck, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> had 11.9 inches of snow in three days and <PERSON> Huron </PERSON> got 12 inches. Portions of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s northern Lower Peninsula got an average of 8 to 10 inches of snow, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said, with numerous reports of snowdrifts up to 5 feet. `` Of course it's a matter of opinion, but overall this is maybe the worst weather we've had all winter,'' said weather service meteorologist <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ann </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. Northern and central Wisconsin also got heavy snow, including 15 inches at <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Altoona </LOCATION>, 12 inches at <LOCATION> Wausau </LOCATION> and 11 at <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> Plowing was suspended for several hours during the night on Interstates 90 and 94 in central <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> because blowing, drifting snow cut visibility, said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON>, maintenance supervisor for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. Three plows were involved in collisions. Southern Wisconsin got a mixture of freezing rain, sleet and drizzle that glazed roads with more than an inch of ice in some areas. And ice brought down power lines throughout southern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, causing scattered power outages, utility officials said. North-central <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> got 13 inches of snow at <LOCATION> Chadron </LOCATION> and 11 at Valentine and <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON>, and some highways were closed or reduced to one-lane travel. <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and his wife and two small children planned to leave <PERSON> Kearney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, Saturday on a trip from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> after spending two nights in a motel because of icy, snowy roads. `` The traveling was just too treacherous,'' he said. `` You do n't want to be off in a ditch. `` I think must people have decided to stay put,'' said <PERSON> Dalene </PERSON> <PERSON> Skates </PERSON>, a motel clerk in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. `` The wind is so bad it is really hard to drive. Most of the problem has been cars that have been blown into the ditch.'' Teeth rattled instead of snakes at <LOCATION> Taylor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, just northeast of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, where officials canceled the 17th annual National Rattlesnake Sacking Championship because of a vicious cold front. The temperature fell 34 degrees in eight hours, to a reading of 34 at noon Saturday. Temperatures in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> were 50 to 60 degrees colder than on Friday, the weather service said. The wind chill factor in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> shortly after noon was 9 below zero. Several college sporting events were canceled. The Six Flags Over <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> amusement park postponed its opening day for one week for the first time in its 29-year history, and sent workers rushing to return flowers to warm greenhouses. The cold also created icing problems at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport. `` We have canceled approximately 50 percent of our flights for the remainder of the day,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Labor, Management Conflict Was Ready To Explode</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Labor-management tensions that erupted into a strike Saturday have been building inexorably for years at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, and both sides are dug in for what could be a fight to the end _ not just to their conflict, but to the 60-year-old airline itself. `` It's a tremendously unfortunate set of circumstances that has been developing for a while,'' said an emotional <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON>, an Eastern company spokesman and lobbyist for 22 years. `` At some point, we had to come to this.'' Management says the company, losing more than $ 1 million a day, just ca n't make it with its high-priced, demanding labor unions. The workers deny that they're overpaid and say management is tearing the company apart anyway, so they might as well stand and fight. `` Our people have been frustrated, they've been provoked, they've been brutalized They're ready for something forceful to show their feelings,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union District 100 president who joined the company as a mechanic in 1956, said before what he predicted would be `` a wingding of a strike.'' After a 17-month contract dispute, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s largest union walked out at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday and was quickly joined by pilots and flight attendants. With the carrier virtually shut down, company officials admitted they were surprised by the solidarity of the pilots with the Machinists. `` I think this has been building and everybody understands the company wants to divide the pilots and the -LRB- Machinists -RRB-,'' Eastern pilots union spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. `` It's not a Machinists issue. It's a <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> issue.'' Bankrupting the airline `` is a very real possibility,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. `` But that's where the airline is headed anyway, so we can face the music now when we have some leverage, or we can face the music later when there's nothing left.'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chairman who bought Eastern three years ago, has solidified his anti-union reputation at a carrier that already had some of the airline industry's most recalcitrant unions. His new management in 1987 demanded 30 percent wage concessions it said was necessary to keep <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, bought on the brink of bankruptcy with nearly $ 2.5 billion in debts, alive. The balking unions were hit with thousands of layoffs, firings and suspensions. A flight attendant was fired after allegedly pocketing $ 2 in drink money, her union said, and another was disciplined for repeated absences after she was raped. Machinists' horror stories included a firing for refusing to work overtime on Christmas, while the pilots said their ranks shrank by more than 1,000 because of stress and forced overflying. The management said it was time for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers to face reality _ they were being paid too much and were used to lax rules that were puttin Eastern out of business. The company, led for more than two decades by World War I flying ace <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rickenbacker </PERSON> and then for a decade by Apollo 8 astronaut <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Borman </PERSON>, was slow to react to the jet age and slower still to adjust to airline deregulation. <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> tried a number of innovative programs and at times seemed a model of enlightened management in his dealings with Eastern unions. But, labor leaders said, he could n't keep his promises and workers decided that wage givebacks they made in return for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> stock and profits were going down the drain. `` Eastern has been a cash-flow generator for its lenders for years, and has never been designed to make a profit,'' said Cole, an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilot for 19 years and the son of a pilot who flew with the airline for 38 years. <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said the company in happier times was excessively generous to unions that only became more militant. A major turning point came with the 1980 election of <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> to head the Machinists, he said. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, depicted by management as an ego-driven man with a near-mad vision of running the airline himself, believes giving employees company decision-making power improves productivity and service. He also says the workers have more pride in Eastern than management does. He has tried to organize an employee takeover of the company or attract `` white knights'' to buy out <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. He and the other unions have fought <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> at every turn, with myriad lawsuits, grievances and lobbying in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said recently, the actions turned out to be only a delay of the inevitable showdown as, he claimed, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> tried to break the unions while `` cannibalizing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and leaving only a shell.'' <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> made <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s computer reservations system a subsidiary, reaped hundreds of millions of dollars in management fees and loans from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, and sold its profitable northeast Shuttle service to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, a sale that is awaiting final federal approval. While <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> was able to elicit some concessions, the unions looked at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s record and refused to give in to <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. He beat a strike at tiny <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> International two decades ago and then ended a labor rebellion after his bitter takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> by sending the carrier into bankruptcy reorganization in 1983. Labor contracts were abrogated. `` No one believes <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> will stop trying to ruin the unions if we do n't fight,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, flight attendants union president. `` At <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, they have continued to ask employees to make concessions to fund mismanagement. It worked once, it worked twice, it ca n't continue to work any longer.'' `` This is really make it or break it,'' she said.

<HEAD>Transportation Chief Vows Emergency Legislation if Necessary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said Saturday the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would seek emergency legislation, if necessary, to prohibit striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> employees from broadening their protest to `` hold American industry hostage.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, asked about prospective union plans to establish secondary picket lines at other airlines and commuter railroads, declared: `` A secondary boycott will hurt our ability to compete in the world. ... We'll take action if labor shuts down industry in this country. We're not going to tolerate that.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, interviewed on the <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged that a recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision allowed secondary boycotts in the transportation sector, unlike other industries. `` I hope the machinists do n't use this anomaly in the law to shut down American industry and hold American industry hostage,'' he said. `` It's not fair.'' Union officials said Saturday they were examining a number of potential targets, airlines and railroads included, for secondary picketing, probably to begin Monday. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, accused <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of attempting `` to confine this dispute to a narrow arena where -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> can bring all his resources to bear'' against the striking employees. <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON> said: `` We apologize to all of those who may ultimately be affected. We have a wide range of options, and we'll consider those one at a time. <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON> said the prospect of a widespread secondary boycott was `` no greater a threat than somebody daring us to do it, as the administration clearly has.'' He referred to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s refusal a day earlier to establish an emergency fact-finding board and thereby postpone any job actions for 60 days. But <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said: `` This dispute has been going on for 17 months. It's time we get it resolved. There was no guarantee that in 60 days we're going to be any better off than we are now.'' Moreover, said <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, `` We ca n't afford to let a company go bankrupt in the next 60 days. Eastern does n't have enough cash to operate.'' Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, noted that 34 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to establish the emergency board, a procedure that has resolved 26 of 34 previous cases without a work stoppage. `` In this case, he's been wrongly advised,'' said <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said, `` It appears that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has been flying some flights today, and I think that with 2,200 <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- inspectors all over the country, we can make sure that those airplanes to do go up are safe. There's no question that all the pilots and mechanics all have to be <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> licensed.'' Later <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, went by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> command center in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to check on the situation. While there, he telephoned <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> regional headquarters around the nation to give employees a pep talk. As for plans to head off any secondary boycott with special legislation, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said on CNN: `` Why should commuters in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and auto workers in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, be involved in this dispute? They should not.''

 There's only one catch to the free home <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stirling </PERSON> is offering in central <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> _ the new owner has to cart away the 1,100-square-foot house with a two-car garage.

<TEXT>
 Soviet truck convoys carrying emergency food and fuel reached the Afghan capital on Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> said. The relief convoy had been stranded at <LOCATION> Hairatan </LOCATION>, an Afghan village on the border with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, after bad weather closed the 250-mile <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, said the radio monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. It did not say how long the convoy had been stuck or when the snow hit the highway, which is <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s key overland link to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Avalanches periodically shut the highway, which cuts through the Hindu Kush mountains. It was along the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> moved the remainder of its troops out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Feb. 15, after nine years of military intervention. In a bid to preempt Afghan rebel attacks on departing Soviet soldiers, Soviet and Afghan fighter jets bombed both sides of the highway in the last week in January. As many as 600 civilians died in the bombing raids, said a publication distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, which operates extensively along the highway. Afghan Moslem guerrilla fighters, called mujahedeen, have besieged the capital, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and blocked most roads into the city since late last year. The fighters are backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and several <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states. There are serious food and fuel shortages in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, caused as much by an unusually bitter winter as by the rebel siege. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> program to airlift food and fuel from <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> for refugees in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> has been stalled because airlines refused to fly into the city, saying it was not safe. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> reported that Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> promised economic and humanitarian assistance to Afghan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON>, who is visiting the Indian capital for meetings with top officials. On the battlefield, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> reported, government troops in the past 24 hours killed 14 `` criminals,'' a word the state radio uses to describe the guerrillas. Meanwhile, a key rebel commander in the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> area said in a new report that workers last month finished building a helicopter landing pad between President's <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s palace and the ruling party's headquarters. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> said <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> had the heliport built for a speedy escape from the capital should rebels overrun the city. <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> also said explosives have been planted at some military and communications installations in the city to be detonated by remote control by retreating government troops. There was no independent confirmation of <PERSON> Haq </PERSON>'s claims.

 A federal drug agent whose murder touched off a nationwide manhunt was eulogized Saturday as a `` teddy bear of a man'' who fell victim to the violence he sought to prevent. About 4,000 mourners turned out for the funeral of <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Agent <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boonton </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> was unarmed when he was shot to death Tuesday by a man whom officials say has ties to organized crime. Thousands of <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and policemen from as far away as <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> lined up in the parking lot outside <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christopher </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> when the hearse pulled up. The strains of a single bagpipe from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Emerald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> pipe band cut through the chilly air while the flag-draped coffin was carried up the steps. Also present at the heavily guarded, 1 -LCB- - hour service were <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, and Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, R-N.Y. Father <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraioli </PERSON>, the family priest, described <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> as a gentle and kind man who would live on in the memories of those who met him `` He was not a man of violence,'' the priest said. A former <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent and close friend of <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGenaro </PERSON>, recalled the slain agent as a `` teddy bear of a man'' who loved to make people laugh and whom he remembered `` grinning from ear to ear.'' `` He has touched all of us and we are sad he's gone,'' he said. `` But he lives on in our minds and our hearts.'' At the service were the slain agent's wife, <PERSON> Maryjane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, and the couple's two children, <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>, 3, and <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON>, 9. Mrs. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said Friday that people who use drugs must share the blame for her husband's death. `` Even through the grief and our loss, I must ask the question, who really killed <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>?'' she said. `` Who are the ultimate guilty parties who create the market for the poison which he valiantly tried to remove from our society?'' <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> officials said the investigation of <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s killing was continuing `` satisfactorily.'' A van that was driven by the main suspect, <PERSON> Costible </PERSON> <PERSON> Farace </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, was found late Friday in <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Officials believe <PERSON> Farace </PERSON>, a paroled killer, shot <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> four times during a meeting in a secluded area along an expressway on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, who was wearing a radio transmitter, had previously met with <PERSON> Farace </PERSON> several times. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> has undertaken a nationwide search for <PERSON> Farace </PERSON>. He had not been charged with murder, but a warrant was issued for his arrest on narcotics charges. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Farace </PERSON> appeared to have loose ties to the <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> crime family, and was involved in a ring that transported cocaine from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said officials had gotten calls from hundreds of people trying to cooperate with the investigation, but `` as any tedious investigation it will take time to build a case.'' `` We will locate Mr. <PERSON> Farace </PERSON>, you can rest assured of that,'' he said. <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> has ordered <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s 500 <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents to focus on the murder until <PERSON> Farace </PERSON> is found. A nationwide search was underway. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will visit the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this week, a visit expected to boost what he said was low morale in the wake of the murder, <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also planned to meet with <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s family.

<HEAD>Thousands March for Peace In El Salvador</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 10,000 people carrying palm leaves, white flags and peace banners marched Saturday to demand postponement of the presidential election and a negotiated end to the civil war. Leftist rebels accused the government of bad faith in the effort to schedule talks aimed at achieving peace. They said they are being `` pushed to continue and escalate the war.'' The march through downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> was sponsored by dozens of religious, political and student organizations. `` Because of this unjust war, we struggle for peace,'' said the marchers. Their column stretched for about two miles along <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> II Avenue running through the center of the city. The <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, in January proposed postponement of the March 19 presidntial election as a first step toward ending the 9-year-old civil war. The rebels, who had rejected all previous elections this decade as a sham, said they would participate in and respect the outcome of the vote if it were postponed until September to give them time to organize. The government of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has suggested holding it April 30. The guerrillas say that is much too soon. The legislature, which is controlled by the rightist opposition and has a virtual veto power over any postponement, insists the election be held as scheduled. The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, in a communique broadcast over clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION>, said Saturday that guerrilla-government talks must be held Tuesday and Wednesday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> if there is to be any prospect of negotiating peace. The government had proposed meeting with the rebels in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> insists any negotiations be `` among and in full view of all Salvadorans.''

<HEAD>Mauritian Leader Reportedly Escapes Second Assassination Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT LOUIS, Mauritius (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Aneerood </PERSON> <PERSON> Jugnauth </PERSON> has escaped the second assassination attempt in four months, local newspapers reported Saturday. Police said they arrested a man who tried to attack <PERSON> Jugnauth </PERSON> with a razor Friday night. But they refused to release any details about the attack or the assailant. Authorities said this Indian Ocan island, which boasts one of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s few multiparty democracies, was calm. During a Nov. 6 religious ceremony, a Hindu priest attempted to shoot <PERSON> Jugnauth </PERSON> with a pistol. The priest was disarmed and the prime minister, who also is a Hindu like most Mauritians, was not injured. Motives for the attack, on which the priest faces charges of attempted murder, remain unclear. <PERSON> Jugnauth </PERSON> came to power in 1982 parliamentary elections and faces a militant opposition. But he has presided over an economic boom that has virtually wiped out unemployment in this sugar-producing island with its growing tourist industry. Most of <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>' 1 million islanders are Indian-descended Hindus.

 It will be four years on March 11 that <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, instituting a policy of restructuring the Soviet system and bringing about a greater openness of that closed society.

 Jetliners daily carry Soviets to visit relatives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and roam the shops. In Central <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, resident <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors verify the scrapping of Soviet missiles. New Yorkers along Broadway cheer the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader. In four years, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` new thinking'' has brought style and substance to Soviet foreign policy, largely to plaudits from the West. Once the domain of frowning apparatchiks with a penchant for saying `` nyet,'' <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> diplomacy now proclaims its willingness to consider any complaint, and to compromise. While still beset at home by a stagnant economy, ethnic unrest and a growing impatience for more food and a better life, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> can cite a string of impressive achievements in world affairs since he was named <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief March 11, 1985: _ A U.S.-Soviet treaty signed in December 1987 banning medium-range and shorter-range nuclear missiles It was the first negotiated reduction in superpower nuclear forces. _ An end to the nine-year military intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> that soured East-West relations and left up to 13,000 Red Army soldiers dead _ Five superpower summits, plus good prospects for a meeting soon with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ The narrowing of differences with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and agreement to hold the first Chinese-Soviet summit in 30 years in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in May When Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> first met <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in December 1984, she judged: `` We can do business together.'' Her verdict sums up the West's attitude toward the energetic, pragmatic communist who succeeded <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON>. In a recent public opinion poll in the conservative bastion of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the Soviet leader scored a higher favorable rating than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ 70 percent to 67 percent. When <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, got out of their limousine near a Broadway theater during a December visit to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Americans cheered from the sidewalks. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, 58, says his brand of diplomacy forms a seamless web with `` perestroika,'' his drive for economic and social reform at home. `` We say honestly, for all to hear, that we need a lasting peace to concentrate on the development of our society and tackle the tasks of improving the life of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people,'' he said in 1987. In other words, reduced world tensions mean the need for fewer guns, and that means more bread and apartments for Soviet people. A cut of 500,000 men and 10,000 tanks in the country's armed forces, announced by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in December, appears motivated as much by Soviet economic pressures as by a desire to ease East-West confrontation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Conversely, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s domestic reforms have led to improved relations abroad and often appear motivated to dispel what he refers to as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s `` enemy image.'' Some examples: the 1987 release of Nobel Peace Prize laureate <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> from internal exile, the freeing of more than 300 imprisoned political and religious activists, and a marked increase in the number of Soviets permitted to emigrate and visit relatives abroad. More than 35,000 visas were granted last year for Soviets to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, twice the 1987 figure. The new face of Soviet foreign policy was personified by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s appointment of <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to replace <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> as foreign minister. The dour <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, nicknamed `` Mr. Nyet'' by those he faced across the negotiating table for nearly three decades, was elevated to a ceremonial post less than four months after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power to make room for the debonaire <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, who pointedly has criticized the way the Soviets used to deal with the outside world. In July, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> announced that the `` class-struggle'' basis of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> diplomacy, under which the Kremlin for decades labored for the triumph of socialist revolution abroad, has given way to `` universal human values'' such as the banning of nuclear weapons and renunciation of military force in favor of negotiation to settle international disputes. Such a switch in emphasis implies a cutback in Soviet commitments to client states, including <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. The passage to socialism by such countries was trumpeted as a major <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> foreign policy success in the 1970s, but their unproductive economies cost the Soviets dearly in economic and military aid. In April, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is to travel to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, where he is expected to outline new limits on the Soviets' largess to bolster the island's economy and to signal to its neighbors that the Kremlin no longer will bankroll socialist revolutions in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also has indicated that economics played a role in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s decision to end the Afghan intervention, which one Estonian newspaper estimates cost the Soviets $ 100 billion. However, the `` new way of thinking'' in some respects may be only a `` new way of talking'' on some issues the new leadership has yet to address. Despite <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s repeated calls for construction of a `` common European home,'' for instance, the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall still divides the German city and, symbolically, the continent into communist and non-communist camps. The Kremlin is seeking to become a major player in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, a role that is impossible without better relations with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But the Soviets so far have failed to satisfy <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s condition for improving ties: renegotiation of the status of the <LOCATION> Kuril </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, which the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> occupied at the end of World War II. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has acknowledged that putting his `` new thinking'' into action is a long-term effort, but he takes visible pride in his successes to date. `` We believe that the situation has changed for the better, that a window of hope has opened up a little,'' he said last year.

 <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Palacias </PERSON> did n't have to walk the Machinists picket lines that went up Saturday outside <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. He no longer works there. `` But I felt I could n't turn my back,'' said <PERSON> Palacias </PERSON>, 62, who retired in December 1987 after 22 years as a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union aircraft mechanic. `` This is a showdown. I truly believe we have right on our side. It may just be a showdown to the death.'' Faced with a foe already accused of breaking one unionized airline, many in the 8,500-member <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union vow never to swap their red strike shirts for white surrender flags in the fight over wages and work conditions. Their fervor is not directed at the company, where many union members have worked since the last strike in 1966, but on its boss, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, who acquired Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. Three years earlier, he forced <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy reorganization in 1983 to end a labor confrontation and abrogate collective bargaining pacts. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMaria </PERSON>, chief steward of the Machinists local in <LOCATION> Bayonne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said while walking the picket line Saturday: `` The labor of this country is aware of what a terrorist <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is. They consider the dispute not only against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> but a dispute for all labor.'' `` It's a war,'' said <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> baggage handler <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>. `` There are a lot of people here ready to pay any sacrifice to win this one.'' Yet many fear the price may be high as the strike could drive under the 60-year-old company with <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> attempting the same union-busting strategy used at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. `` We said we would n't worry until the strike came,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditzler </PERSON>, whose husband has worked as an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> stock clerk for 20 years. `` It's time to worry.'' <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Haber </PERSON>, general chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> local, said workers will receive a paycheck Friday then wait two weeks for $ 100-a-week strike payments. Haber, however, said a decision by pilots and <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> to honor picket lines could force a quick resolution, possibly by White House intervention. `` I predict a 10-day strike with the pilots on our side,'' said <PERSON> Haber </PERSON>, who fought <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management during strikes of six weeks in 1958 and seven weeks in 1966. `` I hope we wo n't kill the airline, but <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> was trying to kill us,'' said <PERSON> Haber </PERSON>. Eastern management, which claimed the airline has been losing $ 1 million a day due to high labor costs, was demanding nearly $ 150 million in Machinists concessions. The union rejected the demand. `` The emotions usually die down after the first week,'' said <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> McGarry </PERSON>, the union's strike coordinator. `` Then we are faced with the issues of trying to make ends meet at home.'' The possible loss of paychecks holds different significance for the union workers, who include mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground-service workers. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, 26, who started as an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> mechanic three years ago, said he'd move on to another job if Eastern fails. `` We'll take the company down if we have to,'' said <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>. `` It's come down to that.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s reputation as one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s toughest bosses is being tested with the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike, but so is his image as a successful airline builder Since Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and its chairman took over <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> when it was on the brink of bankruptcy three years ago, the view of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> as the model for taking advantage of airline deregulation has been shaken. For all its cost-cutting, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> has been posting record losses. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> warned <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s workers last week that their company ca n't survive a strike by Machinists with the pilots and flight attendants joining in. The unions are gambling that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> ca n't survive, either, and that <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> will either yield or sell <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to protect his parent corporation They concede the possibility, though, that he may finish stripping away <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets and leave a shell, or take the company into bankruptcy. The workers' willingness to fight Lorenzo even at risk to their future underlines his unpopular management style. Although he bought Eastern in February 1986 with the slogan `` we are n't union-busters; we're airline-builders,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> added: `` There ai n't no <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>.'' The man recently called one of the nation's `` toughest bosses'' and a corporate `` loose cannon'' rolling on deck by `` Fortune'' magazine was born <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> 48 years ago to <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> immigrants in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, three miles from <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. At one point young <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> drove a truck and belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, whose schoolboy nickname of `` Frankie Smooth Talk'' was unearthed by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> labor leaders who also sport `` Stop Lorenzo'' buttons, graduated from <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, worked at <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and Eastern, then in 1971 helped buy money-losing <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which became <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> in 1980. With an inner circle of ambitious, hard-driving executives well-versed in the ways of Wall Street and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has built Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> with a takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and its swallowing of such carriers as <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and other small carriers. Continental has been predominantly nonunion since he got labor contracts abrogated in 1983 bankruptcy reorganization. He had mounted unsuccessful efforts to take over <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> when <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 1986 financial and labor crisis gave him an opening to buy the major carrier. He gave <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s board a take-it-or-leave-it offer which it accepted after the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union refused to make major wage concessions. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> at first would n't deal directly with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> union leaders, but late last year had dinner with combative <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union head <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>. The meeting led only to more disputes. He made direct appeals to pilots and flight attendants in a homey videotape sent to their homes last week. A nonsmoker, ardent jogger and married father of three daughters and a son, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s description of himself as a honest, hard-working family man does n't persuade <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers who call him a corporate terrorist they are determined to fight.

<TEXT>
 Buried deep beneath the village of <PERSON> Sharapova </PERSON> southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> are bunkers designed to allow <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leaders to survive a nuclear war. Contrast those shelters with statements by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that a nuclear war can not be won and should never be fought and you face the imponderable dilemma of the nuclear age: Why do the superpowers have atomic weapons and how will they use them? In the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> and at the White House, the superpowers are reviewing their own nuclear doctrines. National security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> is directing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort, one that is expected to change the defense budget, the shape of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear arsenal and American positions in arms control talks. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet theories on the use of atomic weapons have evolved over the decades, from the construction of the first bombs in the 1940s until the widespread acceptance now that nuclear weapons are too dangerous to use in war. `` We are profoundly devoted to the idea of a nuclear-free world,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wrote in `` Perestroika.'' `` If the huge stockpiles of nuclear, chemical and other weapons that have been accumulated are unleashed, nothing will remain of the world. What we are talking about is the survival of humanity.'' Such statements are welcomed in the West. But scrape away the rhetoric, and some disturbing facts remain. Since 1980, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has modernized its arsenal by adding land-based missiles with about 1,000 warheads, including two new mobile classes, the SS-24 and SS-25, which are not matched by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 12,683 boms and warheads, compared with 10,358 for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbying organization. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet arsenals are designed largely for use against the other superpower. And although they have never used them against each other, the threat is always there, summed up in the by-word of the nuclear age: deterrence. Deterrence, according to the Americans, equals MAD _ Mutual Assured Destruction. Over the years the Soviets have taken a somewhat different view. As early as 1977, the-Soviet President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> enunciated the `` <LOCATION> Tula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Doctrine </LOCATION>,'' which states that a nuclear can never be won and should never be fought. That doctrine has been adopted by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. But many <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officers, writing in theoretical journals and training manuals, argued otherwise, leading many Western analysts to conclude that Soviet war plans included a possible `` first strike'' against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And many believed at the time that the Soviets might use tactical nuclear weapons to try for an early victory during a war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a view that was buttressed by the deployment of medium-range Soviet SS-20s in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the late 1970s. The SS-20s are being destroyed under the <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate-Range </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> treaty, signed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in December 1987. The SS-20 deployment, which was criticized by <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> journalists like <PERSON> Aleksandr </PERSON> <PERSON> Bovin </PERSON> and reformist scholars in civilian think-tanks, was part of a massive military build-up under <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, giving the Soviets parity with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in nuclear weapons, and near parity or superiority in conventional and naval forces. The Soviets now say they have adopted the `` new thinking'' of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and want to eliminate nuclear weapons by the end of the century. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the Soviets have made no move to dismantle their long-range nuclear forces or the bunkers where Kremlin leaders could hide in the event of war. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in its annual report, `` The Soviet Threat,'' that the first bunkers were built 40 years ago, and that `` yet another round of construction on these complexes began in the early 1980s, when Soviet leaders were publicly emphasizing that a nuclear war would be so catastrophic that attempts to achieve victory or even seriously limit damage in such a war no longer made sense.'' `` The bunkers are a manifestation of the old thinking,'' said one of the think-tank scholars who is backing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign to trim the military. He asked that his name not be used because the bunkers are considered a state-secret. Yet, many American critics of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> are persuaded that the `` new thinking'' has taken hold in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbrunner </PERSON>, director of foreign policy studies at the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the bunkers are not evidence of a duplicitous Soviet nuclear doctrine. Rather, he said, they are similar in concept to the airplanes that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> keeps at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, waiting to whisk top leaders out of danger in the event of war. `` There are very good reasons to have those bunkers in order to stabilize your command,'' said <PERSON> Steinbrunner </PERSON>. `` If your central command can be eliminated by pre-emptive attack, you can be knocked out.'' In addition to its plan to keep the president airborne during the initial stages of a nuclear attack, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military also maintains secure underground facilities in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and other states, largely as communications installations. The distinction is that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> system of underground facilities is not as extensive as that of the Soviets in terms of the number of officials they would house or the length of time they might remain in them. Soviet leaders have claimed that they developed nuclear weapons in response to such bombs in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arsenal. But the memoirs of Soviet physicists, published in the 1980s, give evidence that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> secretly sought to be the first to develop the bomb. Soviet work on the bomb began in the late 1930s. Through spies, the Soviet leadership learned in 1943 of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, and ordered physicists to speed up their work. After the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dropped an A-bomb on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> in 1945, the Soviets redoubled their efforts. `` Provide us with nuclear weapons in the shortest possible time. You know that <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> has shaken the whole world. The balance has been destroyed. Provide the bomb _ it will remove a great danger from us,'' <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> told the physicists. Four years later, the Soviets tested their first bomb, according to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, a scholar at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and author of the book `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the Arms Race.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, nevertheless, retained a significant edge in the number of weapons and means to deliver them. Unable to afford the cost of maintaining a full land army in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> adopted the less expensive alternative of balancing Soviet military might with nuclear weapons. That remains the fundamental principle of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear doctrine in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Although the Red army occupied most of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after the defeat of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the American A-Bomb denied them superiority on the continent. During the Cold War, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet politicians and physicists engaged in a game of geo-political chess, maneuvering to place each other's cities, military bases and allies at nuclear risk. Through the'50s and'60s, the Soviets struggled to keep pace with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear arsenal, but were hamered because unlike the Americans, they did not have bases near their adversary on which to base bombers and missiles. The launching of the first man-made satellite, the Soviet sputnik in October 1957, signaled that the Russians had the means to build intercontinental ballistic missiles, and helped prompt <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to warn of a `` missile gap'' during his successful presidential campaign in 1960. In 1962, <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> tried to put Soviet missiles within striking distance of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by deploying them in communist <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The Soviet failure in the missile crisis spurred them to achieve strategic parity with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>PLO Official Quoted as Saying US Dialogue Should be Upgraded</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Stands for Jerusalem-dated story on news advisory.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A newspaper Saturday quoted a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman as saying informal talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are `` beating around the bush'' and that `` serious'' dialogue focusing on an international peace conference should begin. The comments by <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Abd-Rabboo </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s information department chief, were reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. <PERSON> Abd-Rabboo </PERSON> was quoted as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> `` notified <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> a week ago that it was time to resume a serious and in depth dialogue to prepare for an international conference.'' `` Dragging on with informal contacts that have been taking place in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> is beating round the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> and will not help bring about a settlement,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying. <PERSON> Abd-Rabboo </PERSON> could not be reached directly for comment, according to an aide in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, who demanded anonymity. There was no immediate reaction from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. It did not return telephone calls from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper article was picked up by <PERSON> Radio </PERSON> <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON>, whose report was then repeated on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s state-run radio and television Saturday. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media reported that <PERSON> Abd-Rabboo </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was not willing to continue the dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> under current conditions. But such comments did not appear in the <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION> report seen in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION> also quoted <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sourani </PERSON>, a member of the 15-man <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, as saying `` the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> expects the dialogue to resume and take its natural course in March or April, after the crystalization of the American attitude on Palestinian rights.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> launched a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> late last year, ending a 13-year boycott of such talks after <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism and recognized the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which considers the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a terrorist organization, repeatedly has urged <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to end the talks, citing what it calls continuing <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> attacks. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> warned Friday that recent clashes between <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> could have a negative impact on the dialogue. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> were trying to infiltrate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Palestinian leaders say military operations against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were not included in <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s commitment renouncing terrorism. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said Friday that <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas will continue to strike back during <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> raids on their bases in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s closest aide, <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahlaf </PERSON>, was quoted as saying Saturday that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is `` still hesitant'' about its dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and that was the reason for its warning. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlo </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, also quoted him as saying, `` Military operations are not acts of terrorism.'' `` Our definition of terrorism is very clear. Any operation abroad -LRB- outside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> -RRB- in which civilians, including Israelis, are killed, is terrorism,'' said <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, co-founder of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction. The radio did not say where he was interviewed.

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Throngs crowding a downtown street covered with trucked-in snow cheered Saturday as 49 mushers and hundreds of dogs charged off on the first leg of the 1,168-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race from <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>. The 17th annual race over the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Range </LOCATION>, across desolate stretches and along the storm-raked coast began in clear, windy weather at 9 a.m., with veteran musher <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> first out of the chute. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>, aiming for her fourth consecutive win and the $ 50,000 winner's share of the $ 250,000 purse, was 19th to leave in the succession of departures spaced two minutes apart. Rival <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> of Two Rivers, the only person to win the race four times, was No. 22. `` I feel great! I feel great!'' Butcher, 33, of <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> said with a laugh as she hugged a well-wisher before the start of her 12th Iditarod. Last year, she finished in just under 11 days and 12 hours. `` I think that I can take the pressure,'' she said. `` I know that everybody's gunning for me, I know that everybody's after me, but I do n't see how they can be more after me than they were last year.'' A temperature of 13 degrees and winds gusting to 46 mph combined for a wind chill of minus 22 degrees at the race's start. Stronger wind and clear skies were reported along the first stretch of the race route. The snow was trucked in because the streets had been swept. Some observers crowded into a fast-food restaurant to stay warm while awaiting the start. Children outside hawked Iditarod newspapers and a man wearing a sandwich sign advertised Iditarod photographs. The race, inspired by a sled-dog relay of serum to <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> for a diptheria outbreak in 1925, began in 1973. The number of competitors dropped this year in part because the record cold spell of January and February prevented mushers from giving their dogs enough training, said race manager <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Niggemyer </PERSON>. There were 53 competitors last year. The racers will stop at 25 checkpoints along the route, where they will get food for themselves and their dogs. Along the way, they will camp out or stay in homes or lodges. Commercial subsidies for the race have grown substantially over the years, with money coming from a variety of sources, including television rights, dog-food companies and manufacturers of cold-weather gear. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Redington </PERSON>, the 72-year-old `` Father of the Iditarod,'' stood by his dogs early Saturday as he waited to compete for the 15th time. `` I'm a little more serious this year than I have been before,'' said <PERSON> Redington </PERSON>, who has never won the race. `` I usually go out and have a good time. I'll be a little more serious now.'' <PERSON> Libby </PERSON> <PERSON> Riddles </PERSON>, whose 1985 victory made her the first woman to win the Iditarod, is back after missing two of the last three races and dropping out of a third. `` I'm just real anxious to get on the trail,'' said Riddles, 32, of <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>. `` I feel prepared for anything.''

<HEAD>Grapes of Wrath: Vineyard Destruction Makes Soviets Whine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Excessive zeal in pursuing President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s anti-drinking drive caused the destruction of 16 percent of Soviet vineyards, many of which were n't intended to produce wine, a newspaper said Saturday. The labor daily <ORGANIZATION> Trud </ORGANIZATION> said table grapes rather than wine grapes suffered the most during the systematic uprooting of vines spurred by the interest in promoting Soviet sobriety. In 1985-87, 533,000 acres of Soviet vineyards, or 16 percent of the total, were destroyed, Trud said. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency called it a `` human folly.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> launched the anti-alcohol campaign in May 1985, raising the price of vodka and other alcoholic beverages and cutting production within two months of being named <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief. Since then, the Soviets have admitted they erred in treating all alcoholic beverages alike, and have liberalized the sales of wine, cognac and some other beverages. <PERSON> Trud </PERSON> said the 1985-87 drive to uproot vineyards had especially hit the southern republic of <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>, one of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s most celebrated wine-growing regions, the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, the Russian federation and the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> To compound the damage, vines killed in severe winters during those years were not replaced, and the establishment of new vineyards was halved, <PERSON> Trud </PERSON> said.

 Tow trucks hauled away the charred husks of buses Saturday, and a shortage of coffins was reported following nationwide riots that killed at least 300 people and left thousands injured. Hospitals were crammed with victims of the four days of disturbances _ the bloodiest in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s history. The riots were touched off Monday by bus fare increases and evolved into nationwide demonstrations against a government austerity program. Authorities loosened a curfew in the capital and reduced the number of national guard units on the streets. Tow trucks cleared burned buses from intersections. Long lines of people stood outside distribution centers and the few food stores open for business. Residents near <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>' central morgue said the smell of about 250 dead bodies was leading to fears of disease. News reports said some coffins were arriving with two bodies inside because there were n't enough caskets to go around. The director of the largest hospital in the city said morgue officials called on medical officials to help them with the bodies. The hospital director, Dr. <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirinos </PERSON>, said 1,881 injured people crowded her 700-bed Hospital <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Carreno </PERSON>. She said most of the injured were young men with bullet wounds. `` We've been doing very well under the circumstances,'' she said. President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said at least 300 people were killed and 2,000 injured in the riots and looting. News reports have said several thousand people were detained. Insurance companies estimated damage to their clients was about $ 76 million but that many looted businesses had no coverage, according to news reports. Authorities pushed back a 6 p.m. curfew to 8 p.m. Friday in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> and suspended it altogether in several regions of the country. The military had airlifted 50 tons of food into <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> in the last three days, news reports said. Soldiers guarded vital roads, gasoline stations, food distribution centers and government buildings, but there were fewer armored personnel carriers and tanks in the streets. However, many <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> residents still were not convinced the violence was over. `` I do n't know where this is going to end, but I'm sick of it,'' said <PERSON> Marisabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, standing in the doorway of a housing project. Oil-producing <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> was for decades one of the wealthiest and politically stable nations in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But a fall in world oil prices, combined with debt payments, has depleted monetary reserves, creating the economic crisis. Real wages have fallen by a third since 1981, and inflation is expected to double this year to 70 percent. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> could expect six months of economic hardship. In a letter Saturday to <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said his country would continue to follow an IMF-mandated austerity program, but complained the fund did not take into account local economic conditions and low world prices for Third World exports. The austerity measures are required under an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for a $ 4.3 billion loan over the next three years. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s letter thanked <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> for his personal statements of support for <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> following recent violence. But he complained that the IMF-approved reforms were like trying `` to give medicine to a patient without taking into account his organic conditions.'' He said the reforms `` gravely affect the impoverished sectors of the country that explode in desperation in the horrifying violence that we saw unleashed on the streets of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>.''

<UNK>Fire Sweeps Into National Park And Threatens Indian Reserve ^By TODD

<TEXT>
 More than 150 firefighters and volunteers Saturday battled a forest fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pascoal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, the last great wildlife reserve of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coastal forest and home to about 1,000 Indians. Firefighters have been unable to contain the blaze, which entered the park Friday, fire chief <PERSON> Solange </PERSON> <PERSON> Borges </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Borges </PERSON> said the fire had already destroyed more than 62 acres of the park, which is 900 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. He spoke by telephone from the city of <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, 1,055 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. The park is the last untouched sanctuary for rare wildlife and vegetation on the Brazilian coast and is home to 1,000 Pataxo indians who live on a reserve in it. `` The situation gets more critical by the minute,'' said <PERSON> Borges </PERSON>. `` We're on the brink of a real emergency.'' The fire began 28 days ago as a series of brush fires throughout the northeastern state of <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION>. It has destroyed more than half <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, sweeping south through more than 80,000 acres of virgin wilderness. The cause of the fire was not known. But <PERSON> Borges </PERSON> said Indians often set fire to their land at the edge of the forest this time of year to renew pastures. `` Our biggest worry is that the fire will grow so strong that it takes over the reserve,'' <PERSON> Borges </PERSON> said. `` The fire is a lot stronger than it was a week ago.'' Civil defense workers and local residents battled the fire Friday with helicopters, tractors and sprinkler systems, <PERSON> Borges </PERSON> said. But their efforts have been hampered by dry weather. In addition, the Indians resisted the intrusion of firefighters on their land. `` We're trying to isolate the fires, which are buring in four different areas of the forest right now,'' said <PERSON> Borges </PERSON>. `` But under these circumstances, it has n't been easy.'' Just 3 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, which once covered about 170,000 square miles along a 3,000-mile coastal strip, remains standing today. Some of the forest's rare monkeys, birds and trees, many found nowhere else in the world, face extinction. One of the trees near extinction is the Pau-Brasil, which gave the country its name.

 Five nuns entered their sixth month barricaded in their monastery infirmary despite a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> opinion that calls for an end to the protest and evicts two women from the religious order. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> told two of the women whose vows expired during the protest that they they must leave and are no longer considered members of the Order of Discalced Carmelites, the <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diocese </LOCATION> announced Friday. Two others were told they should seek a different convent. A fifth, a 71-year-old nun who suffers heart problems, would be allowed to stay in the Monastery of the <ORGANIZATION> Most </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blessed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carmel </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, a spokesman for Bishop <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodimer </PERSON>. The nuns said through a spokeswoman that the letters are a last-ditch effort by the bishop to get them to leave. `` Nothing came here with a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> seal on it,'' said the spokeswoman, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>. `` It's the bishop's final trick to get them out.'' Five of the 13 nuns at the monastery locked themselves in the infirmary Oct. 4. They said they feared their pending eviction for protesting liberalizations such as television and candy, which were initiated by the new mother superior, Prioress Mother <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> has called the lock-in a `` scandal'' and criticized the rebel nuns for disrupting the cloistered lifestyle at the convent. Perhaps the nuns' most unwanted notoriety came last week on an episode of `` Hooperman,'' which featured its star, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, falling in love with a nun _ one of five on the program barricaded in their monastery's infirmary, protesting liberalizations at the convent. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellard </PERSON>, executive producer for the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> series, said staff from the show saw news reports about the standoff and thought it would be a good way to have <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, who plays <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> detective <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooperman </PERSON>, fall in love with a nun. `` Basically the episode is about him being very attracted to someone he ca n't have,'' <PERSON> Kellard </PERSON> said. The Rev. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said it could take two weeks or more before an appeal is heard by the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION>'s highest court, the Apostolica Signitura. Mrs. <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said the nuns were surprised the controversy has continued into its sixth month, but said they feel that indicated the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> is taking the case seriously.

 An employee at a safe company uncovered a 40-page secret weapons report from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> after he drilled open a discarded safe. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said he found the government report lodged between two shelves of a safe he drilled open Friday. The safe was in a lot of five safes bought from a <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> surplus outlet, company owner <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. The cover of the document is dated May 24, 1988, and says `` Defense Program _ Weapons Activities.'' The words `` Working Papers,'' `` Restricted Data'' and `` Secret'' also were stamped on it. One handwritten word, `` Destroy,'' slants through the title. The report contains references to cruise missiles and bombers and charts of weapon stockpiles. `` You'd have to be an expert in that field to know what it's all about,'' said <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s wife. `` The average layman would n't understand anything in it.

 The leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union faced down <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> and then the airline's board, and his refusal to give in to new owner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> spurred Saturday's strike at Eastern <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, 55, is depicted by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management as a hate-filled, near-maniacal union boss. In a recently published, red-colored booklet called `` Charlie Says ...'', the company warns that he will destroy the airline. <PERSON> Borman </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> chairman and Apollo 8 astronaut who admits he was driven to tears by <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, recently compared him to <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> cult leader <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who led a mass suicide in 1978. But <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>'s union members trust him and follow him implicitly. Many other Eastern employees have come to admire his persistent, often-innovative strategies, which <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> credits to an extensive self-education that included study of the Bible, Zen, yoga, the ancient Chinese handbook `` The Art of War,'' and the philosophies of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> says he has learned from studying their philosophies that resistance based on inner good and following the right way will triumph His critics say <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>'s philosophy is based on egotism and stubbornness _ or worse. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> has charged repeatedly that the <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> management wants only to bust the unions and strip away <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s assets before abandoning the carcass. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrieri </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a veteran <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> labor lawyer who represents the Machinists, says <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> never ceases to impress him with his drive and creativity. The divorced father of three grown children appears to have unlimited stamina and is equally comfortable in corporate boardrooms, courtrooms, running news conferences or leading fiery union rallies. <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> says <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> has `` a certifiably insane dream'' of running Eastern himself. `` Deregulation's full impact on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s fortunes and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>'s rise to power as a union leader arrived on the scene virtually in tandem, twin omens of our troubled future,'' <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> wrote in his autobiography, `` Countdown.'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, an Eastern mechanic since 1956 and elected to head its largest union in 1980, has been trying to spur employee control of the company. He says workers would be more productive and provide better service if they had more say in the company, which he says has been pushed into financial desperation by years of poor management. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> threatened a strike in 1983 and <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> gave in with a 32 percent raise for the Machinists. <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> then did n't have enough cash to withstand a strike, and that the pay demands were irresponsible because <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> knew <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> could n't afford them In 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s board demanded 20 percent wage concessions from its unions, saying the company would go into bankruptcy without them. The pilots and flight attendants agreed; <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said no concessions unless <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> was fired. The board said it could n't allow such a demand and voted to sell to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> sent <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> a conciliatory telegram. He got no answer and instead was stripped of his seat on the board and of other privileges. That began a struggle <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> describes as between workers whose home has been invaded by a hostile force, even a battle between good and evil.

<TEXT>
 The government assured novelist <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> of its unwavering support Saturday, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> suggested <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> could defuse the crisis over <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s new novel by banning the book and prosecuting the writer. The Indian-born author questioned government support for him Friday after Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s `` The Satanic Verses'' has offended some Britons as well as Moslems. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> welcomed their statements Saturday but demanded <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> take `` concrete action.'' `` The <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government, by accepting that the book is insulting, can not object to the death sentence on the writer, which has been issued in line with <LOCATION> Sharia </LOCATION> -LRB- Islamic law -RRB-,'' it said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament speaker, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, considered leader of the pragmatist camp within the Iranian hierarchy, said the rift over the book `` seems difficult to heal.'' `` Even if the apostate <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> is executed, if <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> apologizes or if the book is withdrawn, the rift remains part of a global arrogance plot,'' the radio quoted <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as saying. He offered no suggestions as to how the controversy could be resolved. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> repeatedly has demanded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, rescind his Feb. 14 death sentence on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> for writing the novel, which some say insults Islam. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> reiterated Saturday that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will not discuss the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> until the death threat is withdrawn. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, 41, who was born into a Moslem family in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, is in hiding. On Friday he telephoned the office of <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashdown </PERSON>, leader of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and said he was worried about the commitment of the government's support for him. Asked to comment Saturday on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s misgivings, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said: `` I want to say that the government has not changed its position at all on this.'' The Sunday Times reported that some British artists had `` succumbed to the climate of fear caused by widening Moslem intimidation.'' It said an unnamed <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> broadcaster, acting on police advice, withdrew an article on the controversy from The Sunday Times. It also said a painting featuring <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> in a critical light which has been on display throughout <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has been dropped from a forthcoming exhibit at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Covent Garden. The weekly Observer reported that at the British Library, `` The Satanic Verses'' is locked on a shelf reserved for rare books and pornography, and can only be read in a high-security reading room. Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, who joined Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> at a <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, was asked about reports that <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> fears for his continued police protection. `` The protection is afforded to him by the police _ not because he requests it, not at my direction, but because it's their professional assessment that he needs that protection,'' he said. <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said he understood `` the hurt and insult being felt'' by Moslems over the book, but `` the overwhelming majority'' of Britons accept <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s right to free expression. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Radio called on the British government to clarify `` whether or not freedom of expression and writing can be a license for defamation and insult. `` If the British government does not see the freedom of expression as a license for defamation, then legal prosecution of the author, prevention of further publication of the book, and removing already published copies are reasonable requests which can remove much of the friction,'' the state radio said in a commentary. The official <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> newspaper on Saturday condemned `` whatever is irreverent and blasphemous'' in <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s `` The Satanic Verses,'' but said its author should not be killed.

<TEXT>
 Physicians treating a snake-venom researcher received a shipment of serum from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to counteract a deadly viper bite Saturday, but a hospital spokesman said doctors may elect not to use it. Antivenin was flown in Saturday afternoon for <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>, 78, who remained in serious but stable condition at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> after being bit on the left hand by a Pakistani pit viper earlier in the week. `` The doctors are evaluating it,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON>, hospital spokesman. `` We're hopeful that it's not needed, but that remains to be seen.'' In an unusual effort initiated by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON>, special assistant to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, antivenins effective against the bite were located in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs rules were waived to place the shipments quickly on flights to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The British shipment from the <ORGANIZATION> English </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> arrived Friday night. But doctors did not administer it to <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>, deciding instead to wait for the more effective Iranian serum, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON> said the shipment from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was being arranged through direct, government-to-government contacts, but in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, `` people-to-people, non-government'' contacts were used. There are no formal ties between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s fundamentalist Moslem government, which has repeatedly referred to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as the `` Great Satan. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>'s fibrinogen level, an element in the blood that regulates how the blood coagulates and is destroyed by the snake bite venom, has been improving, although it remained far below acceptable levels, according to hospital spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON>. `` We have been replacing fibrinogen through transfusions and his body appears to be making fibrinogen,'' <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> said. The Iranian antivenin arrived at mid-afternoon and one of <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>'s friends transported it to the hospital Before it is used, <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> said doctors would monitor <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>'s condition and run checks on the antivenin. `` These antivenins are not miracle cure-alls,'' he said. `` There are negative side effects that we have to guard against.'' He said antivenins, which are made from horse serum, can cause lung and kidney problems. <PERSON> Haast </PERSON> had been treated earlier with antivenins from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> and from a lab in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> said he had not been given antivenins for about 24 hours The supply of the serum from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was being sent from the <ORGANIZATION> Tashkent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vaccines </ORGANIZATION>. That serum was being flown to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and was expected to get to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> late Sunday. <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Serpentarium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> at the university's Research Park, has been bitten 148 times by snakes and is immune to the venom of dozens of reptiles. But he had no immunity to withstand the viper's bite and checked himself into the hospital Wednesday after being bitten Tuesday. The Pakistani pit viper, or saw-scaled viper, is one of 1,000 exotic, poisonous snakes <PERSON> Haast </PERSON> keeps at the lab, where their venom is extracted for sale to universities and health organizations for use in research and the manufacture of antivenins.

<TEXT>
 The recently ousted <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief of the restive <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province was a leader of an outlawed group seeking secession of the region from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, a state-run newspaper alleged Saturday. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Vecernje </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION> claimed <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>, who headed <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s ruling Politburo from 1986-88, was a `` staff officer of a provincial counter-revolutionary group'' working to unite <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> with neighboring <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> was among about 20 leading ethnic Albanian party officials or company directors in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> who have been arrested since Thursday in a crackdown on ethnic Albanian dissent there. Most allegedly belonged to the illegal group that reportedly planned to destabilize the province by strikes and protests and then carry out an armed uprising that would secede the predominantly ethnic Albanian region from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Vecernje </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION> reported what it said were initial results of the police investigation underway after the massive arrests and detentions of prominent <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> public figures. The arrests came after widespread protests by ethnic Albanians in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> against planned constitutional changes they fear will limit autonomy of the region which administratively belongs to the republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. Last Monday, emergency measures were introduced in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> in an attempt to prevent possible clashes between the ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> majority and the Slav minority there. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s ambitious <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> boss, <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, vowed on Tuesday at a counter-demonstration by over 500,000 Serbs in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> that the `` organizers'' of the ethnic Albanian protests would be `` punished and arrested.'' <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>, 41, was the chief opponent of <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s centralist policies and is one of the most popular leaders among about 2 million ethnic Albanians in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. For his consistent opposition to <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s policies toward <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> he was voted out of the country's 165-member policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in February. <ORGANIZATION> Vecernje </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> was arrested while planning to travel to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> along with his wife. His two brothers are reportedly living there. <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> newspapers said Saturday that about 50 prominent public figures, including several provincial party officials, may face criminal prosecution in connection with their alleged role in recent ethnic Albanian unrest. Meanwhile, the official Serbian press is increasingly implying that <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s liberal Slovenian republic was allegedly instigating the ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> unrest in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. It has alleged that <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> secretly visited <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> last month and that he was planning to become the director a Slovenian bank in the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, which itself fears alleged <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> hegemony, has supported ethnic Albanian demands for guarantees that the autonomy of their province will not be curtailed by changes of the constitution.

<HEAD>Disillusioned Communists Quitting Party, Pravda Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Some Communist Party members are resigning because they do n't want to be associated with former leaders <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, Pravda said Saturday in an article urging Communists to face up to their painful past. For decades, the Soviet government hid sordid chapters of its history and even glorified <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> during his lifetime. But under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness, the national press has been full of reports on repression and death under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and corruption under <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. Many older communists have reacted with shock and dismay at the denigration of their heroes. Pravda, the official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, specifically cited electrician <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapayev </PERSON> and <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapodoinikov </PERSON>, a teacher, both from the <LOCATION> Gorno-Altai </LOCATION> region in western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, as members who had dropped out because they were disillusioned. It said others have done the same but gave no figures. `` All my life appears to be worthless,'' <PERSON> Chapayev </PERSON>, who was a party member for 19 years before quitting recently, was quoted as saying. `` All my life I believed, and now all is gone to ashes, and not a blessed thing remains. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, Molotov, <PERSON> Voroshilov </PERSON> ... we were singing songs about them. We believed in them more than we believed in ourselves,'' he said. <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Molotov </PERSON>, foreign minister during the prewar pact with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Kliment </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Voroshilov </PERSON> were two of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s closest aides during the years when the Stalinist secret police killed millions of Soviet citizens Pravda quoted <PERSON> Zapodoinikov </PERSON> as saying, `` I can not remain a member of the party which had <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kunayev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nasriddinova </PERSON> and other scum in its ranks.'' <PERSON> Dinmukhamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunayev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vadgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasriddinova </PERSON> are former regional party officials named in corruption scandals. Pravda correspondent <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomenko </PERSON> said the two disaffected party members from <PERSON> Gorno-Altai </PERSON> were not isolated cases but part of a larger problem dating back years. He said he remembered <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> party members quitting during <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s time, saying: `` It's because we can not live anymore in lies and hypocrisy.'' The newspaper said that although some might argue that the shameful portions of the party's history should be kept quiet, true party members should be able to stand up and face the truth. Admitting the truth, Pravda concluded, is painful but necessary. `` This is a pain similar to that which occurs when light strikes the eyes of a man who has long been in darkness and finally emerges into the sun, or when a doctor restores sight to a blind man, and takes from his eyes the black blindfold. Thus goes the revelation,'' the newspaper said.

On the mainland, strikers paralyzed the carrier, overwhelming management efforts to run a skeleton domestic schedule. Most pilots and flight attendants honored the Machinist union picket lines.

 A passenger train struck the back of another train outside <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Saturday, sending rail cars careening into the yards of nearby homes and killing at least five people, police said. At least 80 people were hurt. Earlier death tolls in the capital's second major rail accident in less than three months ran as high as 12 but could not be confirmed. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard put the confirmed death toll at five dead and 80 injured. Earlier it had said six died. It did not explain the change. <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> reported two deaths there, and <LOCATION> Mayday </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>'s emergency chief, <PERSON> Kambiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON>, said three people were dead at that hospital. Reports of deaths reached 12 earlier in the day when <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> reported four dead at Mayday and six more dead at the scene of the crash _ a claim that could not later be confirmed. There also was apparent confusion over the number of times the two deaths at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helier </ORGANIZATION> had been counted. <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> said his hospital admitted 52 casualties, 20 of them in serious or critical condition. Twenty-four were discharged and three transferred to hospitals specializing in head and spinal injuries. Firefighters had to cut dozens of passengers from the wreckage of the trains, and authorities said some were trapped for hours after the 1:39 p.m. collision near the Purley station in <LOCATION> Surrey </LOCATION>. Both trains originated in southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> cities and were traveling north to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. A British Rail spokesman said it appeared a train that originated in <LOCATION> Horsham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sussex </LOCATION>, was crossing from the local line to a main track when it ran into the back of a train that originated in <LOCATION> Littlehampton </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Littlehampton </LOCATION> is about 50 miles south of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Horsham </LOCATION> is about 30 miles south of the city. The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was not known why both trains were on the northbound track at the same time. The trains collided a few hundred yards outside the station on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s southern outskirts, sending several cars hurtling down an embankment into the yards of homes, witnesses said. It was not known if anyone was hurt in the houses. Several rail cars came to a precarious rest on the steep slope, and residents were advised to leave their homes until the wreckage could be cleared. Witnesses heard a deafening bang followed by silence, then shouts and screams as passersby and residents rushed to the rescue. Firefighters arrived and cut victims from the wreckage. British Rail estimated fewer than 100 people were in the trains _ the normal low volume for a Saturday. A three-train crash at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s busy <ORGANIZATION> Clapham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junction </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 12 killed 35 people, and the latest disaster brought immediate accusations by the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that neglect of the state-owned rail system was to blame. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was `` very distressed'' and following developments, her office said. Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> was said to be shocked. `` I heard a loud bang,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, a nearby resident. `` My son and I brought a sledgehammer and ran over to the train. There was blood everywhere and people screaming.'' Passenger <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said his car `` was tipping down an embankment. I was trapped where I landed and showered with glass.'' He said his train, traveling from English Channel town of <LOCATION> Littlehampton </LOCATION>, was going about 60 mph. <PERSON> Tania </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> and her father were in the other train from <LOCATION> Horsham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, watching a couple across the aisle from them. `` She flew through the air and was knocked unconscious and he was thrown into my lap with blood pouring out of his head. He had glass in his eyes,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. British <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> said engineers began a probe into the cause. <PERSON> Samantha </PERSON> <PERSON> Muggeridge </PERSON>, who was waiting on the Purley platform, said a slow train was headed for the station when `` a faster one came up behind it and seemed to clip the back of it.'' The Dec. 12 crash in <LOCATION> Clapham </LOCATION>, 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Purley </LOCATION>, has been blamed by British Rail on flaws in its system of installing new signaling equipment. Railroad officials believe malfunctioning signals led one commuter train to slam into the rear of another stopped on the tracks. An empty freight train on an adjacent line then plowed into spillover wreckage and apparently hit some passengers who had scrambled onto the tracks. The <PERSON> Clapham </PERSON> crash was the worst rail wreck in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since 1975, when 43 people died in a subway train that crashed in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> tunnel.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> began a three-day fast Saturday to urge Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and mayoral candidate <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> to unite and preserve the coalition formed by former Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> died and our ship wrecked,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a rally at the headquarters of Operation PUSH, the civil rights group he founded. `` Rather than pick up the pieces, we chose to bomb the ship,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Now we must build a new ship in five weeks.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a black Democratic alderman running as an independent, refused to endorse <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> in last Tuesday's Democratic mayoral primary, which was won by <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, who is also black, in the primary and now supports <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> has so far declined to endorse <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> for the general election April 4. `` Division is our problem; unity and coalition are our solution,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` An Evans-Sawyer summit is essential.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the city's first black mayor, died in November 1987. The election this spring is to fill the remaining two years of his second term. After <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s death, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, a former alderman, was selected acting mayor by the City Council. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, who is white, is the son of the late Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, who ruled <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for 21 years. Former <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, who was <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s archrival while a Democrat, won the Republican primary Tuesday. <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> is white. `` There are those who say the only issue in the campaign is race,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` That's not true, but it's a major issue. The issue is not black and white; it's backward and forward.'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> was out of the country and could not be reached for comment, but spokesman <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said he doubted <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s appeal would persuade <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> to endorse <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> `` The mayor has indicated that he's going to remain neutral,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` He just wants to remain above the fray.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Camargo </PERSON> said the alderman was campaigning and could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> defended his support of <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> over <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee, saying that <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> did not support <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in the 1987 election campaign, and that <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> did not support <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s own bid for the presidency. `` I support fairness.

 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> had just watered his chrysanthemums and left his greenhouse Saturday when two passenger trains collided and half a dozen railroad cars hurtled down an embankment behind his home. `` I had only been gone a few minutes when there was an almighty bang. It was like a thunderbolt. I looked at my greenhouse and it was flattened,'' he said. Rail cars had pitched down the steep embankment behind a row of houses and come to rest upside down, one of them in <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s backyard, 30 feet from the house At least five people were killed and scores injured when the two London-bound trains from southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> collided at suburban <LOCATION> Purley </LOCATION>, about 12 miles south of central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The reason for the crash was not immediately known. `` I went into my garage and I got out two sets of ladders and we used them to try and get up to the carriage doors,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` but it was difficult because one of the coaches looked as if we put any weight on it at all that it might topple.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s 46-year-old son, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, ran out to help. `` People who were injured were asking ` Can you come and help me, please help me,''' he said. `` I worked on one carriage -LRB- rail car -RRB-, the one in my father's garden A girl was trapped in a luggage rack and, together with a neighbor, I helped her free. I also gave assistance to an elderly lady who had been badly injured and stayed with her until the doctor arrived,'' he said. One man watched the collision from his bedroom window, shouted to his wife to call the police, then grabbed a sledgehammer and headed out back with his young son. Other neighbors gathered up sheets and blankets and clambered up the high embankment to try to reach the injured. One woman named <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> said, `` My husband went along the gardens and began smashing windows to get people out.'' `` We used ladders as stretchers to carry the people out,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` The people were just in a big jumble, one on top of the other.'' Police soon were on the scene using their truncheons to break windows. The sides of the high embankment were so steep that emergency teams had to haul each other up using ropes secured at the top. Doctors had to climb into the rail cars to treat the trapped while firefighters cut them free. Because of the difficulty of getting stretchers to the scene, rescuers used anything flat to carry the injured away _ ladders, even a shed door. British Rail rescue workers in bright orange coats, and firefighters in brilliant yellow dotted the muddy rail line. <PERSON> Meesha </PERSON> <PERSON> Footer </PERSON>, 18, said she saw injured people being brought from the mangled railroad cars. `` I could hear people shouting and groaning,'' she said. `` There was a lot of blood and I saw one body covered with a blanket and there was one man with his leg hanging off.'' Trees growing between the embankment and the houses appeared to have prevented at least three of the cars from tumbling further down the embankment into people's homes. About 20 muddy survivors limped into the nearby Jolly Farmer pub. `` There was not much I could do for them except make gallons of coffee and let them use the telephone,'' said proprietor <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> on Saturday postponed a scheduled joint excavation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to search for the remains of missing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said. A 14-member team of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts was to fly to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> aboard two C-130 transport planes Sunday morning for the dig, but the Laotians did not give the planes clearance to enter, spokesman <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON> refused to comment when asked why <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> put the project on hold. However, the Laotians may have been irritated when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> earlier this week criticized them for allegedly failing to cooperate in the war against narcotics. An annual report that Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> lists a handful of countries that it declares ineligible for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid because of their support for drug trafficking. In the report, which was released Wednesday, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recommended that <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> be added to that list. The report said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe opium production is expanding in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and that heroin is being refined there for export through <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said there is evidence that Laotian officials are involved in the processing and smuggling of drugs. When that charge surfaced in last year's narcotics report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> government issued a stern denial. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to account for 547 Americans listed as missing in action in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. Many were airmen who flew reconnaissance and bombing missions. <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> had conducted four joint excavations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The first one was in Feb. 1985. The Pentagon said the latest excavation was to have been conducted in an area in southern <LOCATION> Savannakhet </LOCATION> province which a U.S.-Laotian team had surveyed last December. However, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no record of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plane crashing there. <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team had planned to work 8-10 days at the site.

<HEAD>Official Slams Breshnev; Gorbachev Approves Of Hungary's Multiparty
System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A senior official on Saturday said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was reduced to `` a kind of servility'' to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> during the regime of Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. The comments by <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Szueroes </PERSON> came a day after Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was reported as approving of <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>'s plans to introduce a multi-party system. Szueroes, in an interview in the <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemzet </ORGANIZATION> daily, first praised the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 1945 `` liberation'' of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to remove `` one of the most backward and poorest feudal-capitalist regimes.'' However, he was reported as saying after 1948 `` relations no longer developed in the spirit of equal rights and mutual benefits. `` The <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> doctrine -LRB- of limited sovereignty of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s allies -RRB- caused a further deformation, accompanied by great power aspects on the one side, and a kind of servility on the other, as well as insistence on certain dogmas until the mid-1980s,'' <PERSON> Szueroes </PERSON> was quoted as saying <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s `` servility'' was not explained. But under the leadership of former Premier <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> heeded a Soviet call to join in the invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 1968 to crush the short-lived `` Prague Spring'' reforms spearheaded by then party leader <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> was the only <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact country that refused to take part in the military intervention. <PERSON> Szueroes </PERSON> also said, `` The antipathy and reservations with which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and, in general, the socialist world, followed the reform process in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was a fundamental cause of the halt to the reform.'' One victim of <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s halt to the economic reform was <PERSON> Reszoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, its chief architect, who was ousted from the Politburo in 1973. As <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> was removed in May last year, <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> joined the Politburo again and now serves also in the government. <PERSON> Szueroes </PERSON>'s comments were an indication of gradually increasing openness in exposing the political shortcomings and economic failures during <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s 32-year tenure. Word that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> does not oppose Hungarian moves toward introducing a multi-party system came from Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> as he was traveling back to <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> from a visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` The general secretary -LRB- of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- welcomed the idea of pluralism -LRB- in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> -RRB-, since he considers the -LRB- process of -RRB- representation, institutionalization and confrontation of opinions and interests ... to be at the core of democracy,'' <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> late Friday. According to <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Soviety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> seeks pluralism within a one-party system, yet he would not reprimand the <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> leadership for its decision to introduce a multi-party system. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reportedly stressed that `` a multi-party system should not be seen as a panacea.'' In the interview with <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemzet </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Szueroes </PERSON> made clear that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s political links with the Soviet bloc alliance system must not prejudice its economic interests. The Hungarian economy has serious interests in its cooperation with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Szueroes </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` This, however, must be based on economic advantages, and affiliation with the same -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- alliance system must be clearly separated from asserting the economic interests.'' Before he went to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> bluntly stated that <ORGANIZATION> COMECON </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet-dominated Eastern trading alliance, brings more disadvantages than advantages for member countries. <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, too, as saying that <ORGANIZATION> COMECON </ORGANIZATION> should undergo `` a drastic transformation.''

 Two men, including an illegal alien with a history of attacking police officers, were charged Saturday in the slaying of a plainclothes policeman who was killed with his own revolver, police said. <PERSON> Renaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayside </PERSON>, 23, and <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Haneiph </PERSON>, 22, were picked up within an hour of the shooting early Friday of Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Machate </PERSON>, officials said. Rayside was charged with first-degree murder and criminal possession of a loaded firearm _ Machate's revolver. <PERSON> Haneiph </PERSON>, who is also an illegal alien, was charged with felonious assault on a police officer and criminal possession of a dangerous weapon, police said. Machate, 25, was the first <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> police officer killed in the line of duty this year and the second law enforcement officer slain in the city in less than three days. An undercover <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent was shot to death Tuesday. <PERSON> Machate </PERSON> lost his gun during a struggle with Rayside after the officer and a partner stopped some men acting suspiciously at a location known for drug deals. He died from a single bullet that hit him in the left side, just under his bulletproof vest, authorities said. Rayside, a native of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, served two years in state prison for attempted robbery and assaulting a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police officer in 1982, said Sgt. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, a police spokesman. Several months after being freed on parole in 1985, Rayside allegedly attacked another city police officer during an arrest on possession of stolen property charges. He pleaded guilty to resisting arrest and was sentenced to time served, the police said. <PERSON> Haneiph </PERSON>, also a native of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, has served prison time on attempted murder, weapons and other charges, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Dubcek Sues Party Hardliner For Slander In '68 Soviet Invasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Czechoslovak <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> has sued a longtime rival for slander stemming from the Soviet-led invasion of two decades ago, sources revealed Saturday. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> filed a lawsuit last summer against former Politburo hardliner <PERSON> Vasil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilak </PERSON>, but well-informed sources say the case has yet to come to court. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was 46 when he took over as party chief Jan. 5, 1968. He was ousted in the wake of the Soviet-led invasion of seven months later that crushed the `` Prague Spring'' reforms in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. He alleges that <PERSON> Bilak </PERSON> slandered him by saying that <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> had signed a statement in 1968 saying that <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> was threatened by counterrevolution. The charge by <PERSON> Bilak </PERSON> would run counter to <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s image as a visionary reformer who presaged the openness and reforms now embraced by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bilak </PERSON>, a longtime party ideologist associated with the policies of former Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonik </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, resigned from all his political offices on Dec. 15. He was strongly believed to have been opposed to sweeping economic reforms favored by former Czechoslovak Premier <PERSON> Lubomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Strougal </PERSON>, who stepped down in October 1988. <PERSON> Bilak </PERSON> was one of three senior party officials reputed to have asked the Soviets to intervene in order to crush <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s liberal reforms. The other two were the late <PERSON> Drahomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Indra </PERSON>, who is still on the 13-man Prague Politburo. According to the sources in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> with direct contact to <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, the onetime popular leader filed the slander charges in summer 1988, when <PERSON> Bilak </PERSON> was still a senior member of the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> leadership. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s action was reportedly based on interviews published in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in which <PERSON> Bilak </PERSON> alleged that <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, at a 1968 meeting with <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact leaders, had signed a document saying that <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> was threatened by counterrevolution. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was said to have denied the claim, insisting he had never seen such a document. Both <PERSON> Bilak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, who worked as a forestry employee in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> until his retirement, now live in the Slovak capital as pensioners. Should the case ever reach a courtroom it would be the first known lawsuit involving two former top-echelon Communist functionaries.

 Crews worked Saturday to remove thick oil that had washed in along a 2-mile stretch of shoreline, while the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> checked damage to a tanker that spilled 33,000 gallons of oil when it ran aground, authorities said. Coast Guard officials said it appeared no more oil would come ashore, and made a major revision in the estimate of the amount of oil spilled, which originally had been put at 117,000 gallons. The 800-foot tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> floated free of a reef Friday evening, about 24 hours after a storm drove it aground off a little-used stretch of coast 15 miles west of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> and its famed <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Goff </PERSON> said that of 92,000 gallons of bunker fuel oil feared lost from the tanker's ruptured fuel tank, 84,000 were found in the tank Saturday, meaning 8,000 gallons were lost. About 25,000 gallons of crude oil spilled into the ocean Thursday when the ship tore away from its mooring and floating hoses unloading the oil pulled free. Some of the spilled oil washed to sea during the night, said <PERSON> Randal </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Grydziak </PERSON>, with the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. `` For the most part, it looks pretty good,'' <PERSON> O'Grydziak </PERSON> said. `` Mother Nature overnight has through some tide changes done away with a lot of the -LRB- petroleum -RRB- product.'' He said cleanup crews worked to remove oil-soaked vegetation, soak up oil in water pools in the coral reef and rake the affected beaches. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> had closed beaches along the soiled shoreline, <PERSON> O'Grydziak </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Libert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Landgraf </PERSON>, deputy director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> and Natural Resources, said there was no immediate evidence of injury or death to marine life or birds. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> flew over the tanker and shoreline Saturday morning and said no more oil was visible around the ship or off the coast. `` I really think most of it's ashore,'' <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said. Coast Guard Lt. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said officials at the scene believed the pollution would be limited to the shoreline already affected. `` They're saying, ` If you have to have an oil disaster, this is the one to have,''' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION> Biological-Chemical Strike Team arrived from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> late Friday and was standing by with a floating boom that skims oil off the ocean surface, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. He said the team had not decided whether to use the 612-foot boom, which is towed between two ships. The Clean Islands Council, a <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> oil spill cleanup cooperative, was contracted to perform the cleanup by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, the Houston-based domestic oil and gas division of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, will pay for the costs of the cleanup, according to <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> attorney Officials had planned to wait until high tide early Saturday to attempt to remove the tanker from the reef. But it floated free on its own late Friday after workers pumped off more than 9,400 tons of ballast water and some of the remaining 3.8 million gallons of crude oil, lightening the ship to prevent more crude oil or ship's fuel from spilling, said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartvigsen </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The tanker was moved to deep water five miles offshore and a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship and three tugboats had lines attached to the vessel, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> salvage ship also were with the ship. There was no problem keeping the tanker afloat, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. The ship ran aground late Thursday after high wind and rough seas tore it from its offshore mooring. The <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> had unloaded 400,000 barrels of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> crude oil at the mooring a mile off the Hawaiian Independent Refinery at the time, said Capt. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Piche </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>

 <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> on Saturday asked <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to help mobilize international support for solving the country's perennial flood problems, an official said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, who has visited <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and will fly to <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> on Monday as part of a tour of the region, met Foreign Minister <PERSON> Anisul </PERSON> <PERSON> Islam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> and responded favorably, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity. The source, who is close to the talks, gave no further details. More than 1,400 people were killed and 25 million were left homeless last summer when floods submerged three-fourths of this country of 110 million people. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> has been seeking a regional approach, involving <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, for solving the flood problems. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has repeatedly rejected the idea, saying <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> was trying to `` internationalize'' a bilateral matter between the two neighbors. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s major rivers originate in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. During the monsoon season, the rivers are swollen by rains and cascade down from the Himalayan mountains and foothills. Although parts of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> also are prone to floods, the surging rivers' greatest fury usually is unleashed on the low-lying nation of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> And Bangladeshi environmental and development officials have said deforestation in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> contributes to the problem, because of a decline in soil retention of water. The independent <ORGANIZATION> Sangbad </ORGANIZATION> newspaper and other <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> dailies recently reported <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> has drawn up a 6 billion dollar flood control plan. The government has neither confirmed nor denied the report. A joint U.N.-Bangladesh task force has said the country needs at least 1.1 billion dollars for reconstruction and flood relief after last year's flood. With a per capital annual income of about $ 160, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> is one of the world's poorest nations.

 <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> have agreed to combine in an `` old-fashioned merger,'' creating an $ 18 billion company that would be the world's largest media and entertainment empire, it was announced Saturday. The resulting conglomerate, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, would include publishing, film and music interests with estimated annual revenue of $ 10 billion, the companies said. The company would surpass <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s Australian-based <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as the world's biggest company in the field of media and entertainment, which are two of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' most successful exports. `` There's never been a deal like this in the media business. This is going to be a frighteningly powerful company,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reidy </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Some of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most famous names would combine forces if the deal, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval, is consummated. Time is the nation's leading magazine company, with such titles as Time, People and Sports Illustrated, along with <ORGANIZATION> Time-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION> and the Book-of-the-Month Club. Time also owns two of the nation's largest pay-cable television networks, <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cinemax </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> has major movie and television production interests, including <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> and Barbra Streisand are regulars with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Speilberg </PERSON> makes some of his movies for the studios. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s recording artists include <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, Z.Z Top, U-2, <ORGANIZATION> Fleetwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, through its $ 1.2 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in January, owns such TV programs as <ORGANIZATION> Knots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Landing </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Alf </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Falcon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION>. The companies' cable television properties combined would be the second biggest in the country, behind <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The deal is a merger of equals rather than an acquisition, and thus can not be directly compared to such mega-deals as the nearly $ 25 billion leveraged buyout late last year of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> investment firm. The new company will have co-chief executive officers and a board of directors made up of equal numbers named by each company. By merging in what is legally a tax-free pooling of interests, the companies avoid the financial drain that usually accompanies huge acquisitions. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, called it `` an old-fashioned merger.'' `` I think we can contrast this to a lot of other transactions we see going on in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where companies end up being over-leveraged and so constrained they ca n't do anything,'' <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> said. `` This is a very important business for this country and we think it's significant that we're forming what will be the largest global media company, and that it's American-owned and U.S.-based,'' <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> said. Time executives have been predicting recently that there will eventually be about half a dozen global powers in the media and entertainment business and have vowed to make their company one of them. `` To compete in our particular business, media and entertainment, the ability to product materials in the various forms of media and to distribute them on a worldwide basis is critical,'' <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> would be jointly led by <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Munro </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, his counterpart at <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, according to a statement from both companies. `` Our complementary organizations are a perfect fit,'' <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Together we will be a worldwide leader in all our businesses, enabling us to create and innovate in ways each could only dream about before.'' Besides <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, other big world media companies include <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bertelsmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The merger of the companies would continue a trend of consolidation in the media business, marked by such deals as <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 2 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. The deal would also help protect each company against unwanted suitors. Time has occasionally been the subject of speculation as a takeover target, and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> has had uneasy relations with its largest shareholder, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> said the companies would be stronger together than apart but declined to give details on plans `` We have lots of ideas but we feel at this point it's not appropriate to discuss things,'' he said. Time would benefit from <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s strong international distribution, while <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> would benefit from the strong programming, <PERSON> Reidy </PERSON> said. Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> are headquartered within one block of each other in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Rockefeller Center, and the top advisers to each firm are also within a block or two. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> said negotiations on some form of business communication, such as a merger of cable interests, had proceeded off and on for two years. He said intense negotiations, including several all-night sessions, occurred in the last few weeks. Legally, the deal calls for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shareholders to receive 0.465 share of Time for each share of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> they own. Since there are potentially 177.2 million <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> common shares, and <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> closed Friday at $ 109.12 -LCB- a share, that puts a value on <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> of about $ 9 billion if the deal had closed Friday. In addition, there are 56.6 million shares of Time outstanding, giving it a market value of a little more than $ 6 billion based on Friday's close. Debt and preferred shares account for the balance of the $ 18 billion market value of the proposed new company. <PERSON> Reidy </PERSON> said he doubted that another suitor would enter to bust up the deal by bidding for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, even though the Time stock they would receive comes to less than $ 51 per <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> share, not much above <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s close of $ 45.87 -LCB- on Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 87 -LCB- cents Friday to a 52-week high. Among other things, because it is a true merger, shareholders of the companies do not have to pay any capital gains tax on the deal. Any would-be acquirer would have to pay a substantial premium to make up for that tax, <PERSON> Reidy </PERSON> said. The companies did not give a timetable for completion of the deal. In a lock-up agreement designed to block outsiders from attempting to break up the deal with a higher offer for either company, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> agreed to exchange about 12 percent of each other's stock without waiting for shareholder approval.

 A sea lion relocated to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> in a campaign to stop the mammals from feasting on local fish returned to its hunting grounds here after traveling nearly 300 miles, a wildlife official said Saturday. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> sea lion spotted near the <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> ship locks Friday afternoon was the first relocated animal to return. `` He obviously likes it here,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION>. `` He knows a good life when he finds one.'' The sea lions wait by the locks and pick off steelhead, a seagoing trout, and salmon that are en route to their spawning grounds. Officials have trapped 18 <ORGANIZATION> sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> lions </ORGANIZATION> so far using a floating cage. Two died after being sedated for tagging and five more were released at the locks because of cold weather. To return, the sea lion had to swim about 150 miles up the coast, turn right, swim another 100 miles through the Strait of <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fuca </LOCATION>, turn right again and paddle the remaining 35 miles to the locks. Trapping will probably resume Monday, and officials are confident they can catch the remaining 13 or so animals, including the one who returned, for relocation to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Lebanon Concerned At Reports Israel Will Expand Security Zone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Moslem and Christian cabinets in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government on Saturday issued statements voicing concern over a reported plan by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to expand its self-declared security zone in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads the Moslem cabinet, told <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s envoy to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakhoury </PERSON>, to `` draw the world's attention to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s intentions,'' an official statement said. The rival Christian cabinet of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, in a statement published by the independent daily An-Nahar, expressed `` deep concern over the statements made by some Israeli military commanders which clearly revealed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s intention to widen the area of what it calls the security zone.'' Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Youssi </PERSON> <PERSON> Peled </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern front commander,, was quoted Thursday as saying he was considering expanding the security zone. Voice of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> radio, the mouthpiece of the Israeli-allied <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militia that operates in the zone, said <PERSON> Peled </PERSON> wanted to include five Druse villages in the strip. The broadcast said the move was requested by unnamed leaders of the Mimes, Khalwat, <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Senta </PERSON>, Kfir and <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Ata </PERSON> villages located in the central <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> valley </LOCATION>, a few miles north of the security zone. The Moslem-run Voice of the Nation radio, based in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, broadcast statements issued in the five villages that denied making such a request or having contacts with the Israelis in the security zone. `` <PERSON> Peled </PERSON>'s statement reflects his intention to widen the security zone,'' the broadcast said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> kept control of a 6-to-10-mile deep zone when it withdrew the bulk of its occupation army from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in summer 1985. The strip extending from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coast in the west to the slopes of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION> in the east serves as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla attacks on northern Israeli settlements. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has had rival Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> governments since last September, when outgoing President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to head an interim military cabinet after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> failed to elect a new president. Moslems refused to accept <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s appointment and pledged loyalty to <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who served as prime minister in the <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> administration.

 The 29th launch of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s Ariane rocket was canceled three hours before lift-off Saturday night after two cables were accidentally disconnected, officials said.

It was not immediately clear whether the rocket could be launched on Sunday night. It was the second launch postponement for the Ariane 4 rocket, which was originally scheduled for lift-off on Tuesday but was delayed by a strike at the launch base here. The cables that were accidentally detached served to ventilate the MOP-1 European weather satellite, one of two payloads, and purge oxygen reservoirs.

<TEXT>
 Guerrillas and government officials from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> on Saturday resumed peace talks interrupted by the shooting death of a leftist leader at <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s airport. The talks were the third between the two sides this year in search of a way to end a quarter-century of political violence in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, leader of the delegation from the rebels' April 19 Movement, told reporters before entering the talks that rebels had `` a concrete proposal'' to present to the government He did not say what the proposal contained but described it as `` what we think has to be done on an emergency basis to strengthen and broaden this process to respond to death with life, to darkness with hope and to war with peace.'' Before Friday's session <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said the talks were intended to set the stage for a peace agreement in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruedo </PERSON>, the government's representative, said the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> government continued to support the talks as a move toward peace. `` It is a process that can be difficult but is a light of hope for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> at this time,'' he said. `` The road that must be followed is the road to democracy. The majority of Colombians believe that democracy is the solution,'' he said. Before entering the session at a luxury hotel, representatives of both sides condemned the killing Friday of <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antequera </PERSON>, an executive board member of the Marxist-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, and another man and the wounding of eight others at <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Antequera </PERSON>, whose party was formed by the guerrillas, was the apparent target of the attack, authorities in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> said. He had received death threats from right-wing paramilitary organizations in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. He and other political leaders, accompanied by bodyguards, had arrived at the airport to fly to <LOCATION> Cucuta </LOCATION>, near the Venezuelan border and <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast. An official from the Attorney General's office also was killed and bodyguards killed one of the attackers, police said. Three other attackers were captured. More than 75,000 Colombians have died in political violence in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in the past 25 years. More than 1,000 have been killed in the last three years. The April 19 Movement is the largest of the six insurgent groups and has about 10,000 members. The first day of talks ended early Friday when delegates learned of the shooting. The talks were a continuation of meetings between the guerrillas and government Jan. 10 and Feb. 8 in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Opposition Seeks Roh's Resignation In Referendum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opposition leaders agreed Saturday to seek the resignation of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo in a referendum on his performance the government promised to hold in April. Leaders of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s three rival opposition parties, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong-pil </PERSON>, issued a joint declaration after narrowing differences on key political issues. The three agreed on a common approach to the referendum <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> had promised in December 1987, just before he won presidential elections. The declaration issued Saturday urged <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to hold a promised referendum after `` bringing about sizable results'' in redressing corruption and power abuses left over from his predecessor, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. `` Otherwise, we will launch a no-confidence campaign to push for <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s resignation,'' it said. The three Kims accused <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> of insincerity in introducing reforms. The opposition agreement came as the government began preparing for the referendum, aimed at seeking an early settlement of thorny political issues without damaging its credibility. Senior government leaders agreed Saturday to hold the referendum in early April, but they suggested that in the referendum, voters should assess the administration's handling of specific issues rather than its overall performance. The government party lacks broad public support, but party leaders have said <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is confident of victory in a referendum. Despite broad reforms <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has introduced since taking office in February, opponents have staged protests demanding his ouster. Recent surveys show many South Koreans believe the government failed to take firm action to deal with past government abuses. Dissidents and radical students identify <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> with <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s authoritarian government <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has asked the nation to pardon <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> since the former president went into rural exile last November after making an open apology for misdeeds during his seven-year administration. In Saturday's meeting, government leaders reaffirmed their rejection of an opposition demand that <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> be made to testify before the opposition-controlled <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on human rights violations and other abuses.

Although his first job was as a newspaper reporter and he was involved in the news industry for much of his life, <PERSON> Thayer </PERSON> did not fashion himself a journalist. `` I do not have printer's ink in my blood,'' he once said. <PERSON> Kiernan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thayer </PERSON> advised numerous politicians, including President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Virginia Teacher Charged With Desecrating Flag in Banner Brouhaha</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A schoolteacher in town for a seminar became entangled in a controversy over the use of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag in an art exhibit Saturday when she was arrested for walking on the Stars and Stripes. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Willhofft </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, was charged with desecrating the flag, a felony, in the first such arrest resulting from the exhibit at the School of the Art Institute of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The arrest came as two dozen critics of the exhibit picketed the art school and a state senator picked the flag up, removing it from the work, for the second day in a row. <PERSON> Willhofft </PERSON>'s attorney acknowledged that she stepped on the flag, but said she had no criminal or political motive. Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said the charge constituted `` harassment'' by the man who filed the complaint, <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> <PERSON> Choate </PERSON>, 47, of suburban <LOCATION> Lockport </LOCATION>, who opposes the work. `` And I would think the state's attorney's office would have something better to do than prosecute an innocent tourist,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> added. At issue is a work by art student <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> titled `` What is the Proper Way to Display a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Flag?'' which is part of a minority students' exhibit. The work features a montage of photographs depicting flag-draped coffins and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> burning the American flag, plus a book that invites viewer comments. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag is positioned on the floor in front of the book in such a way that viewers are likely to step on the flag to write in the book. The exhibit was closed to the public last weekend after veterans groups complained it was illegal and disrespectful to the flag and sued to try to force the school to remove it from the floor. Following a circuit judge's ruling Thursday, the show reopened. On Friday, state Sen. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudycz </PERSON> was detained briefly by officers after he picked the flag up from the floor. He did it again on Saturday, and asked the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney's office to decide whether the exhibit violates laws against desecrating the flag The flag was put back in the exhibit. <PERSON> Willhofft </PERSON>, who teaches grades 6-8, was attending a conference of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION>, said another of her attorneys, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaner </PERSON>. `` She had a free day, she was going to have lunch, she was going to shop at <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Schaner </PERSON> said. `` She had no intention of making a political protest. She just went to see the famous Art Institute of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` She stepped on the flag,'' he said. `` She wanted to see what was in the book.''

<TEXT>
 The fractious <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday elected a slate of new leaders to replace radicals ousted from power last year, and one of its most famous radicals announced she is quitting the party. The Greens, who have been trying to heal ideological rifts among opposing factions, elected three new top leaders who represent a broad section of party interests. The 39,000-member party sprang from radical environmentalist and leftist peace movements in the 1970s. The last party leadership was dominated by radicals including <PERSON> Jutta </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditfurth </PERSON>, who stunned the party congress in <LOCATION> Duisburg </LOCATION> by announcing before the vote she plans to quit the party. She bitterly denounced moderates who want to put the <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> on a new political course. Ms. <PERSON> Ditfurth </PERSON> charged the party was practicing `` policies of exclusion against the left'' and was `` adapting a traditional political structure.'' The Greens' new leaders are <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammerbacher </PERSON>, from the party's moderate `` realos'' -LRB- realists -RRB- faction; <PERSON> Verena </PERSON> <PERSON> Krieger </PERSON>, who represents interests further to the left; and <PERSON> Ralf </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuecks </PERSON>, whose views fall between those of his two colleagues None of the former leaders ran for re-election. Ms. <PERSON> Ditfurth </PERSON> is head of the `` fundis'' -LRB- fundamentalists -RRB-, who are locked in a bitter ideological struggle with the `` realos.'' The dispute centers on the pragmatists' willingness to work within established political procedures and the fundamentalists' insistence that the party steer clear of wooing the mainstream parties In her speech, Ms. <PERSON> Ditfurth </PERSON> said the party had been compromising too many of its principles. `` The goal of this is apparently the formation of a government with the Social Democrats,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ditfurth </PERSON> said. The Social Democrats are <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s main opposition party, and will be going up against Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in next year's federal elections. Polls indicate the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have lost support over the last few months, opening the possibility the party might not be able to put together a parliamentary majority after federal elections. Ms. <PERSON> Ditfurth </PERSON> said she will probably leave the <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> following the 1990 elections. She also denounced the Alternative List -LRB- AL -RRB-, the <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> sister party, for its plans to join a coalition government in that city, saying it had abandoned principles it had shared with the Greens for years. The Christian Democrats were ousted from power in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> elections last month, and the victorious Social Democrats are now negotiating with the Alternative List about forming a new government.

<HEAD>Survey Shows Americans Want Senate to Reject Tower Confirmation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most Americans believe the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should reject the nomination of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, according to a poll published in Sunday editions of the Los Angeles Times. The nationwide telephone poll of 1,046 adults, conducted as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate on Tower began last week, also shows that most people dismiss the argument that a president should be able to appoint anybody he chooses to a Cabinet post. The poll, which was done Wednesday and Thursday, found that 44 percent of those interviewed believe that Tower should be rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, while 35 percent believe he should be confirmed. The remaining 21 percent were unsure. The poll also found that 82 percent of those surveyed rejected assertions by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders that `` the President should be given a free hand to pick whoever he chooses for his cabinet.'' The poll indicates that people are less concerned about Tower's alleged heavy drinking and womanizing than about his impartiality in dealing with defense contractors because of his prior work as a defense consultant However, 64 percent of those surveyed said they did not believe Tower would abide by his pledge to forsake all liquor during the duration of his service as Secretary of Defense. The poll showed that President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued to enjoy a relatively high job rating, 59 percent approval to 13 percent disapproval. While 61 percent said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination of Tower had not influenced their overall impression of the President, 29 percent said that the appointment had caused their opinions of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to fall. The poll found that 44 percent disapproved of the Tower nomination and 38 percent were n't sure, while just 18 percent approved of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination. The Times Poll, directed by I.A. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, had a margin of error of 4 percentage points in either direction.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> has moved out front in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration effort to salvage his nomination, pleading the case publicly and setting the stage for a possible last-ditch stand on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. A White House official insisted Saturday the effort is not a lost cause. `` We've still got some good prospects,'' among Democrats who would be needed to provide a majority vote in Tower's favor, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` We could still pull it out,'' the official said. `` I admit it's very tough. Tower, in comments published in Sunday editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would be `` damning the president's judgment'' if it rejects his nomination and said he will not withdraw unless requested to do so by the president. `` The important thing is a majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is going to subordinate the president's judgment to its own in the selection of people that the president feels he can rely on,'' Tower said in the interview with a small group of reporters. Tower, who has pledged to abstain from alcoholic beverages if he becomes defense secretary, reiterated his contention that he does not have a drinking problem but said he has not stopped drinking entirely. `` I still have a glass of wine in the evening with dinner, although it's not on a daily basis,'' he said. As the number of Democrats on record against the nomination grew, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> raised the prospect of bringing Tower to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor to answer allegations against him. `` The request would be that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> be allowed to come to this chamber, to stand in this well, and to answer his critics face-to-face, charge-by-charge, rumor-by-rumor and fact-by-fact,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> did not formally ask permission for Tower, once a senator himself, to speak from the floor, but said he was considering introducing such a motion. `` If we owe Senator Tower anything, we owe him the right to say, ` I've had my day in court,''' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he would be `` happy to consider any request'' by the minority leader, but gave no indication on how the proposal would fare. If Tower came to the floor to answer questions, it would be the first such instance for a Cabinet nominee and only the sixth time in <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> history for a non-member to be questioned. On three occasions in the 1800s, newspaper reporters were called before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to answer questions about where they obtained leaked information from closed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proceedings which appeared in their stories. In 1933, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sergeant at arms was called before the chamber to answer questions about an article he had published alleging that senators were selling their votes. And in 1934, three airline officials were called to answer questions about government contracting with airmail carriers. In the meantime, Tower planned to appear on a major network interview show, <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation.'' The national television appearance follows a week in which the embattled nominee pledged to abstain from alcohol if confirmed and lashed out at the double-standard that existed in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ all attempts to help his faltering cause. The need for last-ditch efforts came in the wake of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inability to convince a single Democrat to support the nominee. The administration conducted two days of intensive lobbying with the president holding one-on-one Oval Office sessions with swing Democrats and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> courting senators on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, on a weekend ski trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, said Saturday that once <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., came out against the nomination, `` we knew that it would be an uphill battle. `` This nomination hinges really on one individual in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and that is the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` Once he decided to go against the president we knew that it was going to be difficult.'' The numbers against the nomination continued to rise on Friday. Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., said the nation `` can not take a chance'' with Tower <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, who met privately at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> earlier this week and had hinted he might support the nominee, said Tower `` is not the proper person for this sensitive position in these critical times.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey of senators showed 47 Democrats and Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, either solidly against the nomination or leaning against, and 40 Republicans either solidly committed or leaning toward confirmation. The Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> huddled on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor over a major administration concern _ <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>. Among the other senators Republicans hope to convince is conservative Democrat <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, said the senator planned to `` take the weekend to get away from the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> distraction and give it serious consideration in private.''

 A federal judge reserved judgment Saturday on whether to block sympathy strikes by railroad workers ready to honor <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> machinists' picket lines, the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> told lawyers for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area commuter rail lines and the striking machinists at 9:30 p.m. that he would not make a decision Saturday, said <ORGANIZATION> MTA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>. `` The judge advised the lawyers to be prepared to come back tomorrow sometime after 10 a.m. to possibly answer further questions,'' he said. <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said it was unclear if the lawyers would be summoned to meet with <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> on Sunday, but said <ORGANIZATION> MTA </ORGANIZATION> lawyers were prepared to meet with him. The <ORGANIZATION> MTA </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commuter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, joined by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION>, asked <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> earlier Saturday to issue a temporary restraining order against the threatened sympathy strike, <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said. Union mechanics and baggage handlers on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> have said they plan to mount secondary picket lines at commuter railroads on Monday morning, particularly in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> have already obtained a court order aimed at preventing a sympathy strike. <ORGANIZATION> SEPTA </ORGANIZATION> officials said the authority hoped its court order, issued Friday night, would keep railroad union workers on the job even if the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> sets up pickets Monday. According to the complaint filed Friday, <ORGANIZATION> SEPTA </ORGANIZATION> maintained that under their contract, its nine railroad unions and their 1,000 members can honor picket lines set up by other unions only if those unions have contracts with <ORGANIZATION> SEPTA </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> said it was taking steps to assign extra buses Monday morning to help move commuters in case of a strike. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the rail system on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> MBTA </ORGANIZATION>, had no immediate plans to seek a court order to stop the expected walkout, a spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. About 25,000 people travel by <ORGANIZATION> MBTA </ORGANIZATION> commuter railways on a typical workday. In their request for an injunction, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area transit systems made an argument similar to <ORGANIZATION> SEPTA </ORGANIZATION>'s, saying the employees are `` contractually obligated to work and thus must cross any picket line established by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gourdine </PERSON>, director of labor relations at the <ORGANIZATION> MTA </ORGANIZATION>. Union leaders at the metropolitan-area rail lines had said they would honor the picket lines and bring to a halt the trains that carry some 320,000 commuters into <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> each weekday. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Yule </PERSON>, general chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> LIRR </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest commuter railroad, said he could not immediately say how he would advise his workers if <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> issued a restraining order. `` It's a union leader's dilemma,'' he said. Should the strike go on, <ORGANIZATION> MTA </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON> predicted `` absolute chaos,'' even though officials made plans for such things as extra buses and traffic control people to try to handle the crush of commuters. No transit job actions were reported Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> LIRR </ORGANIZATION> has about 135,000 daily riders, <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> carries 95,000 people from the northern suburbs and NJ Transit carries about 90,000. The Port Authority-Transit <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> line, or PATH, which carries commuters from northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, did not take part in the request for the injunction, officials said.

 About 500 protesters jeered at up to 100 neo-Nazi skinheads attending a white supremacist rally that had been billed as an `` Aryan Woodstock,'' and some demonstrators scuffled with a <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klansman </PERSON>. About 200 police, some in riot gear, kept the demonstrators in a soggy field about a mile from the whites-only gathering in <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> about 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. As a cold rain fell, protesters yelled `` Nazis go home!'' and other taunts, and wielded placards with such messages as `` My Family Died Because of Facism.'' The protesters became enraged when a man who identified himself as <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Albers </PERSON> of the Modesto chapter of the Klan tried to walk through the crowd. <PERSON> Albers </PERSON> and some of the demonstrators scuffled. Gravel and sticks flew until law enforcement officers using nightsticks brought the crowd under control. No arrests or injuries were reported earlier, but <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrell </PERSON>, 88, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, was slightly injured earlier when he was dragged across a barbed-wire fence by demonstrators when he tried unsuccessfully to enter the rally. Asked about the skinheads, <PERSON> Herrell </PERSON> said, `` I think they're wonderful people. `` I do n't want to destroy other races. I just want to keep them separate,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Spittler </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialists </ORGANIZATION>, said as the rally began Friday night. Among the protesters Saturday was <PERSON> Irv </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, national chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. `` People of good will can not ignore this,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. `` No matter how small their number, there has to be a statement against their ideology. This is a battle of humanity versus the forces of evil ... if we do n't expose it, it's kind of like letting a cancer grow on the body politic.'' Organizer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON>, a former Klan leader who heads a group called White Aryan Resistance, had estimated that 2,000 people would attend, but law enforcement officials estimated attendance at 30 to 100. <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Leabo </PERSON>, who flew over the rally site in a helicopter, said he saw about 20 skinheads, many of them under a tarp. <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> flags decorated the rally, <PERSON> Leabo </PERSON> said. The event was initially billed as an `` Aryan Woodstock'' because organizers had hoped to present performances by the skinhead bands Midtown Boot Boys from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, the Hammerheads from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hakenkreuz </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. However, <ORGANIZATION> Napa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON> ruled that a permit was needed for the musical portion of the event. <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON> rejected the county's argument that the assembly would be a public nuisance. <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON>, who had argued a permit was not needed because the concert was to be held on private property and admission was by invitation only, decided to go ahead with the political portion of the rally. Officials closed nearby state Highway 12 at Interstate 80 in <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION> and a road near <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> 29 </LOCATION> to head off trouble. The scene was tense, as demonstrators leaned over barbed-wire fences, screaming at a handful of skinheads watching them from atop a nearby hill. At one point, about six skinheads who tried to get into the rally got caught between police lines and protesters yelling insults. The white power rally was held on land owned by Dr. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonsdale </PERSON> of nearby <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lonsdale </PERSON> fled <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1937 with his Jewish family when he was 4 years old, family friend <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Coon </PERSON> told The Sacramento Bee. <PERSON> Lonsdale </PERSON>, a prominent 55-year-old specialist, had been told the gathering was to be an environmental rally but did not back out when he learned its true nature because he feared reprisals, said <PERSON> Coon </PERSON>, acting as <PERSON> Lonsdale </PERSON>'s spokesman. `` Would you like your house pushed over the hill? That's why he has n't spoken out against them,'' said <PERSON> Coon </PERSON>. `` He was told by the group that if he canceled out of this lease, they'd sue ... him, they'd ruin his practice,'' <PERSON> Coon </PERSON> added.

<TEXT>
 The government said Friday that <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s ruling military junta will `` return to the barracks'' next year after handing over power to an elected parliament The military has held sway in this <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation for 27 years. At a weekly news conference, government spokesman <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> denied rumors that the military would participate in general elections next year or that individual officers would resign commissions to take part. `` They -LRB- the military -RRB- will hand over power to the new parliament and return to the barracks,'' he said. <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> also warned <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s newly formed political parties to avoid links with foreign diplomatic missions in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. He said some parties were closely linked with such missions, but gave no details. Under a proposed election law announced on Wednesday, government employees, including military personnel and police, can not run for election. The proposal is being reviewed by <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s 233 political parties and the general public. In September, Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> and a group of military officers crushed pro-democracy demonstrations here. The general, now head of a military government, promised general elections in early 1990 and the end of one-party rule. At another news conference, <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> and Trade Minister Col. <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> announced Friday that as of April 1, government workers' salaries will be raised anywhere from 20 percent to 109 percent and the minimum wage will be nearly doubled. Salaries of armed forces personnel will be raised on a sliding scale at rates similar to those of the civil servants. There are about 1.2 million government employes, including members of the armed forces. <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> said increased tax collections and greater production at state enterprises would offset any inflationary effects. Civil servants have long complained about low wages and rising prices. Many joined anti-government demonstrations last year. Salaries now range from $ 34 to $ 258 a month. The minimum daily wage of $ 1.33 will be raised to $ 2.34. Pensions of retired government workers will also be increased. In another development, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border patrol police at Tak, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> guerrillas kept up attacks on the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Myawaddy </LOCATION> on Friday, firing mortar rounds that killed three villagers and wounded nine. Police Lt. Col. <PERSON> Manit </PERSON> <PERSON> Subsai-on </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> troops replied with artillery and mortar fire. According to <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> military intelligence reports, the <LOCATION> Karens </LOCATION> have been attacking the village, just inside the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> border, in retaliation for an army offensive on a <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> stronghold 38 miles away. The Karens for four decades have been fighting for greater autonomy.

<TEXT>
 A Jewish group met with Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> on Friday and said the military ruler promised to find two Nazi war criminals believed living in this country. Rabbi <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, director of B'nai B'rith <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Defamation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s department of Latin American Affairs, said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> pledged to `` investigate, locate, detain and expel'' the two war criminals. He said he would not identify the men for fear they would be alerted to the search and flee to avoid capture. `` He reiterated that <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> will not be a ship for pirates or a cave for thieves, and said they would rid the country of garbage such as Nazi war criminals,'' <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said after a 25-minute meeting with <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who seized power in the Feb. 3 coup that unseated president Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, made no public comment following the meeting. <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>' pledge of assistance contrasted sharply with the cold reception given to such requests by the <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> regime. In 1984, the newspaper of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> mocked the efforts of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> hunter <PERSON> Beate </PERSON> <PERSON> Klarsfeld </PERSON> to locate <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Mengele </PERSON>. Under the 1976-83 military government in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, requests for information or arrest of alleged Nazi war criminals were ignored, but since civilian President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> took office, three have been arrested, <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said. Also Friday, opposition leader <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> said his party may participate in May 1 national elections even if some of its electoral demands are denied. <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, after meeting <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, told reporters that `` the response to some of the terms of this package can be positive and others negative and that does not mean we will refuse to participate. `` We know we can not reach the perfection of democracy overnight, but we do want some reasonable conditions under which we can participate,'' he said. `` We only want these elections to be an improvement over the past.'' During the nearly 35-year military <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> dictatorship, several opposition parties refused to participate in elections, claiming they were fraudulent. The National Accord alliance of three opposition parties has asked <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> to delay elections until at least Sept. 1 to give them time to register supporters and organize campaigns. They also hope to eliminate a statute that allots two-thirds of the seats in <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> to the party that wins a majority of votes. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in power since 1947, is widely expected to dominate the elections. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> is the party's presidential candidate.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremist was convicted on Friday of killing six people, including three shot at an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> funeral, and was sentenced to life with the recommendation that he serve at least 30 years. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, 33, raised a clenched fist and shouted `` Long live Ulster! No surrender!'' as he was led away at <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> Crown Court. Judge <PERSON> Eoin </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said the people of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> had a right to long protection from such a `` dangerous and ruthless criminal.'' Police moved in to separate Roman Catholic and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> spectators who jeered at each other as Stone was taken away. Stone called himself a `` free-lance'' killer for outlawed sectarian organizations, but denied membership in groups that attack the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province's <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority. He told police he went to the funeral to kill <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> political leaders he knew would attend the burial in March 1988 of three <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members killed by British commandos in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has waged a 20-year guerrilla war to drive the British from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which is overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. Stone followed mourners from <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agnes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Milltown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> and got past <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> security men by saying their slogan in Gaelic: `` Our day will come.'' As the funeral began, he lobbed grenades into the crowd and opened fire with two guns. He said there were too many children and he could not shoot at his intended targets from <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing: <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, the president; vice president <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON>, and senior party official <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>. At one point, he told police, he gave a little girl a coin to move away from him. The crowd pursued as Stone ran between tombstones shooting, caught him and beat him until police took him away. Prosecutor <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Appleton </PERSON> said when the trial opened Feb. 20 that, when police told him he had killed at least two people, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> replied: `` Brilliant. I am game for anything.'' Stone also was convicted of killing <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a milkman, in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dermot </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON>, a bread deliver, near <LOCATION> Omagh </LOCATION>, and workman <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> McPolin </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Lisburn </LOCATION>.

Interior sources, declining to be identified, have said <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON> made no secret that he would have liked to remain at his current post in the new administration. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON> informed regional directors of the agency Friday that he planned to leave his post as director of the Fish and Wildlife Service March 15.

He said <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> only was told that bait had been spotted by routine aerial surveillance on water near <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>'s property and that Fish and Wildlife officials notified the senator to either not hunt or clean it up. <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON> has maintained that such advisories are routine. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> has said that he does not use the property for hunting, but that he does feed ducks occasionally. <PERSON> Dunkle </PERSON> at the time said <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> asked him to keep him advised if people broke the law on his property.

 Two men in custody Friday in the 1981 kidnapping and killing of an 11-year-old girl, were linked to the crime by a third man who confessed in a letter mailed after his death, police said. <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was last seen getting into a car on Aug. 31, 1981. Her disappearance set off a widespread search in the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> area, but no trace of her was found until her body was found in a field six months later. Police had been unable to come up with any clues in the case since then. On Dec. 16, a man named <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> died in an automobile accident in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and his brother complied with his request to mail a sealed letter to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> police. The letter confessed to <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s involvement in <PERSON> Christine </PERSON>'s disappearance and death, and linked two other men to the case, police said `` I would imagine throughout the years -LRB- <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s -RRB- conscience was bothering him,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Carney </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's homicide unit. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, was arrested on Monday and is being held in the <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 29, was arrested on Thursday in <LOCATION> Kinnelon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, police said. They were charged with kidnapping and first-degree murder. `` There was no inkling at all that these people had anything to do with'' <PERSON> Christine </PERSON>'s death, said <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Ott </PERSON> <PERSON> Cefkin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s letter said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> picked up <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> and took her to his mobile home, where she was sedated and apparently raped numerous times, according to a court document. Questioned by detectives, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> admitted to picking up the girl, taking her to the trailer where he lived with <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> to have sex with her, but said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> killed her, sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said that he gave <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> several drinks and that <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> gave her pills, the arrest warrant says. The letter said the girl was suffocated and her body was dumped. The letter was given to police in January but they would not release its contents on Thursday. <PERSON> Christine </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, said she has continued to think about her daughter, but tried to live a normal life. `` I wondered, always about the details and how many people'' were involved, she said. `` I think knowing will help a little bit. It will help to know that two others -LRB- the suspects -RRB- will be sweating it out.''

 Investors soon may be offered the chance to buy into the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's savings and loan bailout plan, but will the $ 50 billion in bonds proposed to fund the program be a wise investment? `` It's a fairly secure security,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Stone, a senior economist at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. She said she thinks the bonds will be attractive to investors But <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lakefield </PERSON>, an executive vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was more skeptical. `` I do n't think enough information is out in the marketplace at the present time to get a good feel,'' he said last week. `` We have n't gone through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. We're just speculating on the way it was presented along the way.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan envisions another new government agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> REFCO </ORGANIZATION>, to be set up to float the $ 50 billion in 30-year bonds over three years. Proceeds from the securities would be added to other government monies to rescue or close ailing thrifts, which make up about a third of the nation's 3,100 S & amp; Ls The principal on the bonds would be repaid through increased insurance premiums paid by the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry. Most of the interest payments on the bonds are expected to come from taxpayer money. It's expected that <ORGANIZATION> REFCO </ORGANIZATION> would buy zero-coupon <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds in the open market to collateralize the $ 50 billion debt. Analysts said there's no doubt the <ORGANIZATION> REFCO </ORGANIZATION> bonds will be safe but how attractive their yields will be remains to be seen. `` They're intangibles that are very difficult to quantify at this point,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brachfeld </PERSON>, an executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last month that he expeced the REFCO bonds to be traded at a premium of about a quarter of a percentage point over 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, which are now yielding around 9.15 percent But <PERSON> Lakefield </PERSON> said he expected the premium to be slightly higher, as is the case with other agency bonds. He noted that a bond the government issues to back military loans to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is about a third of a percentage point over comparable Treasuries. Government agencies have been issuing bonds over the years to finance anything from farm loans to home mortgages. Although they're backed by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, they are not considered direct obligations, and that's why their yields are slightly higher than Treasuries Ms. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> REFCO </ORGANIZATION> bonds would appeal to `` almost anybody who is interested in a long-term investment,'' such as retirees, pension funds and life insurance companies <PERSON> Lakefield </PERSON> predicted the market would easily absorb them despite the large volume. `` The marketplace is a big, international marketplace,'' he said. Under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan, $ 10 billion of the bonds would be sold in fiscal 1989, $ 25 billion in fiscal 1990 and $ 15 billion in fiscal 1991.

<HEAD>Bulls Storm Back To Copper Market</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: An ADD with weekly price trends will follow later in the cycle.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The copper bulls are at it again, buying up copper futures, driving up prices and talking up the possibility of new record highs in a market that is proving to be as resilient as it is volatile. Some of the recent developments supporting the current rally, such as labor strife in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and shipping problems in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, are familiar to those who have followed copper on its mostly upward course during the past two years. Other factors _ the fear of AIDS in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, for example _ have not been widely cited before. But underpinning the gains are the same basic circumstances that prompted copper's runup from around 65 cents a pound in the spring of 1987 to the record high of $ 1.6475 a pound set last Dec. 8 on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange: strong demand and tight supplies. The supply tightness appeared to be easing earlier this year following the settlement in mid-December of a 57-day miners' strike in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, the world's sixth-largest copper producer. A subsequent increase in supplies of copper deliverable against <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> contracts contributed to a selloff that dropped the price of spot copper on the exchange to $ 1.257 a pound by Valentine's Day. But world demand for copper remained strong, a function of the economic growth of industrialized nations. Then shipping difficulties resurfaced in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, respectively the world's fourth - and seventh-largest copper producers, sparking new waves of speculative buying The rally continued in the past week on fears of another extended strike in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> after miners there called for a 3-day work stoppage, beginning March 26, to protest management's failure to comply with the terms of the December agreement. Copper for spot delivery on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> jumped 5.6 cents Friday amid persistent supply concerns to $ 1.53 a pound. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Demler </PERSON>, metals economist with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the copper market looks strong on all fronts. `` The consumption numbers show very strong growth, the fundamentals look good, the technical signals look good, physical stocks are low _ it's beginning to look like a replay of 1987 and 1988,'' he said. The shortage of copper was underscored by the small amount of copper available for delivery against the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> contract due to expire on March 29. As of the beginning of trading on Friday, exchange inventories of deliverable copper totaled 17,446 tons. Open interest in the March contract _ the number of contracts still to be settled by either an offsetting trade or physical delivery _ was 9,427 contracts, the equivalent of 117,838 tons. The vast majority of futures contracts are settled by offsetting trades, not physical delivery, but analysts say the unusually wide imbalance is one indication of extreme supply tightness. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> produce nearly 30 percent of the world's refined copper but much of the remainder comes from <LOCATION> Third </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION> countries where political upheavals, labor disputes, terrorist bombings, crumbling transportation systems and equipment malfunctions occasionally disrupt mining and refinery operations. The frequency of such interruptions seems to have increased along with the demand for and price of copper. During the past year, major disruptions occurred in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, all major copper producers. Market analyst <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Anagnos </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> contends African production also has been hampered by the flight of mining engineers from the continent due to fear of AIDS. The deadly disease has spread rapidly in some part of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Concerns over the disease are particularly prevalent among the Europeans, primarily Belgian engineers who have been hired to operate the mines in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Anagnos </PERSON> wrote in a recent report. `` The decision by many of the engineers to leave the nation has exacerbated prevailing diplomatic problems between <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> -LRB- formerly a Belgian colony -RRB- and resulted in supply losses.'' The AIDS angle may seem trivial but it does n't take much to move a market made nervous by supply tightness. `` Given the right conditions, you could see new highs,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` A lot of things are possible in a market like this.''

<HEAD>Consumers Focus On Price, Service In `Overstored' America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For every man, woman and child in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, there are 15 square feet of retail space in shopping centers and malls. Count the area in neighborhood stores and the figure becomes even bigger. The relentless development of new shopping sites probably will ease as the baby-boom bulge of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population grows older, but it still continues. Too many of the stores springing up are the same, lacking the flare they'd need to stand out in an overpopulated retail landscape, analysts say. And not enough stores that supply do-it-yourself household gear or cater to the needs of older people are being built, contrary to what demographic trends indicate are needed, they note. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sack </PERSON>, a retailing analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, says the nation's big retailers went on an expansion binge in the 1960s and'70s, boosting growth by opening more and more stores. `` Growth no longer works'' as a way of winning market share, says Sack, who came up with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> per capita estimate of retail space using figures from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shopping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION>. Price is the highest priority for many consumers when choosing where to shop. Service also is important, but probably less so. The success of discounters that are threatening to topple <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> from the head of the retail league table, such as <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, illustrates the significance consumers attach to finding what they feel are fair prices. Periodic markdowns, even drastic ones, are n't a guarantee of gaining a faithful customer following, either. `` Sales do n't work anymore,'' Sack says. `` Nobody pays full price for things anymore and a lot of stores have lost credibility by announcing sales and then not having the goods available, so they have to give rain checks.'' Promising a `` sale that never ends,'' <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> opened its doors on a new low-price policy this past week. Advertising on television, radio and in newspapers dramatized the unprecedented shift in strategy by the retailer, which now is in its second century of operation. The retailing giant shut down all of its stores across the country for 42 hours to mobilize thousands of workers to slash price tags on 50,000 items. When the more than 800 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Roebuck </PERSON> stores across the country reopened at noon Wednesday, customers flocked in to see for themselves what the hoopla was about. As human nature would have it, some were thrilled by the bargains, others were n't. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> hopes to keep them coming back by pursuing an `` everyday low prices'' policy. It has vowed to meet competitors' prices; if customers bring in another store's advertisement with a lower price than <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> has on an identical item, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> will match it. Supervisors have been ordered to shop at rival retailers to determine what they are charging. It wo n't be clear for months whether <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' ideas for maintaining its pre-eminent position in the retail industry is working. Shoppers, even more cost-conscious now that interest rates are on the rise, will cast the deciding vote. `` The consumer is very smart,'' says Sack. `` They'll decide whether they really feel if they're getting good value.'' In other business this past week: _ <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, manufacturer of the solid rocket motors for the Challenger space shuttle, which exploded after liftoff Jan. 28, 1986 killing seven astronauts, announced a major realignment Its thriving specialty chemicals business, including the <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> salt business, will be spun off from its troubled aerospace operation. _ <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> snuffed out its `` smokeless'' cigarette after spending millions of dollars during almost a decade of research. The company said it was pulling the controversial cigarette off store shelves, ending five-month trials in test markets. The Premier brand was condemned to death partly because smokers said it tasted terrible. _ A series of reports suggested the economy remains strong but rising interest rates may be affecting consumer spending The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, the government's chief gauge of future economic activity, went up a healthy 0.6 percent in January. Another department report said personal income gained 1.8 percent in January, while growth in personal consumption expenditures slowed to 0.1 percent.

<HEAD>Economic Slowdown Slow In Coming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It has been a long wait for Wall Streeters looking for signs of a much-predicted slowdown in the economy. The script written by most bulls on the stock market for 1989 called for business activity to cool off, allowing interest rates to top out and turn downward. That, in turn, would ease the competitive pressure on the stock market that comes from virtually riskless money-market securities such as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills yielding close to 9 percent. But approaching the end of the first quarter of the year, there is little evidence at hand that the economy is yielding to credit-tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. On Friday, for example, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the index of leading economic indicators rose 0.6 percent in January after posting a 0.7 percent increase the month before. If a slackening of growth is in the offing, it has n't shown up yet in that statistical early-warning system. But many adherents to the `` slowdown'' view still insist the picture is likely to change before long. `` We will soon see softer economic numbers and a peaking of rates,'' declares <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There is a myth that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has not been tough enough. Two years ago the prime rate was resting at 7 -LCB- percent. Now it is 11 -LCB- percent. That's 400 basis points, or an increase of over 50 percent. `` There should be little doubt that a double-digit prime, coupled with double-digit mortgage rates, will be reflected in economic activity.'' <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> stepped up its credit-tightening in November after it concluded that growth had been restrained to some extent, but not enough to satisfy the central bank's inflation-fighting goals. `` Given lags between changes in monetary policy and the ultimate effects on the economy, it was too soon to expect the recent crop of January economic statistics to show very much effect from the tightening since November,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> stated. `` However, because tightening ` worked' last year, it should do so again.'' Hopes on that score helped the stock market achieve some grudging gains in the past week, recouping some of the previous week's steep losses. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 28.75 to 2,274.29, rebounding from a 79.28-point drop the week before. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index gained 2.18 to 163.90; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market added 4.03 to 403.99, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was up 4.73 at 326.22. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 155.66 million shares a day, against 154.03 million in the preceding week. Some observers, of course, worry not that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been too cautious but that it has gone too far, setting the economy on course for a recession. In the view of <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, there are good reasons to worry about inflation. `` Inflation rates are likely to strengthen, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> policy should remain taut, and interest rates may back up further,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` By midyear, the economy should begin to slow and the rate of inflation should begin to recede. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has not tightened enough to cause a recession, although the risk that they will, over the near term, should be taken seriously.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Gibraltar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's 10 biggest savings and loan companies, revealed Friday it had agreed with federal regulators to restrict its activities in hopes of stemming continued losses. The company also said it would require a substantial investment from outside or a merger to maintain federally required capital levels. The company, parent of the 86-branch <ORGANIZATION> Gibraltar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Loan, with assets of $ 15 billion, has been losing money since late 1987, and recently disclosed it expected 1988 losses to reach $ 71 million to $ 76 million. Additionally, profit in the first quarter of 1989 will be cut by a $ 20 million writeoff from the closing of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> MoneyCenter, which makes loans out of state, the company said in a news release. That closure is part of the supervisory agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the company said. The supervisory agreement had been expected since January, when the company revealed that federal regulators had declared <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> to be in `` unsafe and unsound'' condition. That finding was made despite the fact <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> met federal capital requirements, which govern how much cash the company must have available to back its loans. The agreement with regulators restricts <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> to making home loans in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, the company said. A previous agreement to restrict growth remains in effect. `` It is evident we will be unable to maintain required capital levels without a merger with or major investment by a third party,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thayer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> chairman, president and chief executive officer, said in a news release. `` Any such transaction will require significant <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> assistance ... There is no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts.'' <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> started on its slide with losses on real estate loans. Recently, it has been hurt by rising interest rates, which force it to pay more to attract deposits than it earns in interest on fixed-rate loans it made in the past.

 The government released more data pointing to continued strength in the economy, with reports that its key economic forecasting gauge rose sharply in January and that factory orders were strong that month except for a fallback in transportation equipment. But neither report, released on Friday, had a major effect on the financial markets. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.58 to 2,274.29. Bond prices were narrowly mixed, while the dollar declined against most major currencies. Meanwhile, the nation's Big Three automakers reported Friday that car and truck sales fell 17.9 percent in February compared with the same period last year. U.S.-made cars sold by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sold at an average daily rate of 26,062 during the period this year. That compares with an average of 32,297 cars sold daily during the same period last year. Sales of light trucks averaged 15,561 a day in late February, compared with a daily rate of 18,419 during the same time last year. January's 0.6 percent rise in the <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indicators </ORGANIZATION> followed a 0.7 percent increase in December and provided fresh evidence that 1989 opened on a strong note despite widespread expectations of an impending slowdown. The index, designed to foretell economic activity six to nine months into the future, was up and down during much of last year. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said January's rise in the index `` shows a moderate level of growth which we believe is conducive to a healthy economy.'' However, analysts cautioned that the latest signs of robust economic activity could heighten concerns that the economy is speeding ahead too quickly to contain inflationary pressures. That, they said, could increase the risk of a recession by causing the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to act too aggressively as it pushes up interest rates to slow the economy and restrain inflation. `` I think there is a risk that we'll overreact to the data and push ourselves into a recession in the latter part of this year or in 1990,'' said economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a forecasting firm in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. A second report Friday from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offered additional evidence of strength in the economy Although orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods were down 1.3 percent in January, the decrease was attributed to a fallback in demand for transportation equipment from record levels set in December. Excluding transportation, factory orders were up 0.2 percent during January. And orders in the key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a good barometer of industry investment plans, were up 1.6 percent in January.
