 A leading renegade military officer sought in coup plots against President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was arrested early hursday as he left a restaurant in a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> suburb, officials said. Former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Reynaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabauatan </PERSON>, wearing civilian clothes and a disguise of eyeglasses and a goatee, was unarmed when military agents took him into custody in <LOCATION> Pasay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> shortly after midnight, according to Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Pantaleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumlao </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dumlao </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cabauatan </PERSON> tried to get away and urged officers to shoot him. But he stopped when one of them placed a gun to his head and threatened to shoot, <PERSON> Dumlao </PERSON> added. He said earlier that <PERSON> Cabauatan </PERSON> offered no resistance. Cabauatan's brother, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>, and a friend were detained with him outside the <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> restaurant but were released, officials said. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> praised the military for the capture and told reporters the arrest `` will lead to greater stability in this country.'' <PERSON> Dumlao </PERSON> said agents surrounded the restaurant and waited outside for five hours for Cabauatan to leave after getting a tip he was at a party there. He said they were not certain it was Cabauatan because of his disguise, so agents approached him and saluted. <PERSON> Dumlao </PERSON> said they grabbed <PERSON> Cabauatan </PERSON> when the former colonel returned the salute. <PERSON> Dumlao </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cabauatan </PERSON>, a former Philippine Constabulary officer, was taken to Constabulary headquarters at Camp Crame for interrogation. He said <PERSON> Cabauatan </PERSON> faced three possible criminal charges, but he did not specify the charges. <PERSON> Cabauatan </PERSON> was the most prominent anti-Aquino military figure seized since the December 1987 capture of former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, leader of an Aug. 28, 1987, coup attempt that left at least 53 people dead. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> escaped last April from a prison ship in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and remains at large. <PERSON> Cabauatan </PERSON> was sought after a January 1987 coup attempt, when renegade soldiers stormed military and news media facilities in the capital. The government called it an attempt to restore ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to power. <PERSON> Cabauatan </PERSON> also took part in an abortive putsch at The <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Hotel in July 1986 and was believed to have been linked to an attack on the stockade at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bonifacio </LOCATION> in April 1987. Cabauatan went underground and was later dropped from military rolls as absent without leave. In statements to reporters, he claimed to have organized the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to continue his struggle against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Montano </PERSON>, commander of the Philippine Constabulary, told reporters Thursday there were `` very strong indications that the money being used by this group came from ex-President <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>.'' He did not elaborate. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> identified <PERSON> Cabauatan </PERSON> as one of the major military figures sought in armed attempts against the president. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, a right-wing lawyer, said he spoke by telephone with <PERSON> Cabauatan </PERSON> minutes after his arrest and said <PERSON> Cabauatan </PERSON> `` will cooperate so the truth will come out.'' <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cabauatan </PERSON> opposed violent attempts to overthrow the government but sought change `` through peaceful, democratic and legal means.'' He said <PERSON> Cabauatan </PERSON> supported a campaign by former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Abadilla </PERSON> to forge `` genuine reconciliation'' between Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return from exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where he fled after a popular uprising toppled his administration three years ago. <PERSON> Abadilla </PERSON>, former intelligence chief of the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> area, was also charged in the January 1987 coup attempt but was acquitted by a military court in December. In another development, a relative of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> charged Wednesday that an American consulting firm was hired by Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> to undermine the government. But a spokesman for the company, <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, Stone and <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said it was simply helping the opposition organize a political party before the 1992 presidential election. During a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Emigdio </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanjuatco </PERSON>, said the company `` monitored activity in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and in the executive branch relevant to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>'' as part of an effort by <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> to discredit the government. Laurel broke with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> last year and announced he was organizing an opposition movement.

<TEXT>
 Ex-President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokomanu </PERSON> was sentenced Tuesday to six years in jail after being convicted of trying to install his nephew as prime minister of this <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island chain. <PERSON> Sokomanu </PERSON>, who has been president since 1980, was dismissed from office in January for plotting against Prime Minister <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lini </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sokomanu </PERSON>'s nephew, <PERSON> Barak </PERSON> <PERSON> Sope </PERSON>, and opposition leader <PERSON> Maxime </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlot </PERSON> were given five-year prison sentences and former member of Parliament <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> was sentenced to two years. The charges against <PERSON> Sokomanu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sope </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carlot </PERSON> carried maximum sentences of life imprisonment. Three defendants were acquitted. <PERSON> Sokomanu </PERSON> was convicted of inciting mutiny within <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>'s paramilitary forces last December in an attempt to replace <PERSON> Lini </PERSON>'s elected government with an interim administration headed by Sokomanu and the other defendants were taken into police custody just before Christmas. At the time of of his arrest <PERSON> Sokomanu </PERSON> acknowledged his action was unconstitutional, but he said <PERSON> Lini </PERSON> was unable to govern after suffering a stroke. He said he tried to install <PERSON> Sope </PERSON> as prime minister to restore economic power. <PERSON> Sope </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lini </PERSON> had been engaged in a power struggle for more than a year. Acquitted by British-born Judge <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> were former member of Parliament <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Naupa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sokomanu </PERSON>'s private secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalititi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Spooner </PERSON>. Those three and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> had been charged with lesser counts of conspiracy to overthrow the government and with administering and making unlawful oaths and statements at a Dec. 18 swearing-in ceremony. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> was brought in from the <LOCATION> Solomon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> to hear the most controversial case in <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>'s brief history and to pass judgment. His decisions are subject to appeal. <PERSON> Sokomanu </PERSON> was removed from office in January by the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> which accused him of gross misconduct. <PERSON> Sokomanu </PERSON> had served as head of state and <PERSON> Lini </PERSON> as head of government since <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION> became independent in July 1980. <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>, formerly the Anglo-French <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hebrides </LOCATION>, had been jointly administered by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> since 1906.

<TEXT>
 In 1980, 50 stand-up comics tried their luck on `` Audition Night'' at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Improv. Two were <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivory </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON>. They quickly became friends and ended up co-writing `` Hollywood Shuffle,'' a film largely financed by <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>'s credit cards that turned into one of last season's surprise movie hits Now <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON> is showcasing his own talents by writing, directing and starring in `` I'm Gon na to Git You Sucka,'' a takeoff on the `` blaxploitation'' films of the 1970s. `` A few years ago, me and some friends were sitting around and talking about the movies we used to go see,'' <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` The conversation went from, ` remember this movie' to ` remember this scene.' We started laughing and that was when ` Airplane' was coming out and that was kind of a blueprint for me.'' Starting with the death of <PERSON> Junebug </PERSON> <PERSON> Spade </PERSON> from an overdose of gold chains -LRB- `` He was ready to die!'' the preacher boomed -RRB-, `` I'm Gon na to Git You Sucka'' takes on such movies as `` Superfly'' and `` Shaft'' and turns them upside down. <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON>, who also co-wrote and co-produced the <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> concert film, `` Raw,'' plays <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Spade </PERSON>, who helps capture those responsible for his brother <PERSON> Junebug </PERSON>'s death. Assisting <PERSON> Spade </PERSON> are an aging band of tough guys played by ex-football stars <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and musician <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, who wrote the theme to `` Shaft.'' `` That was the coolest thing,'' <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON> said. `` To be able to work with those guys and then to watch them get up there and be totally uninhibited. That's because they got it. They did n't take themselves seriously. They were having a good time. In retrospect, they could see where the humor was.'' Fans of `` National Lampoon's <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'' will recognize <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>, the dreaded <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Wermer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Faber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> is the villain again in `` I'm Going to Git You Sucka.'' He plays Mr. Big, the man behind the proliferation of gold chains. `` My first choice was <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON> said. `` Initially, it was still going to be ` Mr.' Big but you would n't have ever seen her face.'' <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON>' project took a long time to get to the screen. When the film was conceived in the early 1980s, he was a relatively unknown stand-up comic and actor. It was a time when <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> studios were not interested in financing an all black film. They were, however, willing to reconsider if Wynans would agree to make a few `` minor'' changes. `` I went to <ORGANIZATION> Vestron </ORGANIZATION> and they kept coming up with the most bizarre ways to integrate the cast they could think of. ` How about if I get <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> -LRB- ` The Breakfast Club,' ` Sixteen Candles' -RRB- to be my younger brother _ a kid that was left on the doorstep of my house and act black for the entire film?' `` ` And how about if we make one of the guys like <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON>.' They wanted so desperately to integrate it they did n't care if they undermined the picture.'' But the success of `` Hollywood Shuffle'' and <PERSON> Spike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s `` She's Got ta Have It'' made the studios more receptive to <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON>' project and he ended up getting <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> to distribute the film `` It was a lot easier to go in and sit down and really talk. Before we did ` Hollywood Shuffle,' if it was an all black act, no one wanted to touch it.'' <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON> grew up in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, one of 10 children. He was trying to make people laugh as far back as he could remember and had plenty of time to display his talents at the family dinner table. `` There was always an audience and we were always competing,'' he said. `` Dinner time was sitting at a long table with my parents at each end. The objective was making the person across from you spit food.'' His early heros were <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> and the late <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Prinze </PERSON>, who also grew up in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>. But while those comedians had traumatic and tragic lives -LRB- <PERSON> Prinze </PERSON> committed suicide just as he became a star -RRB-, <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON> has no interest in being a `` tortured artist,'' `` It was n't a psychological thing where I had a horrible family life and I wanted the audience to love me,'' he said. `` There are those who just find humor in almost anything, who have warped senses of humor, which I'm a victim of. I just find everything funny and I like being funny.'' Although Mr. <PERSON> Big </PERSON> mutters ominously at the end of the movie that `` there will be no sequel,'' <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON> is anxious to continue making films and also to help other blacks break into the business. `` The recognized pool of talent is so small that the opportunity is tremendous,'' said <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON>, who found roles for <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fargas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Damon </PERSON> among others. `` There's a building pool of talent right now.'' But <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON> could n't help adding, `` I used them all in the movie.''

<TEXT>
 The Court of Appeals on Tuesday overturned a murder conviction because sheriff's deputies were allowed to wear rubber gloves in court to protect them in case the defendant was infected with the AIDS virus. The opinion by Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said it was likely the sight of deputies sitting behind <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> wearing gloves led jurors to believe he had AIDS and should be `` withdrawn from public circulation and confined in an institution with others of his ilk.'' `` The specter of the dread disease AIDS hovered over the trial,'' <PERSON> Orth </PERSON> said in the unanimous ruling by the seven-member court. `` The trial judge refused to exorcise it'' despite `` <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>' persistent and vehement protests.'' The court returned the case to Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> for a new trial. <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> was convicted in November 1987 of the murder of <PERSON> Bjorn </PERSON> <PERSON> Haug </PERSON>, whom he had met at a bar in his hometown of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He is in the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. According to trial testimony, <PERSON> Haug </PERSON> returned to <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>' apartment, where he was knocked unconscious and loaded into the trunk of a car by <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> and three friends The group drove into <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Haug </PERSON>, who had regained consciousness, was killed by <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, according to testimony. Prosecutors told Judge <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> that <PERSON> Haug </PERSON> had been diagnosed as having AIDS, that a codefendant and roommate of <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> carried the AIDS virus and that <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> and his roommate were homosexual. Although <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> had not been tested for the virus, <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said there was `` a strong possibility or probability'' that he had it, and denied a motion by defense attorneys that the guards not be allowed to sit behind <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> while wearing gloves. The appeals court also ruled Tuesday that <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> should have granted a defense motion not to admit items stolen from <PERSON> Haug </PERSON>'s apartment that were found in <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>' apartment because they were not listed in a search warrant

 Tell <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> the date you were born and he'll immediately give you the day of the week you first drew breath. Same with dates in the future. He's a human calendar. Yet it's only weeks since the 19-year-old autistic savant mastered buttoning his own clothes, allowing him to trade elastic-waisted trousers for his first button-up <PERSON> Levis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> will graduate June 2 from a special education program that has taught him the joy of work in an alien world. By the time he earns his diploma, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> hopes to have found a life's work in numbers. A recent issue of the <ORGANIZATION> Viewmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> newspaper dubbed <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> the school's `` Rain Man.'' He shares many traits with the movie's title character, but there are important differences <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>'s calendar calculations and aptitude for figures do n't make him a prodigious savant like <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. But unlike <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>'s mania for numbers and improving social skills let him hold down a job. They loved him in trials at a video store and the school library. Tests show <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> to be mildly retarded as well as autistic and a savant, a mix that puts his promising quest for work in a post office or city library on a very uncrowded plane. `` They are usually so incapacitated in other ways that their skill wo n't help them,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritvo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, one of the country's leading authorities on autism. Indeed, those who knew <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> when he was younger are surprised at his blossoming sociability. Greetings in the corridors are returned with a not-so-nervous `` Hi,'' and he has somewhat relaxed the obsessive routines and rituals that govern an autistic life. `` I was worried because I had heard that they got worse as they got into adolescence and families had to decide what to do with them. With <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> just the opposite happened. He just seemed to improve,'' said <PERSON> Candace </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, his mother. `` He's just a huge success story for parents with autistic kids who normally feel isolated, frustrated and believe ... it's a burden that will never let up,'' said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>'s special education teacher. Years ago, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s first autistic student spoke only in the second-person and was prone to unpredictable rages that injured herself and others. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>, her third autistic pupil, is the first savant and the only one to shine at the community vocational opportunities <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> arranges. `` I think he's trying to understand people's feelings,'' she said. `` It's a very rote process, a very mechanical process.'' Autism, absorption in self-centered, subjective mental activity, is a severe disorder present in four of 10,000 births, an overwhelming majority of them males. Its cause is unknown, but evidence suggests chemical or structural abnormalities in the brain. Among its characteristics is a profound disability in forming normal human attachments, or in showing or receiving affection. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> stiffens up when hugged, even by his parents, and wo n't let on if he's sick or in pain. A study by <PERSON> Ritvo </PERSON> and others published in February's <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatry </ORGANIZATION> shows about two-thirds of those with autism have some degree of mental retardation, scoring below 70 on standardized IQ tests. Only about 10 percent of autistic people fall into the savant category, and far fewer of those are mentally retarded, other studies show. Mrs. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> believes her son, who hoards bus schedules and loves to read the phone books he gets at Christmas, performs his calendar gymnastics by visual rather than mathematical means. `` I used to wonder if he was calculating dates, but I really believe it's a matter of having a photograph in his mind of our 100-year calendar. I asked him dates in the 1800s the other day and he could n't do it,'' she said. That's <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>'s explanation, too, elicited in what is typically a one-sided conversation with a stranger. He nervously checks his watch every few seconds. How do you figure out what day somebody was born? `` I have a good memory.'' What do you want to do after graduation? `` Have a job.'' Something with numbers? `` Yes.'' He's a whiz at simple math and his memory for numbers is as convenient as it is vast. `` He makes a great phone directory,'' says brother <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>. `` I think about anything he sees he's likely to remember,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who spent hours a few years ago making flash cards of multiplication tables, only to have <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> render them useless by memorizing the answers the first time through. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, manager of <LOCATION> Video </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> in this <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suburb, accepted <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> for an hour a day's training on a two-week trial basis. He stayed for 1 -LCB- years, quickly memorizing the shelf code for every videocassette in the store and eventually mastering the computer to check in movies. `` He was amazing with numbers,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. But it took him six months to routinely talk to other employees and much longer to pass time with customers. `` I used to stand by the door and say, ` <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>, you ca n't leave until you say goodbye to everybody.' He would finally mumble goodbye.'' `` The emotional connection is the last to be made by an autistic child,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` It's so difficult to make people understand the excitement you feel when they finally start making that connection.'' An earlier stint shelving books at the school library gave <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> command of the Dewey Decimal System and friendship with the once-skeptical librarian. He was far less avid about custodial and landscaping jobs, and <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> believes absence of social interaction as much as numbers accounts for that today. `` He reaches out to people. His social habits are much more appropriate,'' she said, citing <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>'s response to the death of a school administrator's wife. As expected, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> affably recapitulated for the bereaved husband the obituary information from the newspaper. But then he added, `` I'm so sorry about your wife.''

 Former pop singer <PERSON> Cat </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> reiterated his support for the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death sentence against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, saying the author's treatment of Islam was `` as good as stabbing Moslems in the heart.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who changed his name to <PERSON> Yusuf </PERSON> <PERSON> Islam </PERSON> when he became a Moslem in 1979, said Tuesday that threatening to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> was the equivalent of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> using an atomic bomb. `` It's got to be seen as a deterrent, so that other people should not commit the same mistake again,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said in an interview with the television show `` World Monitor,'' produced by The Christian Science Monitor. Last week, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> denied endorsing the death sentence after his statements received harsh criticism in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel `` The Satanic Verses'' has generated worldwide outrage among Moslems and support for the Moslem author in the West In Tuesday's interview, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> also said negative reaction in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to his comments is a bit ironic, considering his former record company recently refused his request to stop producing his records. `` All I can see is that God works in mysterious ways,'' said <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who was interviewed from a mosque near <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where he lives. `` Some of my records are being destroyed.'' Several radio stations have refused to play <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' records because of his earlier remarks. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> station offered copies of `` The Satanic Verses'' to people who brought their <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' records to the station. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who said the novel's treatment of Islam was `` as good as stabbing Moslems in the heart,'' suggested that <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> should repent writing the book. `` If he manages to escape -LRB- the death sentence -RRB- he still has to face God on the day of judgment,'' he said. `` So I would recommend to him to sincerely change his ways right now.''

 <PERSON> Shellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> begs for money in the subway, gets valium from a friend and sometimes spends the night with other teen-agers on a littered sidewalk by the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION>. At 17, she is one of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s army of homeless youths whose numbers, critics of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> claim, are being swollen by the Conservative government's radical shakeup of the welfare system. The government is determined to wean Britons off what it calls `` the dependency culture.'' To do this, it is paying 16 - and 17-year-old high school dropouts $ 50 - $ 60 a week to become job trainees and cutting off welfare payments to those who do n't sign More than 400,000 now work for their benefits each year and gain job experience in the process. But those who do n't register for a one - or two-year `` YTS,'' or Youth Training Scheme, have been barred since Sept. 12 from `` signing on'' for $ 33 a week in state aid Exemptions are available to youths who suffer `` severe hardship'' such as disability or a violent home, and of 4,500 applications for hardship status, nearly 3,000 have been accepted. But critics, including some members of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s own <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, have forced an acknowledgment from Social Security Minister <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> that the reform is causing problems, and he has hinted he will broaden his discretionary powers to help those worst hit. Conservative lawmaker <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Squire </PERSON> supports this Thatcherite concept of `` workfare,'' but opposes cutting welfare payments. `` People who have no real home should be properly looked after until they are able to get a job or a YTS course,'' he says. Their only alternatives are to `` either resort to crime or to begging gifts or to prostitution,'' he said in an interview. Some see the issue as a test of how far Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s crusade can go in revamping the 43-year-old welfare system. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, who runs the New Horizon day hostel near Covent Garden in the heart of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said young homeless often regard job training as `` slave labor. They do n't think they should be forced to do it.'' Many come from unemployment-stricken northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, or are fleeing broken homes, and can not afford accommodation. The YTS has 135,000 unfilled places, yet some youngsters have difficulty finding the right slot, and others get fired because they do n't get on with their employers. `` There's no transition,'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. `` Either it works or it does n't work ... Any other way you can think of to make money, they do it. Most cope very well. Of course, some go under.'' <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, stepping out of the rain to meet friends in the hostel's dingy pool room, said she left home in September because `` me and me dad did n't get on. She say she has since slept in doorways, under railroad bridges and on sidewalks in the so-called `` cardboard city'' along the <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION>. Lately, she has found shelter in an abandoned house in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. She says she gave up a trainee mechanic job after four days because `` it was too underpaid and it was n't worth it.'' She says she can earn up to $ 50 a day begging in subway stations. `` I'm better off how I am now than I was when I was living at home,'' <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said, her voice wavering. `` There ai n't no one telling me what I should do.'' Her eyes are unsteady; her face flashes a smile, then becomes a grimace. `` People who are homeless now are all like brother and sister,'' she said. `` All they're worried about is when is their next money going to come to buy food, if they've got enough blankets, if it's going to rain tonight. Drugs and violence are endemic. Illnesses such as scurvy, scabies and tuberculosis are common. The government says <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> has 23,000 homeless, but welfare groups say the total is closer to 40,000 and growing. Last year, the government ended housing subsidies for nearly 1 million poor. Grants for buying stoves and beds were changed to interest-free loans. Unemployed people under age 25 now are allowed only two to six weeks welfare if they remain in the same region. The government allocated $ 36 million last summer to help <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> authorities renovate empty public housing and pay for homeless hostels. New Horizon still must raise $ 128,000 in voluntary aid this year. `` We're professional beggars,'' jokes <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, 17, from <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, said he was forced off the dole into becoming a trainee decorator, but his job consisted mainly of running errands. He quit in frustration. `` You try to sleep in toilets or park benches,'' he said. `` There's nowhere warm. You're shaking all night and all the next day you're shaking. Your stomach's empty. You feel dead weak.'' He now earns $ 182 a week working in a grocery store, and is moving into a working men's club where the weekly rent is $ 107. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> did me good really _ she made me find work,'' said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, a gaunt figure with spiked hair. `` People who've got something in them, they're going to benefit out of this,'' he said. `` But for every one person that does get a job, 10 people will go homeless and go on the streets.''

 An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> chef says Soviet authorities have given him approval to set up a kosher restaurant in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadosh </PERSON> said Tuesday that he discussed the idea last week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with city officials and tourism and trade representatives. `` The Soviets are showing a great readiness to help us create the restaurant as quickly as possible,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, though they have imposed `` some limitations on the signs'' of the future restaurant. The Israeli daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> said the eatery will be funded by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> activists and its prices will be subsidized. Kadosh, chef at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s Sheraton-Plaza Hotel, said the menu would be based on Israeli cuisine and that some products would be imported from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He said the kosher certificate will be given by the chief rabbi of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kadosh </PERSON> said he plans to travel to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the near future to help organize the restaurant and will supervise it through short visits. `` The aim is not making profit but creating a kosher food place for Jews and tourists,'' <PERSON> Kadosh </PERSON> said. `` My best profit would be a contribution to the <LOCATION> Soviet-Israeli </LOCATION> ties.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> cut ties with the Jewish state following the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war.

 Five thousand police officers lined bitterly cold streets outside a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> church Tuesday for the funeral of the first <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> police officer killed on duty in the city this year. Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Machate </PERSON> was shot to death March 3 while struggling with a suspect in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>.

 As national elections move closer, the biggest bloc of voters remains undecided, despite months of feverish campaigning by the main presidential contenders. Analysts say the undecided voters are mainly supporters of President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> angry at five years of economic stagnation and social unrest; Peronists unhappy with their party's candidate, the center-right <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>; and center-left voters who feel none of the candidates speak for them. `` I do n't feel represented by any of them,'' said <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dardalla </PERSON> <PERSON> Rute </PERSON>, 33, the owner of a small public relations company. `` None of them will make a good president.'' Real estate agent <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Reymann </PERSON>, 25, voted for <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> in 1983 but has been disappointed and would rather not vote for a Radical in these elections, set for May 14. But at the same time, she would never vote Peronist or socialist and does n't think a conservative could win. `` I'm not uninformed,'' Miss <PERSON> Reymann </PERSON> said. `` I read the papers. I listen to the radio.'' But no candidate stands out, she said, and the ballot she casts _ voting is mandatory in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> _ may be blank. At state in the elections are the presidency, some <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats, half the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, and provincial legislatures. Three surveys conducted over the past two months have put undecided voters at 39 percent, 32 percent and 32.5 percent. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> is 7 to 10 points ahead of the Radicals' <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> in those polls and others, but the gap has narrowed considerably. <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsogaray </PERSON> of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> trails a distant third, followed by <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION>. Under the constitution, <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> can not seek a second consecutive term. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> and <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>, both provincial governors and lawyers, have traversed the country and made the requisite swing through <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to demonstrate their statesmenship abilities. Positions have been staked out on how to restart the economy, balance the budget, curtail urban crime, provide housing, pay the foreign debt, and ease relations between the military and human rights groups. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, 53, and <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>, 57, are both center-right, but their parties are movements that defy political labeling. Their parties, along with the armed forces, have provided <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s presidents for most of this century. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> has tried to play down the <ORGANIZATION> Peronists </ORGANIZATION>' `` black legend'' of violence and administrative incompetence, which preceded military coups in 1955 and 1976. The latter has tried to distance himself from an unpopular government without losing the support of <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, a veteran campaigner, and resources like access to state media. Now and again, the two snipe at one another. <PERSON> Angelos </PERSON> says <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s proposals are `` simplistic. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> says <PERSON> Angelos </PERSON> represents a government `` that fulfilled only 5 percent of what it promised.'' But each for the moment seems more interested in polishing his own public image _ <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> as the charismatic champion of organized labor and the downtrodden, and <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> as the honest administrator and family man _ than in demolishing the other. `` I wo n't let you down'' is the slogan on Menem posters, which show the candidate with his hair to his shoulders and sideburns covering most of his cheeks. `` It can be done!'' is <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>'s slogan. He usually appears on posters and in person in a blue blazer and open-necked shirt, wearing thick-framed black glasses and a broad smile. <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON>, a lawyer and several times a losing candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, lacks a nationwide constituency and is little known outside the capital. What he really is aiming to do is increase the number of leftist legislators in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Alsogaray </PERSON>, for the same reasons, has little chance of winning. But the 75-year-old military engineer and former economy minister and ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a potential kingmaker. In a scenario that frustrates <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> and makes <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> credible despite any poll, no candidate will win enough votes to guarantee victory in the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, and the 600 electors pick a president, or failing to do that, pass the decision onto <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In either case, the conservative <PERSON> Alsogaray </PERSON> may trade his electors for political concessions, and his party has much more in common with the Radicals than the Peronists. In 1983, <PERSON> Alsogaray </PERSON> supported <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, reluctantly, to prevent a <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> victory. <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alsogaray </PERSON> insist their electors will vote for them. More importantly, both have rejected Peronist suggestions that the runners-up support the candidate who gets the most votes. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsogaray </PERSON>, a national deputy and key adviser to her father, in an interview published in the <ORGANIZATION> Buenos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aires </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged that in the end, either in the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, her party might provide the winning margin. She set no specific concessions the party would demand but insisted that `` any candidate wishing to get our votes would have to adhere'' to the party's platform, which calls for the privatization of state industries and minimal government, among other things.

 Tibetans and Chinese this week commemorate different sides of a bloody 1959 Tibetan rebellion against <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule. For Tibetans, Friday marks 30 years since they repudiated Chinese rule and surged into the streets to shield their spiritual leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, from an alleged kidnapping plot. Hundreds and perhaps thousands died when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> put down the revolt. For the Chinese, it marks the start of three decades of socialist `` democratic reform'' in the remote Himalayan region. Even before the anniversary date this week, more blood was shed when Tibetans shouting `` Free Tibet!'' clashed with police. At least a dozen people were killed when Tibetans marched behind their banned pre-communist flag and then attacked Chinese-owned businesses and government buildings. There is fear of more violence on Friday. Exactly what happened on March 10, 1959, and in the following weeks remains a subject of great controversy and there are few non-partisan accounts. A new generation of Tibetans said they do n't know who to believe `` Each side abuses the other,'' said a young Tibetan woman in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` If you read what is written by the exile -LRB- Tibetan -RRB- government in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, then the Chinese were invaders and the Tibetans were right to fight them. `` But if you read what <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says, you think, ` They are right, the Tibetans were wrong,''' she said. `` I can only judge the things I see now.'' But she and others of her generation expressed bitterness over the legacy of the 1959 rebellion: <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> has become an armed camp, and hatred runs deep between the native people and dominant Han Chinese. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> claims its sovereignty over <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> dates to the 13th century, when the <ORGANIZATION> Mongols </ORGANIZATION> who ruled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> sent an army into <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. But until <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> marched into <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> in 1950, there were long periods of virtually no contact between the two. Actual power lay with <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks under the leadership of the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, revered as the reincarnation of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s protector god. Eastern Tibetan clans began armed revolt against the communists in 1956, but <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> remained calm until 1959. Violence was touched off when the local Chinese general invited the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> to attend a theatrical show. A rumor spread that the army planned to kidnap the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> to force him to attend a legislative session in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. On the day of the show _ March 10 _ tens of thousands Tibetans surged around the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s palace to prevent him from attending. Some attacked Chinese targets. Secular Tibetan leaders seized the moment to declare independence, and monasteries seconded the call. A long standoff began, with the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> inside his palace urging both sides to stay calm. Finally on March 17, the Chinese allegedly fired two mortar shells into the palace grounds. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> and his family fled that night, eventually reaching <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Unaware of this, the crowd stood guard around the palace until March 20, when the Chinese army began steady shelling. After three days, the last resistance in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> was quelled. Rebel attacks on Chinese forces in remote areas continued for years, but to little effect. The Chinese blamed the revolt on the disgrunted former ruling class and moved to weaken it by dividing up the land and forming communes after the pattern set elsewhere in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. They also began a campaign to suppress <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s traditional Buddhist culture, peaking in the 1966-76 far leftist Cultural Revolution when thousands of monasteries were destroyed and monks were jailed or forced into labor. The small communities of monks and nuns that have grown again in the past decade seem radicalized by the experience. They have held pro-independence protests repeatedly in the past 18 months. Four violent clashes with police, including this week's, have left dozens dead and hundreds injured. The Chinese show no sign of yielding their hold on the region. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> <PERSON> Yinong </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said the government is in constant contact with the exiled <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, mainly through the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. But he said the two sides are unable to agree on terms for starting talks. `` Except for independence, anything can be discussed,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said last week. `` As for Tibetan autonomy, the Chinese government absolutely can not make any concessions.'' The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> has said he is willing to accept less than full independence and that his priority is to improve living conditions for his people. Speedy agreement is needed if Tibetan culture is to be preserved, he said last year. A recent broadcast by the official <ORGANIZATION> Lhasa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> was not optimistic. The struggle against separatists, it said, is an `` arduous and complex affair,'' and all involved `` must be mentally prepared for a long-term struggle.''

 Seventy-nine percent of Soviet women and 43 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> women think alcoholism is a chief cause of divorce, a poll shows. Poor communication wrecks most marriages, 77 of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women said in the survey. They ranked alcoholism second, while 39 percent of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> women ranked parental interference second. The survey, based on an unscientific sampling, was conducted by Woman's Day, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magazine geared toward suburban women, and <PERSON> Krestyanka </PERSON>, a Soviet magazine whose name translates as, `` Peasant Woman,'' although 54 percent of its respondents identified themselves as white-collar. `` This survey reveals there's nothing foreign about domestic difficulties,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, Woman's Day editor in chief. `` Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women have more in common than they may have thought: too much work, troubled marriages, husbands who wo n't help, and alcoholism. `` Stress is the great equalizer,'' said <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, associate professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who interpreted the poll for Woman's Day. `` Women have hit a strong stress point in both societies.'' Fifty-six percent of the Soviet women surveyed said an ideal husband should be faithful and a good head of the family. More than 63 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women mentioned `` communicative,'' `` emotionally supportive'' and `` faithful'' as the virtues of the ideal husband. Only 2 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women thought good homemaking skills make an ideal husband. Still, 61 percent said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> men must assume more responsibility for housework and 50 percent wanted men to help more with child care. Twenty percent of the Soviet women said men should do more at home and 13 percent said men should spend more time raising their kids. The surveys were conducted by mail so that rural <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> women without phones could be included. Women's Day received about 30,000 responses from women with a median age of 41; more than three-quarters are married and almost 90 percent have children. <PERSON> Krestyanka </PERSON> got back about 200,000 responses, with a median age of 30, three-fourths married and 78 percent with children.

Drug dealers' familiarity with the unmarked cars not only hampers undercover work but may endanger officers' lives, police said. The computerized list included makes, models and license plates.

 A federal jury Tuesday convicted a former aide to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> of accepting $ 1,300 in illegal payments from two <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> immigrants who had sought the senator's help <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> sat impassively, with one elbow on the defense table, when the verdict was read in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said, `` No comment,'' to reporters as he left the courtroom. His attorney, <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, said it was too early to say whether there would be an appeal. In a statement distributed in the federal courthouse after the verdict was read, <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said the decision was `` the end to a sad episode that began in November 1986,'' when he asked the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to investigate allegations that <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> had been acting improperly with his constituents. It is illegal for federal employees to accept money or any thing of value in return for performing their official duties. `` Those who are sworn to uphold the law should expect no leniency when they break the law,'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said. No date was set for sentencing. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> was convicted of accepting $ 300 from <PERSON> Irena </PERSON> <PERSON> Boc </PERSON>, who testified last week that she gave <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> the money in an envelope in 1983 to help her with an application for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship. <PERSON> Waclaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Pietrzykowski </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> solicited $ 2,300 from him in 1985 to help the daughter of his landlady, <PERSON> Anni </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojcieszko </PERSON>, with her application to the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pietrzykowski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wojcieszko </PERSON> testified they gave <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> $ 1,000 and that he later returned $ 500. The trial began March 1. In closing arguments, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> tried to shift blame for the alleged payoffs to others and to point up discrepancies in testimony. But prosecutors blamed the discrepancies on time lapses and the difficulty Polish witnesses had with the English language. `` The truth is <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> is the one ripping off these people,'' said <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a lawyer with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Integrity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Section </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> is the one who took advantage of some of the most vulnerable people in our society,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said.

 Attention, dieters. The musical recipe for a wickedly delicious chocolate cake by <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Child </PERSON> is being cooked up at the Kennedy Center tonight. It takes about 20 minutes to devour, and it does n't contain a single calorie. But composer <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON> warns that his `` Bon Appetit!'' a new musical monologue performed by actress <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> with <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON> at the piano, may tempt chocolate lovers to break their vows of abstinence. `` I am tempted not only by the lyrics but by the cake itself,'' confesses <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON>, who is trying to observe a diet of such macrobiotic foods as cabbage, brown rice and fish with seaweed. `` I often give in to temptation and say I'll make up for it later,'' he said during a prerehearsal interview. `` I love chocolate cake. The things that are out of reach are what we love in this world.'' <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON>'s piece is based on the videotape of a 1961 television cooking lesson by <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Child </PERSON>, and will be served as the dessert course for an evening of <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON>'s music at the Terrace Theater. After its world premiere here, <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> will perform the work at <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, on March 31 and at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, on April 9. On stage, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> sings and pantomimes her way around an imaginary kitchen, using lyrics taken from Miss Child's tape, as she prepares a `` very special, ve-e-ery choc ` late-ly, bittersweet, loooovely cake'' called <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Gateau </PERSON> au Chocolat, l ` Eminence `` What I love is her wonderful sense of theater,'' the actress says. `` She's not just a cook. She's a character, very rich and very humorous.'' Miss <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> makes the most of the TV chef's comic touches, tapping an invisible cake pan and instructing her audience to `` knock out the flour on the floor, if you have a self-cleaning kitchen like mine.'' And she engages in a fast-paced musical race with an electric mixer, as she beats egg whites in an unlined copper bowl. `` We're going to see who wins,'' she sings, `` and I think maybe I'll win ... because I'm bigger. <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON> says `` Bon Appetit!'' _ which takes its title from Miss Child's familiar closing line _ was composed as a concert curtain-raiser for a longer work he wrote in 1984, his operatic version of the late <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Draper </PERSON>'s monologue, `` The Italian Lesson.'' <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON> and associate <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulgasser </PERSON> came up with the idea of using the script of a Julia Child cooking lesson as a vehicle for Miss <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON>, a veteran of Broadway musicals who is better known as <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Edith </PERSON>, on the `` All in the Family'' TV series. Miss <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> wrote Miss Child for permission. Miss Child happily agreed, and sent a batch of her tapes for viewing. <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON>, who watched them for four full days, became intrigued by the chef's `` rhapsodic phrases'' and musical metaphors `` Her speaking patterns really grab you, the phraseology, the unexpected little interjections,'' he said. `` There is a kind of musical cadence in her speech which one is n't aware of unless one starts to set it to music, and then there it is.'' Is there something musical, too, about chocolate cake? `` Well, you see, chocolate cake, it's a very special moment,'' <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON> replied. `` It's an indulgence, something you do n't want to do too much of. It's like a reward _ you ate all your spinach, now you can have your reward. It's put in a very special category as a treat.'' Getting hungry? After tonight's concert, members of the audience will gather at a reception to nibble on the real thing, <LOCATION> Le </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gateau </LOCATION> au Chocolat, l'Eminence <PERSON> Brune </PERSON>, prepared from Miss Child's recipe by the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> chef. `` The cake is going to be the icing,'' says <PERSON> Shulgasser </PERSON>.

 The boyfriend of a mother of three can not spend the night while the children are home, the state's highest court has ruled. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday upheld a lower court decision to bar the boyfriend, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPippo </PERSON>, from staying overnight, saying the ruling raised no major constitutional issues. Civil libertarians expressed surprise at the decision and found the remark that the case raised no constitutional questions disturbing. `` I think that the state of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> has made a very poor statemeent about women, divorced women, single parents and their children, and their collective rights to privacy in their own homes,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> attorney for <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, were divorced in May 1986, and Ms. <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> was given custody of her children, two daughters and a son, ages 8 13 at the time. <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> was given visitation rights. In June, the <PERSON> Parrillos </PERSON> returned to <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, and Ms. <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> wanted her ex-husband to see the children in a location away from her home. <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> wanted his ex-wife restrained from having any `` unrelated males'' stay overnight at her house. Ms. <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> contended that her ex-husband began to harass her upon learning that she was dating DiPippo. DiPippo stayed overnight once or twice a week, Ms. <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> said, and it caused no harm to her children, who were in separate bedrooms. She told the court that her children liked <PERSON> DiPippo </PERSON>, but she had no plans to marry him in the near future. <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> began reducing his support payments when he learned <PERSON> DiPippo </PERSON> was visiting, the high court said. The children told the lower court's judge in a private meeting that they all got along well with <PERSON> DiPippo </PERSON>, although the son said there were times he disliked the man. But the judge ruled the overnight visits `` in the presence of the children, were not conducive to their general well-being, at least in terms of their psychological welfare,'' the high court said. The judge also had noted that if Ms. <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> married DiPippo, the issue would become moot. Ms. <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> appealed, saying the judge erred because no evidence existed that her sleeping with DiPippo psychologically harmed her children. But the high court upheld the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision, saying that ruling `` was without question directed at <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>. ... <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> may still visit the marital domicile overnight, with the exception of those times when the children are with their mother.'' <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> said she hoped Ms. <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> would appeal the decision. `` The practical effect on <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> is that she is precluded from conducting her private activities in the privacy of her own home at her discretion,'' she said.

<HEAD>Navy Recruit's Death Blamed on Safety Neglect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The death of a 19-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> recruit during training a year ago resulted from the service's neglect for safety procedures and pressure on the training system from higher-ups, according to a congressional investigation. In a report released Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, died at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swimmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in part because of `` an intimidating, non-volunteer atmosphere and inadequate controls at the school and its superior commands.'' Some of the flaws remain uncorrected, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. And it found that of 16 other <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> training deaths between Jan. 1, 1986, and the end of last year, safety problems contributed to five of the fatalities. `` The bottom line is that <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> instructors still are not trained to conduct high-risk training and that students still are not screened to make sure they can handle the dangers,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>., who requested the investigation along with the other members of the state's congressional delegation <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> called <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death `` a tragedy waiting to happen,'' pointing to <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> findings that he was unqualified for the swimming rescue course, had untrained and unsupervised instructors and was prevented from dropping out because of pressure on the school to increase the number of graduates it turned out. `` This <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report is a catalog of failures by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, which led to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death and others,'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said at a news conference. He vowed to follow up to see that remaining problems are resolved and asked Vice Admiral <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Disher </PERSON>, head of the service's training system, to contact families of recruits who died in training `` to tell them what really happened.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said it had discussed its findings with the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and reported that officials `` generally agreed'' and `` were receptive to suggestions on how to improve training safety'' and accident investigations. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> panicked during a swimming-pool drill known as `` sharks and daisies,'' in which swimmers must free themselves from an instructor who grabs them from behind, simulating a drowning person. After counseling and medical examination, he was found `` not physically qualified'' for the course because of a phobia of being held under water. But despite the findings, he was re-enrolled in the class and forced to undergo the drill again. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> left the pool and clutched an equipment rack, shouting such things as `` I quit'' and `` Please do n't put me back in the water,'' but was dragged back to the pool by instructors. After a struggle in the pool, he was removed unconscious and could not be revived. An autopsy found that <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> probably died of heartbeat irregularity caused by extreme fear, fatigue and decreased oxygen. The lead instructor was found guilty by a general court martial of negligent homicide and sentenced to a demotion and 90 days' confinement Eight others associated with the class were given various administrative punishments, including demotions and reprimands. Some improvements have been made, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The `` sharks and daisies'' drill has been dropped, instructors are given better training and safety equipment is kept on hand at the swimming pool. There also is a clearer policy regarding students' rights to drop out of a course, the investigators said. But the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said there remains great pressure on students not to drop out of a course because it is made clear to them that doing so will adversely affect their careers, and that there still is no system to alert instructors to students with a history of problems.

 <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not go into loving detail on what <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wore or who did her hair, but it did report on what the first lady was thinking about some world and domestic issues _ an unusual turn for Soviet media. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, wife of the president and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, spoke at a a reception she gave Monday in honor of International Women's Day, a Soviet holiday that is being celebrated today. She talked about her husband's reform policies and about how the world's women have improved prospects for peace, and <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, reported her views. State-run television frequently shows the stylish <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> first lady and Western journalists interview her. But it is rare for fellow Soviets to be let in on her thoughts. `` If people currently are more confident of a peaceful future, we know that much of the credit goes to women actively working on all continents for friendship, cooperation and profound mutual understanding of nations,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said at the reception, as reported by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. For <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> to be covering the reception itself _ for wives of ambassadors and other diplomats in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, wives of members of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> women in various fields _ was unusual. Before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power four years ago, <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> wives almost invariably were kept backstage. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> changed that. The attractive, 57-year-old former teacher of Marxist-Leninist philosophy has taken a role somewhat resembling that of the wife of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president. Not all Soviets are delighted with the change. Many are taken aback by her wardrobe, large and glamorous by Soviet standards. Others grumble that she is too involved in her husband's work. On Monday, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gave the grumblers some ammunition by going public with some of her views. Speaking of her husband's reforms, she said, `` Soviet people are putting into practice plans of revolutionary restructuring. We are connecting to it the destiny of our country, of our nation. We want our public life in all aspects _ socio-economic, political, moral, ecological, and in the sphere of human rights and freedoms _ to be worthy of a human being. `` By transforming and renewing our society on a socialist basis, on the principles of humanism and democracy, we are making our country more open for all the nations of the world.' She greeted her guests individually and gave each a bouquet, reported <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>, wife of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>. `` She's a very attractive, intelligent and vocal woman. If they let her speak more often, everyone would benefit,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The Gorbachevs later attended a televised celebration held in the <LOCATION> Bolshoi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to mark International Women's Day. This time, things were a little more typical. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sat on the dais with other Politburo members and dignitaries. His wife was in the audience.

<HEAD>Whistleblower Bill on the Move Again in the Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bill to protect so-called `` whistleblowers'' who expose government waste, fraud and abuse is back in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> after a compromise between sponsors and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. `` This very well might be the first bill to be signed by the president this year,'' Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, said at a news conference Tuesday in which sponsors unveiled a revised version of the measure. The bill would ease the way for federal employees to win reinstatement if demoted or fired after disclosing mismanagement. Then-President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> blocked the measure by a pocket veto, meaning he refused to sign the bill and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was out of session at the time. He said it could result in the government fighting legal battles against itself. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s move received heavy criticism in a surprised <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and from Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Lawmakers agreed under the compromise to give up a provision of last year's bill that would have allowed a special counsel representing employees to go to court, said Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich. In turn, the administration agreed to a provision barring the special counsel from opposing whistleblowers in any action before the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the agency that enforces civil service safeguards. The administration also agreed to greater privacy protection under the bill, while the senators approved a minor rewording under which employees are deemed whistleblowers if their exposure of waste, fraud or abuse was `` a contributing factor'' in the decision to discipline them. The change inserted the word `` contributing.'' Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> promised in a letter to <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> `` our cooperation to discourage any amendments, in either body of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, that might in any way interfere with this agreement.'' `` None of the changes to which we have agreed detracts in any way from the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' intent to strengthen whistleblower protections,'' the letter said.

 Mayor <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoemehl </PERSON>, seeking to become only the third mayor in city history to gain a third term, easily won the Democratic primary on Tuesday against two oppponents.

<HEAD>Voter Turnout Again Down Except Among the Elderly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Older Americans flexed their political muscles last November, while interest in choosing a new president flagged among other age groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reports. Some 68.8 percent of people aged 65 and over reported going to the polls last fall, the only age group to show an increase from the election four years earlier, according to the analysis released on Tuesday. Senior citizens voted at a 67.7 percent rate in 1984. `` The elderly have been getting a lot of attention and have become a great deal more active then ever before,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> statistician <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>. `` They are becoming a much more self-conscious group than before and are beginning to recognize their power.'' While the over-65 group was tops in turnout, the 45-to-64 age segment was n't far behind at 67.9 percent last November. But that was down from 69.8 percent four years earlier. Turnout by voters aged 25 to 44 fell from 58.4 percent to 54.0 percent, and in the 18 to 24 group it dropped from 40.8 percent to 36.2 percent. Overall, the Census analysis found voter turnout down 3 percentage points from 1984 and _ at 57 percent _ the lowest since the bureau began asking about voting in 1964. As usual, more people told the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> they had voted than there were votes actually cast, a phenomenon which the bureau gently terms `` misreporting.'' The total vote amounted to about 50 percent of the number of people of voting age in the country, the post-election count found. But when the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> surveyed about 55,000 households two weeks after the election, 57.4 percent reported having gone to the polls. Does that mean people lie to the census takers? `` Yes,'' said <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, `` That's the greater part of it.'' The purpose of the survey is not to find out how many people voted _ to do that you have to count the votes, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> pointed out. The survey compares the turnout among regions and groups of people. That comparison is valid, he said, `` with one group misreporting about as much as another.'' Either way, it was a 3 percentage point drop from 1984 and the lowest turnout in many years. At 57 percent, the Census figure is the lowest ever recorded by that agency, while the national vote total has n't been as low as half in a presidential year since 1924, according to figures compiled by the private Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. The drop in turnout was greatest for blacks and Hispanics, the Census study found. `` By and large, when there is a change in voter turnout it is greatest in segments of the population which have the lowest turnout to begin with,'' <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said. `` I suspect that is what is happening here.'' Only 51.5 percent of voting-age blacks said they had cast ballots, down from 55.8 percent four years earlier. For Hispanics the decline was from 32.6 percent to 28.8 percent. The white turnout fell from 61.4 percent to 59.2 percent between 1984 and 1988. Women held their lead over males in voting, 58.3 percent to 56.4 percent last year. In 1984 women had led 60.8 percent to 59.0 percent. As usual, the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> topped the nation last fall with 62.9 percent reporting they voted, a drop from 65.7 percent in 1984. The Northeast was second at 57.4 percent, down from 59.7 percent. Turnout in the West fell from 58.5 percent to 55.6 percent, while in the South it dropped from 56.8 percent to 54.5 percent between 1984 and 1988. Education seems to encourage voting, with 77.6 percent of college graduates turning out. Next were people with some college, 64.5 percent and then high school graduates, 54.7 percent. Only 41.3 percent of those who had n't finished high school voted, and turnout was 36.7 percent for people who had n't gone beyond grade school. People with jobs outvoted the unemployed, 58.4 percent to 38.6 percent. People who own their own home turned out at a 70.0 percent rate, while only 39.8 percent of renters reported voting. Because it is based on a survey the study can be subject to sampling error. The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> estimates the margin of error for the overall turnout at four-tenths of 1 percent.

 The Landsat earth-sensing satellites appear to be getting a reprieve, with an administration pledge to keep them running and a variety of federal agencies being asked to foot the bill. The two satellites had been threatened with a shutdown when funds ran out on March 31. But <PERSON> Thonas </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyke </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> reported that while details remain to be worked out, the administration is committed to keep the satellite system running. A shutdown would have amounted to `` turning off the lights, closing the door and retiring from the field,'' of remote sensing, said Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on natural resources. The federal agencies that make the most use of the satellite data are being asked to contribute to keep the system operating after March 31, <PERSON> Pyke </PERSON> told the subcommittee. It will cost about $ 9.4 million to keep the system running for the rest of the fiscal year. <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, told the subcommittee that he has a meeting scheduled with Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to discuss details of the funding. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been coordinating the new Landsat funding as head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've got to stop this damned nonsense,'' <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> said of the Landsat funding problem. Funding was a continuing battle under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which initiated the transfer of the system to private hands. That transfer, to the <ORGANIZATION> Earth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, is incomplete. Federal money is still used in operating the satellites, which measure land use, water flow, vegetation and mineral locations and provide detailed mapping information. The two satellites are currently beyond their original design lifetimes. A replacement, Landsat 6, is n't scheduled for launch until 1991. In the meantime, <ORGANIZATION> Landsats </ORGANIZATION> 4 and 5 continue to supply useful data. If they are turned off for lack of funds the only source for similar information would be the French SPOT-Image satellite system or the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pyke </PERSON> told the subcommittee that the EOSAT company, the private firm handling the Landsat data, has been asked to contribute part of the funding to keep the satellites running, but no commitment has been received. Federal agencies that seem likely sources of funds, he said, include the <ORGANIZATION> Departments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, Agriculture and Interior and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, urged that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> be asked for assistance as well. `` It's an absolute shame that we've come to this juncture,'' concluded Rep. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>. He termed threatening to shut down the satellites a `` pretty expensive game of chicken.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush News Conferences Abound</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, forced by a winter storm to cancel a trip to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, decided it was `` an opportune moment to stay indoors.'' So he held a news conference. In office barely six weeks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already has been meeting with reporters with greater frequency than any president since <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> only held three news conference in his final year in office _ a level <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> surpassed in his first month. Tuesday's session was the third general-purpose news conference that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has held in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, although he has yet to make an appearance in prime time. He also held forth at some length at a Feb. 6 news conference in the Old Executive Office Building called to announce his plan to bail out failed savings and loans. And he fielded wide-ranging questions twice, on successive days, in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> during his trip earlier this month to northeast <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. White House aides cite these appearances to assert that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has held six news conferences so far _ although the definition of a news conference in the <ORGANIZATION> Bush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> remains a bit blurry. That's partly <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s doing. Since he says he wo n't answer questions at picture-taking sessions, any time he decides to break his own rule the session becomes a mini-news conference. Sometimes the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chalks it up as an `` Oval Office Press Session.'' Counting these sessions, add three more to the list of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> question-and-answers encounters with reporters, says deputy press secretary <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. These, plus a joint news conference <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> with Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> on Feb. 10, raises to 10 the number of times <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as president has stood or sat before microphones and answered questions from reporters in a more-or-less orderly fashion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s moving target for ground rules on what constitutes a picture-taking session, or so-called `` photo op,'' and what constitutes a news conference, has led to some convoluted presidential verbiage. For instance, the other day when he wanted to make a statement but take no questions, he declared the event to be: `` a modified limited photo op cum statement, sans questions.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself is keeping track of his accessibility. After one recent session at which he took a few questions, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was overheard boasting about his availability to lawmakers sitting with him in the Cabinet Room. `` I want these stats out there -LRB- on how many times he's taken questions -RRB- in case there is a dry spell,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. For the record, <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> held 998 news conferences during his 15 years in office, or an average 6.9 per month, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. Other recent presidents and their per-month averages: <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, 324 or 3.5 per month; <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, 193 or 2 per month; <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 64 or 1.8 per month; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 135 or 2.2 per month; <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, 37 or 0.6 per month; <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, 39 or 1.3 per month; <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, 59 or 1.2 per month; <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, 50 or 0.5 per month.

 When you're a 28-year-old civilian in a roomful of top military brass, there is something to be said for having an authoritative voice.

<HEAD>More of Livestock Industry in Hands of Fewer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The livestock industry is growing even more concentrated in the hands of relatively few operators, says an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analyst. `` While there are still thousands of small livestock producers, their number has declined substantially in recent decades,'' says <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` In 1987, the four largest slaughter firms accounted for 67 percent of steer and heifer slaughter, up from 35 percent in 1979.'' Meanwhile, the market share of the four companies for hog slaughter increased to 37 percent from 34 percent. The share for sheep and lamb slaughter rose to 75 percent 1987 from 64 percent in 1979. `` Among producers, cattle feedlots show a high degree of concentration,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. `` Of 42,081 feedlots in the 13 major feeding states, which account for 90 percent of all fed -LRB- cattle -RRB- marketings in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, the 200 largest accounted for nearly half of the 1987 marketings.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, who writes in the March issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine, said firms merge and take over other companies to `` to improve efficiency in management and production, and perhaps to gain market power.'' Some practice vertical integration by taking over at least two stages of the production and marketing pipeline. `` For example, <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>, both major processors, have interests in grain marketing, livestock and poultry production, and meat processing,'' he said. `` Some firms expand horizontally by acquiring other firms in different industries. The diversification cuts risks if one industry goes into a decline.'' The trend to fewer meat packers means fewer potential livestock buyers in local markets, and <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said shifts from organized public markets toward direct sales to packers have cut market contacts for many small producers. `` Larger packers also have acquired some country buying points formerly owned by cooperatives or small marketing firms,'' he said. `` In a recent survey, producers said they had fewer bidders for their livestock in 1988 than in 1982.'' By and large, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said, the worries of consumers, small processors and small producers focus on the growing market power of the big companies. They fear the big firms are cutting prices received by small farmers and are boosting consumer meat prices. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said the growth of big companies also gives rise to fears of discrimination against independent suppliers, small customers and workers. There are also fears of predatory pricing to force out small competitors. But consolidation `` could be beneficial'' if such fears and concerns are dealt with, he said. Livestock production and processing show economies of scale, where larger size of operations lowers the per unit costs of production. `` Large firms can benefit from such economies and at the same time invest in product and market development,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. `` Such firms can pass on savings to farmers and consumers _ savings that would not be possible in a less concentrated livestock and meat industry.'' The question, he said, is who benefits. `` When a few firms dominate, the cost savings could stay mostly with the firms,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. `` Where there is competition, the savings ultimately will show up as lower consumer prices. One way to keep the benefits of bigness and foster competition is to open up world livestock and meat markets to more international competition.''

 Despite smaller yields because of last year's drought, vegetable producers nationwide probably took in a record dollar value for their crops, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Although there was no estimate for 1988, growers' receipts `` likely increased slightly'' from the record level of $ 9.2 billion in 1987 because of higher prices, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` Total output of vegetables probably fell about 4 percent in 1988 because of declines in potato, dry bean and processing vegetable production,'' the agency said in an outlook report. `` Assuming normal weather, output should rebound in 1989.'' Per capita use of vegetables, which probably declined in 1988 because of smaller production, is expected to return to pre-drought levels this year. `` Utilization probably will continue to be enhanced by general economic conditions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the report said. `` With real disposable incomes and employment remaining relatively strong, domestic demand for all types of vegetable should continue robust.'' Exports of fresh vegetables, which soared in 1988, are expected to continue rising this year, reflecting the decline in the dollar and growth in the Japanese market, the report said. One reason for the export increase is a rise in french fry shipments to <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> countries. Potato prices paid to growers are projected to average even higher than the department's initial forecast of $ 5.49 per hundredweight, the report said. Last year's average was $ 4.35 per 100 pounds. As a result, potato farmers are expected to expand their 1989 acreage.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s antitrust chief is promising tougher enforcement of laws to preserve competition in the airlines industry. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rule </PERSON> said in a speech Tuesday that the antitrust division would take a harder look at mergers than did the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which gave up its authority to review airline deals at the end of 1988. `` Perhaps somewhat overlooked by <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> in the course of deregulating the airline industry, the antitrust laws have a valuable role to play to ensure that a competitive environment does not sow the seeds of its own demise,'' Rule told the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` The antitrust division intends to use its new-found authority _ as well as pre-existing authority _ to apply those laws with appropriate care in order to ensure that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline markets remain competitive in the years to come,'' Rule said. `` We will ask whether the merger will result in increased prices to consumers by creating, enhancing, or facilitating the exercise of market power without generating offsetting efficiencies,'' he said. Rule said that an unanticipated result of airline deregulation has been that carriers have become entrenched in regions even though the changes `` have generally benefited consumers by dramatically increasing the efficiency of airline service.'' He cited computerized reservation systems, which give their owners an upper hand in getting bookings despite <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> rules. `` Whether or not this advantage represents an efficiency, it does place new entrants at a disadvantage,'' he said. Rule did not say what position the department would take on the proposal to merge the computerized reservation systems of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> airlines. `` The effect of such an acquisition of an ownership interest in a CRS by the owner of a competing system is not at all obvious,'' Rule said. `` Rather the effects are likely to be very complex and involve a tradeoff of costs and benefits. Our investigation of the American @ <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> agreement should enlighten us about the nature of that tradeoff.'' Combinations of airlines that have regional hubs in the same city would be opposed by the antitrust division, which unsuccessfully urged the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> not to allow the TWA-Ozark and the Northwest-Republic mergers, Rule said. But Rule noted that `` there are very few such mergers that are even conceivable today.'' In recent years, the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> approved nearly two dozen airline mergers, prompting criticism from consumer groups that it was giving the industry too free a hand. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s administrative authority lapsed on Dec. 31, 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> now has jurisdiction over airline mergers as it does in other industries. <PERSON> Conn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>, director of the aviation law project of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group founded by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>: `` We'll have to see if words are accompanied by deeds The American-Delta merger will provide some important clues.''

 The <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance's main backer, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, has lessened its once firm support for a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in postwar <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and for other key resistance proposals, a guerrilla leader says. Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON> also said Tuesday that he would leave for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this weekend to ask <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for more covert aid to force <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to be more flexible at the negotiating table. The resistance has repeatedly requested arms, but <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> provides only limited non-lethal aid. <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON> is the son of central Cambodian resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and commands one of three guerrilla groups resisting <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s 10-year-old occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. He told a group of reporters that <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION>'s support for the resistance proposals weakened at peace talks last month in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> mediated those talks, which brought together <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the warring factions in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON> said he was troubled by the shift. He said only a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force can prevent renewed fighting and a return of Vietnamese troops, who have said they hope to withdraw next year, or by brutal <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the government it installed in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> have opposed introducing an armed international force. `` I am very sorry for the sake of my people that the <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> stand is not as firm as before,'' <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON> told a group of reporters. He said a majority of <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> delegates at the conference did not support an international peackeeping force and no longer clearly support the idea of an interim postwar government under <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s leadership and comprised of the three resistance factions and the Vietnam-backed regime. `` They do not support even the idea of having free self-determination and free elections in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' he said. In 1982, <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> sponsored the formation of the guerrilla coalition. It gives the group sanctuary and arms and leads the diplomatic struggle against <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The non-Communist <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> includes <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The guerrilla coalition joins the nationalist forces of <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> with a group they strongly distrust, the militarily potent <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. The fanatical Communist group killed hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975 until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ousted it in the late 1978 invasion. <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON> would not name the <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> countries whose support had weakened, nor say why that support had weakened. He said, however, that said a notable exception was <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON>. In January, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON> was host to an unprecedented visit to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, premier of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Vietnamese-installed government Some diplomats said <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> has seriously weakened the resistance in his rush to get a settlement and transform <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s battlefields into markets for Thai goods <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON> has said his father, who had quit as resistance coalition president, resumed the post in February to counter the increasing worldwide support for Hun Sen. <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON> said that during his trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> he would tell officials that other steps are needed to weaken the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> aside from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attempts to pressure <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to halt its aid to them. He expressed optimism that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which arms the guerrillas, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which arms <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, will reach an agreement on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> during their summit in May. He said they recently had converged on many points and all that remains was for the Soviets to guarantee a Vietnamese pullout and the Chinese to guarantee in turn that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> will not return to power. `` If they will overcome this, -LRB- the settlement is -RRB- finished,'' <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he's been told by a fellow from <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, not to worry about all the inside-Washington talk about an administration aimless and adrift. `` All the people in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> think things are going just great,'' the president says. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants assurance that the people will tell him when things are going just great, and not so great, all he has to do is wander down <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> to the National Archives, storehouse of the nation's records. An exhibition there celebrates 200 years of the people petitioning the government _ or giving it a piece of its mind. Exhibit A along those lines comes from a boy named <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, who was in H.B. <ORGANIZATION> Milnes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, when President <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> pardoned President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> for the crimes of Watergate. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> had a fixed mixed opinion: `` Dear President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, `` I think you are half right and half wrong. `` Yours truly, `` <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, replacing Reaganites with Bushites, also would find familiar echoes in the 1789 complaint of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodard </PERSON>, who lost her job as postmaster of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> after serving through the tough days of the Revolutionary War. Said her petition: `` She hath been discharged without the smallest imputations of any fault, and without any previous notice whatever. ... These are but poor rewards indeed for 14 years faithful services, performed in the worst of times.'' To no avail. She did n't get reinstated. The Constitution's First Amendment gives the people the right `` to petition the government for a redress of grievances.'' But even before the government existed, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people were exercising their right to talk back to authority. In 1773, the governor of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> petitioned a member of the British <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to protest the closing of the port of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in retaliation for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He wrote, `` We are at a loss to conceive how the destruction of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>'s tea could be a just or reasonable ground for punishing so severely thousands of innocent people.'' Seventeen years later, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Quakers petitioned for the abolition of slavery: `` The blessings of liberty ... ought rightfully to be administered, without distinction of color, to all descriptions of people.'' Some petitions to government have been eloquent, some funny, some moving. <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a slave from northern <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> whose mistress refused to let her join her family, wrote to President <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. She urgently wanted to know her status: `` You will please let me know if we are free ...'' One of the biggest petitions ever to reach <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> remains in the condition received in 1893 _ rolled up on two huge wooden spools nearly seven feet high. It consists hundreds of sheets, taped together, bearing an estimated 150,000 signatures, appealing for a new bureaucracy. `` We the undersigned ... hereby most respectfully petition that there be founded ... a <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, similar to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, for the purpose of promoting knowledge in the art of constructing and maintaining roads.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> obliged by creating the Office of Road Inquiry in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. Must have pleased the petition's creator, a bicycle manufacturer. Few petitions have had as deep an impact as the one <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> wrote in pencil in 1961 from his prison cell in <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, where he was serving five years for breaking into a poolroom. `` The question is very simple. I requested the court to appoint me an attorney and the court refused.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed. Its landmark <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> decision upheld the right of poor defendants to be represented by lawyers, at the public expense if need be. In the midst of the Depression, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> got a petition from some young citizens of the <ORGANIZATION> Cream </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hyde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, protesting the removal of a teacher: `` Do we have to have another teacher when we want Mrs. <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> so much? Mr. <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> you do so many big things, ca n't you find a way to help us in this little thing? Because this is a big thing to us kids. It's a pretty tough ` new deal' for us young Democrats and Republicans.'' But even <ORGANIZATION> FDR </ORGANIZATION> knew the limits of his powers. Mrs. <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Postmistress </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodard </PERSON>, did n't get her job back, the petitions of the people notwithstanding.

<HEAD>Senate Tempers Wear Thin in Tower Debate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Flattery is the first and firmest rule in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but in a single day the debate on Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> produced a series of mutual attacks on integrity, motives and competence. Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> touched off Tuesday's fireworks when he announced that <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., had detailed investigators to check new allegations against Tower `` Partisan unit,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> later called it. `` Strike force.'' `` Highly questionable if not inappropriate,'' Republican Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> said. `` I think it needs to be pursued to see where it leads us.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, leader of the Tower opposition, defended himself a short while later by saying he had been informed the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> would no longer look into allegations against Tower. He then was asked about Republican claims that his effort to derail Tower is really an attempt to grab power for himself at the Pentagon, or perhaps jockey for position in the 1992 White House campaign. `` It's an onslaught,'' he said, `` The basic rule is if you do n't have the facts on your side, you try to destroy the credibility of someone who is presenting them on the other side So I think that formula is in full effect right now.'' And when Democrat <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> said that an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report on Tower turned up evidence of `` wrongdoing,'' Republican <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> replied tartly. That was n't so, he said _ at least not the way Americans use the term. `` I'm an American, too,'' shot back <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>. Hearing <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>'s retort, <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> persisted that Tower had committed no legal wrongdoing. Shot back <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, `` In my judgment it's wrong. OK?'' But the sharpest exchanges were saved for an extraordinary late afternoon performance. Roughly 30 senators stayed in their seats for the debate, the ultimate courtesy in an institution where most lawmakers come to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber only to cast their votes before hurrying back to their offices. They saw an exchange between <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, who said it was a `` fact'' that there was no evidence in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report that Tower had ever been impaired by alcohol in performing his duties. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a former judge, interrupted to say that was <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>'s opinion, not a fact <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> said he had spent 24 years practicing law, and knew how to read evidence. `` I think I know how to do that just as well as you do,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who is a former federal judge as well as a lawyer. `` I'm sure,'' shot back <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> attorney general. Nothing was too good to pass up as partisan feelings boiled over. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> complained bitterly that Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION> was guilty of `` vicious personal attacks'' for earlier citing allegations contained in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report from witnesses who said they had seen Tower `` crocked,'' `` sloshed,'' and `` comatose.'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> protested, but <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> persisted that the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolinian </LOCATION> was an insulter of longstanding. He referred to the `` comment he once made about the senator from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'' and later referred to a long-ago crack about the `` senator from <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>.'' The first was a reference to <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>' description of Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> years ago as the senator from B'nai B'rith. The second was <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>' one-time description of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Amidst the partisan crossfire, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s irritation with one of his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> colleagues, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, slipped out. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said that as the senior <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> had known what <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> was doing but had not passed the word along to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leadership. `` I do n't know why he did n't tell me,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said of his <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> colleague. `` He should have.''

 An <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> company was inviting criticism when it sent a sample of its windshield-cleaning product to `` 60 Minutes'' commentator <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> has argued.

<HEAD>Bush Says Administration not Stalled</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is trying to dispel an impression that `` nothing is happening'' in his young administration, saying it has n't been stalled by his struggle to win confirmation of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as defense secretary. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday responded to news reports that his administration is adrift by recounting actions he has taken such as developing a savings and loan rescue plan, meeting with foreign leaders and presenting a budget package to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` My response is it's not adrift and there is n't malaise,'' he said. `` I would simply resist the clamor that nothing seems to be bubbling around, that nothing is happening. A lot is happening. Not all of it good, but a lot is happening.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in an impromptu news conference, also reiterated his opposition to White House intervention in the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike. He said pilots threatening a slowdown to support the striking machinists should not `` make the innocent traveling public a pawn in this dispute.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued to stand by Tower, as he picked up a piece of good news in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> fight over confirmation _ a second Democrat, Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, announced he would vote for the nominee. `` I believe he is the best man for the job,'' the president said of Tower. `` I'm not going to pull back on this.'' He noted that Tower has pledged not to take another drink if confirmed, and said, `` You'll have 25,000 people in the Pentagon making sure that's true.'' To counter allegations that his administration is stalled, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited a phone conversation with a friend in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who told him, `` All the people in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> think things are going just great.'' The friend was campaign contributor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, an oil and gas businessman and longtime friend of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I think we're on track,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was responding to news reports that the uphill Tower confirmation fight has diverted attention from other administration business, particularly appointment of key personnel, and that after six weeks <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidency is floundering. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would like to see his appointments move more quickly, but he claimed that he is ahead of where the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was on appointments at this point in 1981. He acknowledged that trouble in getting a <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary confirmed was `` an inhibiting factor'' in completing a strategic review on defense but said, `` I hope there's not going to be any slippage'' in meeting a May 10 deadline. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he has `` total confidence'' in his White House chief of staff, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> governor who has been criticized for alleged tactical errors in the Tower nomination struggle. On other subjects, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: _ He has directed his nominee for drug policy coordinator, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, to look into ways to block criminal use of semiautomatic assault guns The president, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, previously said he opposed banning such weapons. But he said he told <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> he would take a hard look at any `` sensible answer'' the drug czar proposes. _ There `` has to be some linkage'' between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward the Soviets and the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s behavior in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> Reiterating that he will push at the end of this month for new humanitarian aid for the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated he is looking to the Soviets to pull back on their military aid to the ruling Sandinista government there. _ He is as committed to human rights as former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was, though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't publicly focus on the issue even when <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities prevented the nation's leading dissident from attending a dinner <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> invited him to in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` quiet discussion'' is the best way to voice human rights concerns. He did not mention Chinese actions in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, where demonstrators are protesting Chinese occupation and report widespread human rights abuses.

<HEAD>Random Testing Finds Drugs in Air Controllers, Others</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Air traffic controllers were the largest single group of federal employees to test positive for illegal drugs under the government's program of random testing, a published report says. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that 203 federal workers have tested positive out of the 30,307 employees tested so far in the random, spot-checking urinalysis program. That translates into a rate of 0.7 percent. Among those testing positive were 60 air traffic controllers and 42 employees in the nuclear and chemical weapons security program, the newspaper reported. The remaining 101 were in a number of positions, including jobs involving aviation safety, enforcement of drug laws and rehabilitation of drug users. The overwhelming majority of those testing positive had used marijuana, which can be detected in the urine as long as two months after being smoked. Urine samples from 47 employees showed traces of cocaine, which can remain in the body for three days. `` Nobody has been caught who has his finger over the button, or even anybody directly in contact with nuclear or chemical weapons,'' said <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> <PERSON> Eversole </PERSON>, an Army spokesperson. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, special counsel to the assistant attorney general of the civil division, said, `` The real danger comes from inattention, from an unsafe condition someone does n't notice'' at a nuclear or chemical weapon site. When job applicants and workers who were acting suspiciously are included with workers caught up in random tests, at least 49,751 people have been tested, with the results revealing a drug-use rate of 0.6 percent among reporting agencies, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Government Says Soviets Massacred Polish Soldiers During WWII</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government says it has concluded what most Poles have long accepted as fact: that Soviet forces, not Nazi troops, systematically massacred more than 4,000 interned Polish army officers during World War II. The statement on Tuesday represented Communist authorities' first official rejection of the longtime Soviet line on the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> massacre _ perhaps the most sensitive and emotional issue in Soviet-Polish relations. `` We think that everything indicates that the crime was committed by the Stalinist NKVD,'' the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>'s predecessor, government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said during his weekly news conference. The Polish government also pressed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to speed its review of the incident. The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not report the development. The announcement comes at a crucial moment in monthlong talks between the government and opposition on restoring the legal status of the Solidarity free trade union movement and ending an acute economic crisis. The slain officers were among 15,000 Polish reserve officers rounded up by the invading Soviets in 1939 and Nazi troops uncovered their bodies in 1943 from common graves in the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> forest near the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION>. Each had been killed by a single bullet to the back of the head. Official Soviet and Polish histories have long held that the officers were killed by the <PERSON> Nazis </PERSON>, who broke a non-aggression pact and invaded the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1941, but Western historians blamed the Soviets. No trace was found of the other nearly 11,000 reserve officers and many Poles consider their disappearance and the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> massacre a deliberate effort by <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> to eliminate the cream of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s intelligensia For them, the very legitimacy of the ruling Communists in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is undermined by the ruthless methods <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> employed in seeing to it that they came to power after the war. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> formed a joint commission in 1987 to consider the evidence on <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> and other so-called `` blank spots'' in Polish-Soviet history. The Polish side has submitted its material and indications have emerged of growing impatience with the Soviet review. Last month, an official newspaper published a story on a wartime <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> report that concludes what Western historians have long held _ that the officers murdered at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> were killed by the Soviets in 1940. Urban has previously said the inscription on a monument in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> blaming the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> will be changed. On Tuesday, he said Soviet historians were analyzing historial material on the massacre `` and are right to state that it's only circumstantial evidence.'' But he said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> wants the Soviets to speed up their review of the material. `` The difficult process of erasing blank spots in <LOCATION> Polish-Soviet </LOCATION> relations'' should serve to strengthen friendship between the two countries and to support `` Soviet perestroika instead of damaging it,'' Urban added. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was attacked first by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> from the <LOCATION> west </LOCATION> and then from the east by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in September 1939.

<NOTE>Senators Propose Permanent Airline Smoking Ban</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> has endorsed a proposal by two senators to permanently ban cigarette smoking on all domestic flights. The measure introduced Tuesday would expand the current prohibition against smoking, which covers flights of two hours or less and is due to expire in April 1990. `` The time has come to protect the health and safety of all airline passengers,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, who co-sponsored the bill with Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>. At the senators' news conference to announce the proposal, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said such a ban is `` long overdue.'' He cited a recent study by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> which found that passengers in non-smoking sections of airliners had levels of nicotine in their saliva and urine similar to travelers in smoking areas. The bill would leave intact the $ 1,000 fine that can be levied against those violating the smoking ban, and the $ 2,000 penalty for people caught tampering with smoke detectors in airline restrooms.

 <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> says he sees no reason to change the new catastrophic care program financed by a surtax on elderly Americans. `` We're aware of a number of concerns that have been expressed -LRB- about the financing provision -RRB- but ... we are also concerned about the many examples of our elderly citizens being wiped out financially by the tremendous costs of illness,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` We feel that because this legislation has just been enacted we do n't have much experience with it yet. We'd like to follow this and see if adjustments need to be made,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Leaders in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also have been generally unsympathetic to complaints from senior citizens who oppose the financing provision of the program, which helps the elderly and disabled bear the cost of illness that otherwise would threaten their financial stability. For Medicare-eligible Americans _ those who are over 65 or disabled _ whose incomes are high enough that they pay at least $ 150 a year in federal income taxes, the surtax is 15 percent of their income tax this year. Next year it is 25 percent and it could rise by as much as 1 percentage point a year after that.

 Legislation to impose a uniform closing time for polls across the 48 contiguous states has cleared a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. The elections subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved the measure Tuesday on a voice vote. Rep. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, D-Wash., the subcommittee chairman, said he expects <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will approve the bill this year The measure, similar to ones twice approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, now goes to the full committee. Election officials in the West have complained that voters in their states sometimes decide not to vote when the winner of a presidential election is known before their polls close and that the drop in turnout has affected the outcome of close local races. Under the bill, polls would close simultaneously in the 48 contiguous states at 9 p.m. EST. In the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zone </ORGANIZATION>, daylight saving time would be extended for a maximum of two weeks in presidential election years. The extension would allow polls in that time zone to close at 7 p.m. PDT. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> are exempt from the legislation.

 Pre-dawn arrests of 57 people on poaching charges came under sharp attack, with one official saying residents of the economically depressed <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> were entrapped by the lure of fast money. State and federal warrants cited more than 850 alleged wildlife violations involving bear, bobcat, elk, deer and bald and golden eagles, among other animals. About 275 game officials, aided by aircraft, made the arrests early Monday in the valley and the <LOCATION> Taos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, areas. Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said he had been told in advance about the raid, but was unaware of the planned tactics, which triggered at least 30 complaints from people who said they were unnecessarily harassed. `` Obviously I am concerned about the feeling, the trauma in that community,'' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said Tuesday at a cabinet meeting in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` I do not criticize the fact we have to enforce the law. I simply ... and I do not want to make judgments about how it was done. ... I simply know that there was trauma that resulted from it.'' Costilla County Sheriff <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> said wildlife agents kicked in doors, dragged people outside in their underwear at gunpoint and improperly stopped and searched people. `` People were crying, babies were crying,'' he said. `` They -LRB- wildlife officers -RRB- did n't care.'' <PERSON> Galen </PERSON> <PERSON> Buterbaugh </PERSON>, regional director of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, denied <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON>'s charges and said the sheriff and others were worried about retaliation. <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> said he and his family have been threatened by people who assumed he was involved in the operation. He said he sent two of his children out of town and a third child was wearing a bulletproof vest. His house was burned down two years ago after he angered some residents by breaking up a disturbance at a party. <PERSON> Buterbaugh </PERSON> said so many agents were needed to make the arrests because the suspects had threatened federal officials. The investigation targeted commercial poachers, who illegally hunt and sell game, and used an undercover agent who posed as a taxidermist first in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garland </LOCATION>, 175 miles south of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, and later in <LOCATION> Costilla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> Officials said up to 100 could be arrested before the 2 -LCB- - year-old investigation ends <PERSON> Buterbaugh </PERSON> said the undercover agent did not encourage poaching and paid less than the going rate for carcasses. The area was targeted because the agent happened to be there and because there were reports of a huge market in illegally obtained wildlife, <PERSON> Buterbaugh </PERSON> said. `` We always work to make sure that we do not create a market -LRB- for illegal wildlife -RRB-,'' he said. `` The market there was very large.'' `` The operation was well-performed in a highly professional and highly workmanlike fashion,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION>, where wildlife officials displayed dozens of illegal trophies and carcasses that had been confiscated. But the sheriff said the agent, known in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, was known to hang out in bars and `` place orders with poachers.'' He said that encouraged poaching and entrapped residents. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> chronically posts 20 percent unemployment. One of every three people is on government aid. `` For that part of the county that is unemployed, $ 500 or $ 600 sounds real good to them. They're going to go for it,'' <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> said. Officials would not say how much the agent paid for carcasses. `` Why did they bring 250 people with helicopters and guns and everything else?'' <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> asked. `` We're not animals; we're human beings. I do n't know what they were expecting _ a war or something? This is n't <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> town trustee <PERSON> Augustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaramillo </PERSON> said the board `` will pass a resolution Wednesday asking Governor <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> to investigate the tactics used in this so-called raid.'' The governor did not immediately respond to the request.

<HEAD>Nuclear Ship A `Homeless Child' After Port Cities Refuse Entry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lingering fears left by the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> disaster are partly behind the public protests that have prevented a nuclear-powered merchant ship from entering eastern Soviet ports, a newspaper says. The 860-foot Sevmorput had been anchored off <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> for four days because the city council there has refused to let the vessel enter port, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> said on Tuesday. It said officials in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> port city decided March 2 not to let the ship dock until they receive additional information about its radiation safeguards. Officials of nearby <LOCATION> Nakhodka </LOCATION> and the northeastern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> region of <PERSON> Magadan </PERSON> also refused port calls after tens of thousands of residents protested to a radio station, the newspaper said. Fractures appeared in the $ 260 million barge carrier soon after it began its maiden voyage Dec. 31 from the <LOCATION> Crimean </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Kerch </LOCATION> to the far eastern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. Experts found that no radiation was released and confirmed its `` atomic heart'' was not damaged, the article said. It did not say how the damage occurred or precisely when the incident happened. According to the newspaper, the ship has good safeguards and could even withstand the crash of a jetliner or a collision with a huge icebreaker, but it added: `` A deficit of information, piled on top of the invisible shadow of the Chernobyl tragedy and the most complex ecological situation in the region, detonated a powerful explosion of public indignation.'' On Saturday, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Vodny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> said a reactor meltdown nearly occurred Nov. 11 on the icebreaker Rossiya while it was docked at the northern port of <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION>. It said operator error was responsible. Public opposition to nuclear power has grown since the explosion and fire April 26, 1986, at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. At least 31 people were killed and the plant spewed radioactivity that eventually spread around the world. Authorities are closing a nuclear power plant in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, a region prone to earthquakes, and have canceled plans to expand other plants. <PERSON> Sovietskaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossiya </PERSON> said the Sevmorput was like a `` sea monster,'' uneconomical because of its size. It said the ship would lose $ 19.3 million this year and $ 22.9 million in 1990. It described the vessel as an `` offended homeless child'' and said every day it is idle costs $ 88,525.

 Chinese employees at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> must remain within 25 miles of midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> when traveling on personal business, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say, citing national security. `` It was just a matter of standardizing the policy, adding <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to a list that includes the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' as well as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. About 100 Chinese citizens are covered by the regulation, which took effect Jan. 26. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other communist countries apply similar restrictions to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government workers in their countries to curb espionage activity. `` Certain travel restrictions are applied for reasons of national security to secretariat and mission personnel from some member states,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` In no way, however, is official travel by or on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> affected,'' she said Tuesday.

 Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, offering a rare glimpse inside the workings of the Kremlin, says reformers began planning changes in the Soviet system two years before <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power. He said planning for perestroika, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of economic and social reform, began in 1983, about the time former <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON> became Soviet leader. `` Even at that time, we had forces who understood that everything was not healthy in our economy,'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> told 33 female journalists gathered in <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catherine </ORGANIZATION>'s Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace on the eve of International Women's Day. <PERSON> Ryzkhov </PERSON>'s frank remarks touched on details of his personal life and frustration with the slow pace of reform. He promised to reveal the long-secret Soviet defense budget in 12 to 18 months, after accountants have arranged it in a form comparable to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> figures, apparently for use in arms negotiations. As part of the plan to shift Soviet spending `` from swords to plowshares,'' defense factories that produce 60 percent military hardware and 40 percent consumer goods will move to a 50-50 ratio by 1991 and 40-60 by 1995, he said. For example, the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Aviation Factory soon will produce pasta, he said. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said he found the slow pace of economic reform the most upsetting part of his job. `` I like to see how the decisions we are taking in the state bodies are implemented in the level of real life,'' he said. That is why he enjoys visiting factories that remind him of the <ORGANIZATION> Ural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine-Building </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION> where his career began, `` to feel the smell of machine parts being manufactured, the smell of real work,'' he said. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> blamed part of the country's problems on corrupt bureaucrats. He also said 40 percent of factory equipment must be replaced. `` We have to make certain investments, we have to have know-how, and we have to have time for that,'' he said. The premier also tackled the notorious shortage of laundry soap. `` In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, we used to sell 80 tons of detergent daily. Now we sell 300 tons daily, and still we have lines for detergent.'' Then he quipped, `` I do n't believe the overall washing has increased all that much.'' He suggested that journalists created a self-fulfilling prophecy by publicizing a soap shortage until people began hoarding even more. To eliminate shortages, he said, wages must stop rising faster than retail trade and productivity. In an unusual discussion of his personal life, <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said he answers his own phone in a 13-hour to 14-hour workday, and continues work at home. As a result, he misses the theater and concerts. The 59-year-old premier said his wife, <PERSON> Ludmila </PERSON>, is a mechanical engineer who designed excavators at the same factory where he rose to director. He said she reads extensively on the countries they visit and works on behalf of orphans. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said his daughter is a law professor at the Academy of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, and her husband also is a lawyer, in the customs office. They have two children, <PERSON> Ludmila </PERSON>, 2, and <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON>, 6. Women already hold 25 percent of the management jobs in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and this should expand under perestroika, <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said. `` Until now, administrative methods were more suited to a man with a loud voice,'' he said. `` Now we have to control the economy not with a shout but with an intellect, and that will allow women to have their say.''

<HEAD>Two Antarctic Islands Really Icebergs, Says Expedition</HEAD>

 A German scientific expedition to <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> says two islands marked on maps since 1961 do not exist and were probably mistaken for huge icebergs, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zealand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The agency said the expedition had gone to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> to collect rock samples from two small islands called the <LOCATION> Terra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Novas </LOCATION>. Despite extensive aerial searches by helicopter and an approach by the expedition's ship, the islands could not be located, the report said. <ORGANIZATION> NZPA </ORGANIZATION> said the expedition recommended the islands be removed from official topographical maps. They were first mapped by an Australian expedition in 1961, the agency said without giving further details.

 Tibetan resentment toward Chinese rule, largely muffled since a failed uprising in 1959, has erupted into violence four times since 1987 in the capital, <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>. The first clash began when police moved in to arrest leaders of a small pro-independence march led by 21 <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks on Sept. 27, 1987. On Oct. 1, 1987, Chinese National Day, about 2,000 Tibetans, angered by the arrests, stormed through the central <LOCATION> Barkhor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, setting fire to a police station, waving the banned <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> flag and stoning police. The Chinese said six policemen were killed and 19 injured. Tibetan and foreign witnesses put the death toll at 14 and said hundreds were injured and arrested. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> blamed the violence on <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s exiled spiritual leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, who days before addressed a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> human rights caucus and called for negotiations on <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s status. On March 5, 1988, the final day of a major prayer festival, a monk stood up during ceremonies at the <ORGANIZATION> Jokhang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> and began shouting for independence. The ensuing violence lasted for two days, with rioters looting and burning shops and setting fire to vehicles. The Chinese said one policemen died when he was stabbed and pushed by Tibetans from a second-floor window, and more than 300 police were wounded. Unconfirmed reports from foreign travelers put the death toll at 24. On Dec. 10, about 30 <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and nuns, some carrying the Tibetan flag, marched into the central square outside the <ORGANIZATION> Jokhang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>. They were commemorating the 40th anniversary of the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights. When crowds surged toward the protesters and began to throw stones at police, police opened fire, killing at least one monk and one child. On Sunday, a small pro-independence demonstration by monks on the anniversary of the March 1988 riots touched off widespread violence. Hundreds of mostly young Tibetans rampaged through the streets, burning and destroying Chinese-owned buildings and property and stoning police. The violence continued and tapered off until the government declared martial law in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> on March 7. By official count, 11 people, including one policeman, died on the 5th, and one more Tibetan was killed the next day. Tibetans said police shot to death scores of people.

 A mayor who was trounced in his bid to become the state's first black congressman since Reconstruction praised his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary opponent, the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, for avoiding racial politics. `` We did not lose tonight. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> won,'' Tuskegee Mayor <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> said after being soundly defeated by Secretary of State <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Browder </PERSON> in Tuesday's runoff. <PERSON> Browder </PERSON>, 46, a former <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor and legislator, swept 12 of the 3rd Congressional District's 13 counties in defeating <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, who won only in predominantly black <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where he lives. The rest of the east <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> district is three-fourths white. With all precincts reporting, <PERSON> Browder </PERSON> had 44,384 votes, or 63 percent, to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s 26,257 votes, or 37 percent. <PERSON> Browder </PERSON> will now face state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, who hopes to give the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> its first congressional gain in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> in a quarter-century. The special election is scheduled for April 4. `` Mayor <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> ran an excellent campaign,'' said <PERSON> Browder </PERSON>. `` He added class to it. The way he campaigned, the way we campaigned, is testimony to his career and his future in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> politics.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, 46, said the Democratic primary, by avoiding virtually any hint of negative racial politics, `` demonstrated to the nation that <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> is on the move.''

 Three new cars, a used car, three pairs of shoes, a pair of pants and half a racehorse were about all <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Malham </PERSON> had time to buy with $ 1 million in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lottery winnings before he died of a heart attack. <PERSON> Malham </PERSON>, a liquor store and lounge owner who died Monday at age 53 of an apparent heart attack, became the first Georgian to win big money in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s lottery. Friends said Tuesday he died a happy man. `` All that money did n't change <PERSON> Jake </PERSON>,'' said R.B. <PERSON> Spriggs </PERSON>, a friend of <PERSON> Malham </PERSON>'s for 30 years. `` It probably relieved him, more than anything else, of financial pressures.'' If anything, <PERSON> Spriggs </PERSON> said, the money only made a nice guy nicer. After he won the Jan. 12 drawing, he bought new cars for himself, his mother and his girlfriend, <PERSON> Joann </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said he bought a used car for his brother and the pants and shoes for himself. After that, he was the `` same old <PERSON> Jake </PERSON>,'' she said. <PERSON> Malham </PERSON> paid off the debts on his property and gave $ 1,000 each to six employees at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and Trust's branch in <LOCATION> Valdosta </LOCATION>. Friends said he had told the employees he'd give them a share if he ever hit the lottery. But <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, another longtime friend, said, `` I think the one thing he was most proud of was that he had paid off everything he owed.'' Even after <PERSON> Malham </PERSON> won the Scratch Three lottery contest, he continued to open his liquor store at 8 a.m. each day, and still lived in the same mobile home. Recently, <PERSON> Malham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Spriggs </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, to watch the running of a horse in which they both owned shares. The horse, Cash Not Silver, won its heat, <PERSON> Spriggs </PERSON> said, and the overjoyed <PERSON> Malham </PERSON> was showing off his trophy at his liquor store the morning of his death. His body was found in his mobile home that afternoon. <PERSON> Spriggs </PERSON> said <PERSON> Malham </PERSON> changed so little that when they traveled together to the dog races in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and the horse races in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, bills were split 50-50 just as if his pal did n't have a fortune `` That was fine with me. I did n't want anything from him, and he knew that,'' <PERSON> Spriggs </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Malham </PERSON> had told <PERSON> Spriggs </PERSON> that of the $ 800,000 he had cleared after taxes, he had invested about $ 600,000 of it in high-yield certificates of deposit, `` so he was n't blowing this money. He knew what he was doing.'' <PERSON> Spriggs </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Malham </PERSON> had battled health problems for much of his life. But they did n't think the excitement of winning the lottery contributed to his death. `` The only time I really worried about his health is when he won it the lottery. I made him sit down, he was so excited,'' <PERSON> Spriggs </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Libya-Controlled Firm Won Defense Work From West Germany, Report
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite warnings from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the government continued to give sensitive defense contracts to a <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> company after <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> bought control of the firm, a news report says. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> bought controlling interest in the <ORGANIZATION> Telemit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1979, <PERSON> Norddeutsche </PERSON> <PERSON> Rundfunk </PERSON>'s `` Panorama'' television magazine reported Tuesday. It said the company specializes in the development of sophisticated military intelligence and communications equipment, including a laser system to measure military target distances. The company helped outfit <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s intelligence network in the 1970s, the report said. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> continued to give military contracts to <ORGANIZATION> Telemit </ORGANIZATION> even after it knew that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> had taken over majority control of the company, the program alleged. The contracts included electronic equipment for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Leopard </ORGANIZATION> tank, it said The government also allowed the company to deliver sophisticated electronic gear to both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> during the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, <PERSON> Panorama </PERSON> said. Panorama said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` expressed its concern over the West German-Libyan connection'' in the early 1980s. But the government ignored concerns that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> could gain access to sensitive government projects through its association with the company, the program said. It said the company was protected by West German intelligence agencies, which used it to gain information about developments in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Winfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkel </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, told the program that military contracts have been suspended until the company is restructured to return it to complete West German control. He acknowledged that the company `` is owned by several holding companies controlled by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dunkel </PERSON> said the company had been given military contracts for years, but said none of the contracts involved secret or highly sensitive technology. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in the mid-1980s demanded that the company `` ensure that no influence could be made by the holding companies on the firm's management.'' But he said the recent allegations that West German companies had been involved in the building of an alleged poison gas factory in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> had prompted the ministry to order the contract suspensions. The <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government was slow in acknowledging and launching investigations into those allegations, which the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had pressed through news media disclosures at the beginning of the year. <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Jungmann </PERSON>, a member of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in federal <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, told Panorama of <ORGANIZATION> Telemit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>: `` The government has known for a long time that the company is 100 percent owned by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. It has received technical know-how from the military that could have been sent on to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>.''

 Strike-bound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is rapidly draining its cash reserves and soon may have to seek bankruptcy protection, auction off its assets or, most likely, sell itself to the highest bidder, analysts say. The possibility of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> filing under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws was heightened Tuesday when the airline said it could n't last until the weekend without its 3,600 pilots, most of whom have refused to cross the picket lines of the striking <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union. Eastern is quickly bleeding the $ 400 million in cash it had on hand at the beginning of the year, and faces large debt payments that could force it to seek protection from its creditors, analysts said. `` They're not forced to declare bankruptcy but they can also see those payments looming in the horizon,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Swelbar </PERSON>, director of industry analysis for <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The option that analysts see as most likely, however, would be an outright sale of the 60-year-old carrier. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> already has discussed buying Eastern. Analysts place a purchase price anywhere from $ 400 million plus debt payments to $ 900 million for ailing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which lost $ 335.4 million last year, nearly double its 1987 loss. Analysts doubt that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, planned to thrust <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy when the Machinists strike began Saturday. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> used bankruptcy filing as a way to break the union contracts at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> bought that airline in 1983. `` I think the game plan was to force this thing to a showdown and hopefully get the pilots across the picket line, basically undoing the Machinists,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. But the pilots' decision to honor the strike may have thrown a wrench into <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s strategy. A federal judge Tuesday refused to order the pilots back into the cockpit. Most of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s cash _ an estimated $ 350 million _ represents money that customers paid in advance for tickets that now must be refunded or transfered to competitors that honor the tickets. The money will dwindle within several weeks, according to analysts. With limited flights, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which did about $ 10 million in daily business before the strike, has few advance bookings and no revenue. So it must drain cash reserves to pay wages, overhead and debt. Eastern could get a cash transfusion from the pending $ 365 million sale of its profitable <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle _ one of two <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> operations still running _ to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. Eastern says the strike has not affected the deal, which awaits final federal approval. Repayment of debt associated with the sale and a required pension fund payment would leave Eastern with about $ 210 million. `` If they do n't get the proceeds from the shuttle I would say they'd have to declare bankruptcy by the end of the month,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Baggaley </PERSON>, an airline bond analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a major Wall Street credit-rating agency `` If they do, they could probably survive another month or two and try to sell more operations and more assets,'' he said. `` But the prospects are n't good no matter what happens.'' Despite shutting down most of its operations and laying off 9,500 non-union workers this week, analysts estimate <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has an operating cash loss of at least $ 2 million a day for payments ranging from leasing airport ticket counters to paying 1,500 remaining employees. But should <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> file for protection, he would have a tougher time abrogating the unions' contracts than he did at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. As a result of 1985 amendments to the bankruptcy laws, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> first would have to negotiate further with the Eastern unions and demonstrate that he had no alternative before firing the workers. Another option would be for Eastern to auction its planes, airport gates, routes and landing rights to other airlines in a liquidation under Chapter 7 of federal bankruptcy laws.

 Suspected Tamil separatists killed a moderate Tamil politician in eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> today, just one day before he was to take his seat in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, authorities said. In the capital, suspected anti-government radicals burst into a research laboratory and shot and killed the former vice chancellor of <ORGANIZATION> Colombo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, police said. <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Samkpanthamurthy </PERSON> was walking to the rice paddies near his home in the village of <LOCATION> Kakudha </LOCATION> when he was gunned down by two men on a motorcycle, the military said. <LOCATION> Kakudha </LOCATION> is about 135 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The military blamed his killing on the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest and most militant Tamil group waging a nearly 6-year-old insurgency for a separate nation. <PERSON> Samkpanthamurthy </PERSON>, a leading member of the moderate <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, was chosen to take one of the 10 <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> seats won by the party during the Feb. 15 general election. The governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will control 125 of the 225 seats. In the capital, four men burst into the College House across from <ORGANIZATION> Colombo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and fatally shot Professor <PERSON> Stanly </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijesundera </PERSON>, police said. The 65-year-old professor of biochemistry had served as vice-chancellor of the university for more than 11 years. <PERSON> Wijesundera </PERSON> retired four months ago and had been working on a research project, university officials said. Police blamed Sinhalese radicals for the killing. They said the professor's slaying may have been to protest plans by President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s government to reopen seven universities that were closed over the last two years because of student unrest. Government officials have said the unrest was fueled by militants of the ethnic Sinhalese majority, who oppose government efforts to grant minority Tamils greater autonomy. The only university currently operating is in the northern town of <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION>. The government earlier announced that the seven universities would reopen on March 2, but postponed the date without giving any reason. The students have been protesting the detention of colleagues who had opposed an India-sponsored 1987 peace accord aimed at the Tamil insurgency in the island's north and east provinces. Sinhalese radicals said the accord grants too many concessions to the Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the country's 16 million people. They say they are denied jobs, education and money for development by the Sinhalese, who are predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION>, make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and military. Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, are a majority in the north and east, and militant Tamils have been demanding an independent homeland in those provinces.

 A close associate of four-term socialist Mayor <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> was elected to succeed him, and he promised to carry on <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' `` fight for the rights of ordinary people.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON>, 39, <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' community development director, easily defeated Aldermen President <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chioffi </PERSON>, a Democrat, in Tuesday's election. With all precincts reporting, <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> drew 5,626 votes, or 53 percent, to <PERSON> Chioffi </PERSON>'s 4,400, or 42 percent. A `` tax revolt'' candidate and one from the environmentalist Greens party split the rest of the vote. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, the nation's only socialist mayor, had decided to teach and write rather than serve another two-year term. <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> shies away from the socialist label, but ran under the banner of <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' third-party <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> `` What the people have said today is that Progressive government is good government and they want more of it,'' <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> told about 150 supporters. He said he would continue to push most of <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' platform, which includes affordable housing and public access to the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Champlain </LOCATION> waterfront He said voters wanted an administration that would continue the `` fight for the rights of ordinary people. It's a fight for the rights of tenants, it's a fight for housing for the homeless, it's a fight for decent jobs for everyone in this economy.'' <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, 47, said <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON>'s victory was proof that the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> was n't his `` one-man show. It's a movement. That's what we accomplished tonight.'' `` There is one city in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that has said we can go beyond status quo politics, we can talk real issues to the people, we can have a dream of a city and a state and country that is fundamentally different than it is now,'' said <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, who ran unsuccessfully for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last fall. Voters, however, did n't pass two referenda backed by the coalition that would have set up new taxes to pay for a $ 1.25 million childcare program. Elsewhere around <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> Tuesday was Town Meeting Day, and residents braved sub-zero temperatures to travel to their town halls, approve school budgets and socialize with friends and neighbors not seen for a year. In more than 80 towns, residents voted on a non-binding resolution asking the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to reinstate the death penalty, last used in the 1950s. At least 54 towns supported capital punishment, but nearly 30 rejected or tabled it. One town that voted down the resolution cited the recent film, `` The Thin Blue Line,'' which suggests that an innocent man faced the death penalty in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Two years ago, about 30 towns took up the question, and two-thirds voted for reinstatement. But most town meeting debates were over local issues. Residents in the central <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Plainfield </LOCATION> applauded their town road crew, but residents in neighboring <LOCATION> Marshfield </LOCATION> lost patience when people could n't agree on whether to replace an old bridge. Pointing a crooked finger at a long-winded neighbor, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goslant </PERSON> said, `` Why keep arguing over a damn old bridge? ... Why keep arguing over something that do n't amount to nothing?'' When <PERSON> Goslant </PERSON> spoke, at mid-afternoon, the town was averaging an hour to debate each article on the 27-article warning.

 Police found guns and plastic explosives hidden in a forest near a building where Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is to address a <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference next week, authorities said. The weapons were found near the <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Scalby </LOCATION>, about two miles from <LOCATION> Scarborough </LOCATION>, where the governing Conservatives are to gather. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> survived an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb attack on Oct. 12, 1984 that killed five people during the Conservatives' annual convention at the coast resort of <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>. The blast partly demolished the hotel in which she was staying. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> police, who are responsible for the <LOCATION> Scarborough </LOCATION> area, said they saw no reason to recommend cancellation of the March 17-18 conference of the Conservatives' national council at <ORGANIZATION> Scarborough </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The deputy chief constable of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Morritt </PERSON>, told a news conference on Tuesday that he could not discount a link between the arms cache and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s planned visit to <PERSON> Scarborough </PERSON>. Police said the cache of guns, ammunition and Czechoslovak-made Semtex explosive was found Monday in a forest clearing beside a road. It was unearthed by accident by a man gathering leaf mold for his garden, police said. Police did not reveal how many weapons were found, but said the amount of Semtex was substantial. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> said 25 pounds of the plastic explosive was found. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bomb disposal experts say Semtex is frequently used in <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombs. The British government has repeatedly accused <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> of supplying the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> with arms and Semtex in retaliation for Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s backing of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing raids against <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in April 1986. She gave permission for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes to fly from <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> bases to take part in the attack. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> vowed unspecified revenge against <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> shortly after the raids. He has frequently expressed support for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, which is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The mainly Roman Catholic <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> wants to unite predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> with the Republic of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Morrit on Tuesday called on owners of hotels and guest houses in the <LOCATION> Scarborough </LOCATION> area to tell police about any recent visitors who had given cause for concern. Also Tuesday, masked gunmen killed three men at a village gas station in the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Coagh </LOCATION>, 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility in a statement to the local news media and said the service station was a stronghold of the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> paramilitary group that also is banned. Police said the three men slain in <LOCATION> Coagh </LOCATION>, who were chatting when the gunment drove up and opened fire, had no connection with <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s security forces.

 Doctors who treated transplant patient <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON>, whose story touched millions after she received the heart of a boy who had a crush on her, were stunned by her death. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> was three weeks from her 18th birthday and was waiting for a second transplant when she died Tuesday at her home in <LOCATION> Patterson </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON>, who recently said she wanted to become a nurse, died during a midday nap, according to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center. She had received the heart of 15-year-old <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> three years ago at the medical center. Although the transplant initially was a success, her body last year began to reject <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON>'s heart, which he willed to his ailing friend before a blood vessel in his brain burst and he died suddenly. Dr. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON>, her pediatric cardiologist, said she was in `` pretty good shape'' when doctors examined her last week. `` She was a wonderful little girl and her death shocks and saddens us all,'' <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> told reporters. `` We truly admired her resiliency and ability to cope with things that young girls should n't have to cope with.'' Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schorr </PERSON>, her family physician, and others praised her cheerfulness, courage and attempts to live the life of a normal teen-ager during her nearly four-year battle for life. `` She had been through a lot of stress and discomfort, physically and emotionally. She really kept her spirits up remarkably well,'' <PERSON> Schorr </PERSON> said. Although there was no official determination of the cause of death, doctors suspected cardiac arrythmia, the irregular beating of the heart, a problem often found in transplant patients. Her chances would have been excellent with another transplant, <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON>'s parents declined to talk with reporters. Their daughter was thrust into the limelight when it was reported that <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON>, who once had a crush on his high school classmate, told his parents he wanted to leave the ailing 14-year-old girl his heart after his death. `` I'm going to die and I'm going to give my heart to my girlfriend,'' <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> told his mother in December 1985. <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON>, the son of farm laborers, had been suffering from blackouts and headaches when he talked about donating his heart to <PERSON> Donna </PERSON>. He died suddenly on Jan. 4, 1986. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON>, whose own heart had been critically damaged by a virus, received his heart the next day. `` I hope that what Peno -LRB- <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> -RRB- did shows how people can help each other,'' <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> said 12 days after the transplant. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> became an instant celebrity. She was featured in People magazine, visited with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and accepted an invitation from rock star <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to visit him in his home near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Monkey Vaccine May Help In Search For AIDS Vaccine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers have developed a vaccine to protect monkeys against infection by a virus that is a distant relative of the AIDS virus, according to a report published today. At least three more years of research are needed before the vaccine can be tested on humans, but scientists say the finding could help in the search for an AIDS vaccine, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times reported. `` I think it is going to be a source of great excitement in the neurological and virological communities,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. The vaccine, developed at <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, protected a group of macaque monkeys against a virus called HTLV-1, which causes a rare form of leukemia and has been linked to other diseases. HTLV-1 is a member of an unusual family of viruses called retroviruses, which include the AIDS virus. Insights gained in the monkey research may show scientists which components of the AIDS virus must be present in a vaccine, said <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> pathobiologist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>. The HTLV-1 virus, discovered in the early 1980s by virologist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, causes adult T-cell leukemia and lymphoma, and has been linked to multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus, erythematosus and other rare neurological conditions. The virus is spread by the exchange of bodily fluids, in the same manner as the AIDS virus. Infection by the HTLV-1 virus is endemic among intravenous drug users in some Eastern urban areas. The Olsen group developed the virus by building on information learned in the successful search for a virus to protect house cats against infection by a retrovirus that causes feline leukemia, the No. 1 killer of domestic cats. Neither the cat nor monkey vaccines contain the virus itself, but parts of proteins secreted by animal cells that were infected with the virus. <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> said that the protein finding was important in AIDS research because most potential AIDS vaccines being developed only use one type of protein and thus probably will be less effective. `` More than one protein is going to be necessary'' for an AIDS vaccine, he said. Some of <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>'s vaccinated monkeys have gone as long as two years without showing any traces of infection, but <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> and other scientists note that the HTLV-1 virus can remain hidden for two to four decades before triggering an infection. <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>, who reported his findings at a recent meeting on retroviruses, is studying the long-term impact of the vaccine by using sophisticated genetic engineering techniques to search for traces of infection in vaccinated monkeys.

<HEAD>`Run for Your Wife!,' A British Farce, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 `` Run for Your Wife!'' gives <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> theatergoers a chance to see an authentic production of a British sex farce without having to cross the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. Whether they would want to is another question entirely. The play, which opened Tuesday at Broadway's <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Theater, is full of leers, lunges and lame sex jokes. It could bring back celibacy. `` Run for Your Wife!'' stars <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON>, who also wrote and directed. He strikes out on all three counts. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON> is sort of a one-man play industry. His other successful efforts there include such supposedly spicy concoctions as `` Not Now, Darling,'' `` Move Over, Mrs. <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>,'' `` Why Not Stay for Breakfast?'' and `` Two Into One.'' The titles are better than the plays. The plot of `` Run for Your Wife!'' spins out of control early. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON>, is a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> taxi cab driver. He has one wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Wimbledon </LOCATION>, and another, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Streatham </LOCATION>. Both of their tacky apartments, by set supervisor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Anania </PERSON>, are on stage simultaneously. You can tell them apart because one is blue, the other yellow. His wives are color-coded to match the apartments. One wears blue, the other yellow. That's the extent of their characterizations. When <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> saves a little old lady from a mugging and gets beaten up, his twin living arrangements unravel. Most of the evening is spent trying to prevent one wife from finding out about the other. With one glorious exception, the acting is cardboard _ flat and gray. Only <PERSON> Paxton </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, as a well-meaning but bumbling neighbor, manages to rise above the drivel. He actually seems to believe what he is saying. That's no small accomplishment considering <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON>'s inane dialogue. The second act trades boring for offensive. It bashes homosexuals with some crude jokes, primarily focused on one limp-wristed character who wears a lavender jumpsuit in case you ca n't figure out his sexual preference. The play has none of the style or wit of `` Lend Me a Tenor,'' another farce which arrived last week. In fact, it makes that harmless trifle seem like <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coward </PERSON>. `` ` Run for Your Wife!'' is one of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s biggest hits. It has clocked more than 2,500 performances and shows no sign of slowing down. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it should expire quickly. In other reviews, <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gussow </PERSON> wrote in The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Times: `` Accepting the ground rules for allowable contrivances in farce, the play is still burdened with blind alleys, limp jokes, forced puns and troubled entendres.'' `` ` Run For Your Wife' is what is known in the trade as an Audience Show,'' wrote <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` What this means is that it is so witless and inane that no self-respecting critic can possibly endorse it, but audiences enjoy it tremendously.'' `` The premises of the joke are ramshackle, its convolutions arbitrary and its conclusion quite remarkably inconclusive,'' wrote <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` The results are shabby, with the actors busting a gut for laughs, rather like a TV sitcom going down for the third time without a script.''

<HEAD>Lawyer: Award Sets Record For AIDS Suits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man who said he contracted AIDS from blood products during heart surgery in 1985 will collect the largest settlement for anyone who has contracted the deadly syndrome, his attorney said. Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Habush </PERSON> said Monday that his client, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, avoided an appeals battle over a $ 3.9 million jury award because of the settlement. The amount was not disclosed, but <PERSON> Habush </PERSON> said it was `` very favorable and still very much a record in dollars in AIDS cases.'' The largest previous award is believed to be $ 1.6 millon for an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> man who contracted AIDS from a blood product that promotes clotting. That verdict was later overturned on grounds the evidence was insufficient to prove negligence by the laboratory that provided the product. A <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> jury in December awarded $ 750,000 to the family of a 5-year-old who contracted the virus from blood he received during a heart operation in 1983. And in February a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> jury awarded <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s lover, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, $ 21.75 million because <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> failed to tell him he had AIDS. The case increased the responsibility of AIDS sufferers to tell sexual companions of their plight. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> wanted his case resolved quickly so that he could decide how the money would be used, including what charities he would support, before he died. The 63-year-old man testified during the trial that he expected to live no more than one year. A <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury had awarded the suburban <LOCATION> Brookfield </LOCATION> man $ 3.9 million in damages in December, but attorneys said appeals could have taken years. The man had filed suit against the <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>, which provided blood products used during his operation. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON>, the blood center's lawyer, said the case was settled to both sides' satisfaction. `` The blood center remains confident that it was not negligent and that there was no liability in this case at all,'' he said. The plaintiff argued the center was negligent for distributing blood products that were n't tested for the AIDS virus even though it had tested products on hand. The blood center's attorneys said that, at the time, they could not be sure of the reliability of AIDS tests and were reluctant to replace untested blood with tested blood. The plaintiff received the blood April 23, 1985, six weeks after the blood center began testing blood for the AIDS virus. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, breaks down the body's immune system and leaves the victim open to outbreaks of other diseases. No cure is known. It is spread through sexual contact, transfusions of blood and blood products, and the sharing of contamined hypodermic needles or syringes by drug abusers.

<TEXT>
 A storm that deposited snow, ice and 450 stranded motorists on this tiny town overnight, nearly doubling its population, did n't strain <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> hospitality as residents opened their homes, churches and cupboards to the beleaguered. `` I've never seen an outpouring of kindness like this,'' said <PERSON> Donny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohrbach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, who like hundreds of others pulled into Valley View to escape icy roads south of the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> border during a massive winter storm. He and his mother, <PERSON> Norma </PERSON>, spent Monday night in a pew at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> here. `` These are the loveliest people,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rohrbach </PERSON> said. In less than 12 hours, at least 450 stranded motorists poured into <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> View </LOCATION>, located about 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, to escape nearly a foot of ice piled on the highway. They packed homes, all four churches and the high school gymnasium before spilling out into the town square and nearly every side street to huddle in their parked rigs and trailers. Many of the town's 575 residents offered cots and blankets, donuts and milk or heartier fare. They opened their homes, ventured onto a treacherous highway to rescue the stranded, then stayed up all night to see them fed and sheltered. `` Most of these people pass by here all the time and now Valley View will hold some special memories for them,'' said <PERSON> Melodiee </PERSON> <PERSON> Blevins </PERSON>, who helped house and feed 125 storm-weary travelers at the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, where her husband, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON>, is pastor. `` I do n't think they'll forget us,'' she said. Elsewhere in the nation, others were not so fortunate. Thirty people have died since the weekend as the huge storm cut a swath from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, leaving up to 16 inches of snow before blowing across the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seaboard </LOCATION> into the ocean. Storm warnings have been issued on the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coastal waters south of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, and 1 to 2 inches of rain flooded several roads. Residents of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, meanwhile, kept a wary eye on the rain-swollen <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> asked federal officials for a disaster declaration for four northwest <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> counties after snow and ice crushed 280 poultry houses, leaving up to $ 35 million in damage and dead birds. In all, the storm destroyed as many as 700 poultry houses in a four-state area, causing what could be the single biggest disaster ever to hit the poultry industry, said <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Simmons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Siloam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, Ark. Poultry operations in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> also were hit hard. As it moved east, the storm knocked out electricity temporarily to 40,000 customers in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, and thousands more in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. In Valley View, however, the worst was over today, although an icy slush on Interstate 35 continued to cause traffic slowdowns near the Texas-Oklahoma border. `` It's kind of a let down after Monday night,'' Ms. <PERSON> Blevins </PERSON> said. `` It added a lot of excitement to a small town.''

<HEAD>Guilty Verdict in `Ski Mask Rapist' Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note contents of last graf.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man convicted of being the `` ski mask rapist'' in the sexual assaults of 26 women is virtually assured of spending the rest of his life in prison, a prosecutor said. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, a 27-year-old former city sewer worker, was found guilty Tuesday of 117 of 136 charges stemming from the assaults. `` If I just look at the violent sexual offenses, I can see that he's looking at more than 500 years in prison,'' prosecutor <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Disregarding appeals, <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> would have to serve at least half his sentence before being eligible for parole. `` We have a number of victims here who were greatly traumatized. There can be no doubt justice has been done,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Teilh </PERSON> set sentencing for April 25. <PERSON> Teilh </PERSON> said he had carefully reviewed preliminary hearing transcripts and found no doubt that <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> was guilty of most of the counts filed against him. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> agreed Friday to let the judge declare a verdict based on the transcripts, which included testimony from the victims. <PERSON> Teilh </PERSON> dismissed 19 charges. Police reports said <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> usually stalked his victims before accosting them and often tied them up, sexually assaulting them, then taking cash, jewelry or automatic bank-teller cards. The rapes occurred in both homes and offices and one woman was attacked in a church confessional. The assailant usually wore a ski mask and often threatened his victims with a knife or pellet gun that closely resembled a .45 - caliber `` I've killed before, and I'll kill again,'' he warned them, according to the police reports. When <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> was arrested Dec. 16, 1987, police discovered a ski mask, a black pellet gun and a hooded sweat shirt in his car. Several victims said their assailant had worn such a mask and shirt. The charges against <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> involved attacks from 1985 to 1987 on <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> women ranging in age from 16 to 84. Teilh found <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> guilty on 22 counts each of rape, burglary, and robbery. He also found <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> guilty of 23 oral copulation charges, six assaults with intent to commit rape, 17 sexual batteries, four instances of sodomy and one count of penetration with a foreign object.

<HEAD>Conservative Group Moving To Sen. McCarthy's Hometown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>APPLETON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> plans to move its headquarters to this northeastern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> town, but Mayor <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said she doubts it will give the community an image problem. <PERSON> Appleton </PERSON> already is known for its links to the late Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> _ annual memorial services are held at his gravesite in town and a large bust of him is in the <LOCATION> Outagamie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION>. The town also holds the annual <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON> seance, in honor of the famed magician who grew up in town. `` That says our city has a variety of ideas, and is n't it wonderful we can permit within our social network the whole range of ideas,'' Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. The conservative organization will close its headquarters in <LOCATION> Belmont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and consolidate operations in <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION> beginning in July, the group said in the March issue of the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bulletin </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a real opportunity here in terms of potential growth and the economic impact of it all,'' said <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bubolz </PERSON>, an <PERSON> Appleton </PERSON> insurance executive who became the society's chief executive officer in November. The headquarters will start with a staff of 27 people and a payroll of roughly $ 1 million, <PERSON> Bubolz </PERSON> said. The society said <PERSON> Appleton </PERSON> also was nearer the geographical center of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and noted its connections to <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, the Republican senator who chaired hearings into alleged communist activities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1950s. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, who was later censured by his colleagues, was born in nearby <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chute </LOCATION>. The society is a conservative political organization that emphasizes fighting the spread of communism and reducing the size of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. It claims more than 10,000 members. City Attorney <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Carman </PERSON> did n't share the mayor's views, saying the move was unfortunate for the community. But he said he would not advocate any attempt to prevent it. <PERSON> Carman </PERSON> said he feared that the <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> bust, the annual services for <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> would present a false image of the people of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The army shut down an illegal Jewish settlement today, turning out a small group of Israelis who pitched a tent on the hilltop site in an attempt to launch a new community. The bid to create another Jewish enclave in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> followed a rally attended by 10,000 people in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> whose organizers called for the founding of eight such settlements. Elswhere in the occupied lands today, Palestinians staged a general strike to mark the 15-month anniversary of their uprising. Seven Arabs were shot and wounded during clashes with troops in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials said. The army said it was checking the reports. Palestinian women staged pro-PLO demonstrations in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jalla </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to mark International Women's Day The latest leaflet issued by underground leaders of the uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation praised women for their `` heroic role ... in the liberation war.'' In east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police imposed a curfew on the Arab Isawiye section and rounded up men suspected of involvement in recent protests, police said. At least 15 Palestinians were arrested, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. After Tuesday night's rally in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, a group of would-be settlers set out for the site of a proposed settlement called Ofarim. The site is about 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> on land occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since it was captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The government's coalition agreement calls for setting up eight settlements, but final approval has not been granted. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, controlled by the left-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, says the country can not afford the new settlements. Two army jeeps blocked the entrance to the Ofarim site this morning. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official who demanded anonymity said eight activists from the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Betar </ORGANIZATION> youth movement had set up a tent at the site during the night but later left at the order of soldiers. `` It was a symbolic takeover of the land. When the army came, they left voluntarily,'' said <PERSON> Yaakov </PERSON> <PERSON> Narodetsky </PERSON>, general secretary of <PERSON> Bet </PERSON> <PERSON> Aryeh </PERSON>, a settlement about one mile from the Ofarim site. Other hopeful settlers last night drove three large mobile homes out to another Jewish community, <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horon </LOCATION>, and said they planned to move out to the proposed new settlement of <PERSON> Talmon </PERSON> later in the week. More than 70,000 Jewish settlers coexist uneasily with 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, maintaining more than 130 settlements. Many are dedicated to continuing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s control of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Settlers have called for moving even more Jews out to the territories to strengthen <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s hold on the land. <PERSON> Elyakim </PERSON> <PERSON> Haetzni </PERSON>, an activist in the settlement movement, said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s state-run radio station this morning that the settlers would oppose any peace settlement that called for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s withdrawal from the territories `` The state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> can not turn Jews out of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Haetzni </PERSON> said. Palestinians throughout the occupied territories began a general strike to mark the 15th month of the revolt that began Dec. 8, 1987. At least 391 Palestinians and 17 Israelis have been killed in the uprising.

<HEAD>Jewish Women Begin Hunger Strikes to Protest Emigration Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly 50 Jewish women across the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> began a three-day hunger strike today to protest what they say are arbitrary policies that bar their emigration, a participant said. It is the third year in a row that <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refusal </ORGANIZATION>, whose members have been denied exit visas, have held a hunger strike beginning on International Women's Day, a Soviet holiday celebrated on March 8. `` These three hunger strikes have all been during the years of perestroika. Everyone talks a lot about all the changes due to perestroika, but the situation in emigration is still the same,'' said hunger strike organizer <PERSON> Inna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ioffe </PERSON>, who first applied for an exit visa 10 years ago. Perestroika is what President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> calls his reform program. The women are protesting Soviet emigration procedures and calling on Soviet leaders to set up a judicial system to review their cases. About half of the 46 women participating in the hunger strike have been refused emigration for reasons of state secrecy, <PERSON> Ioffe </PERSON> said. Soviet authorities have told them they can not leave because they or their relatives have knowledge of state secrets, she said. The other half have been denied emigration because their parents or divorced spouses have failed to certify that they have no financial claims on the would-be emigrants, she said. Women in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Irkutsk </LOCATION> and other cities were participating in the hunger strike, <PERSON> Ioffe </PERSON> said. `` We have no laws to lean on, and we are never given reasonable reasons for the refusals,'' she said. <PERSON> Ioffe </PERSON> said she has been told she can not emigrate because her 76-year-old mother-in-law, who also wants to emigrate, was exposed to state secrets in her work as a botanist. More than 20,000 Soviet Jews were allowed permission to emigrate in 1988. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Semenovsky </PERSON>, who has sought in vain for three years to obtain a Soviet exit visa, said at a recent <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> demonstration of the so-called Jewish refuseniks that 80,000 others have had applications refused. The majority of the women who participated in the 1988 and 1987 hunger strikes have now emigrated, said <PERSON> Ioffe </PERSON>, who also took part in those hunger strikes.

<HEAD>Izvestia Says Soviet AIDS Cases Rising Fast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 AIDS is spreading at an alarming rate in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, with the number of infected or ill people forecast to increase nearly tenfold next year, the government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> says. The newspaper quoted the health minister, <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON>, as saying AIDS now poses no less a danger to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> than nuclear weapons. `` The alarming situation with AIDS demands rapid and decisive measures,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday night in the latest of a series of reports in the Soviet press expressing growing concern about the deadly disease. The Soviets once claimed acquired immune deficiency syndrome was strictly a Western problem caused by decadent capitalist sexual mores and drug use. Homosexuals and intravenous drug users are two of the groups at greatest risk. Soviet papers once even claimed AIDS was the result of a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> experiment in biological warfare. Soviet scientists since have debunked such claims, saying their country needs to mobilize more resources to fight the spread of the disease, which saps the body's natural defenses and leaves it open to onslaught by other ailments. According to <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, however, the AIDS virus is spreading at an alarming rate among Soviets. In 1988, the paper said, 81 people in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were carriers of the AIDS virus. By Feb. 1, it said, 44 more cases were known and now the total number of people infected with the virus is more than 140. `` It's expected that next year, there will be 1,342 sick people,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said, apparently referring to carriers of the virus, rather than people actually suffering symptoms. Of four Soviets actually suffering AIDS symptoms, three have died to date, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. The government newspaper, reporting on a meeting of a special Soviet commission created to fight epidemics, quoted <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON> as saying warnings to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> that AIDS could become a national calamity had been ignored. `` The threat that we face is no less than the ecological ` bomb' or nuclear weapons,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON> as saying `` He also stated that workers of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> on numerous occasions tried to inform the government that the situation was menacing. But noted scientists dealing with the problem eliminated the acuteness of the question, saying it was all a false alarm.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had 86,157 AIDS victims as of last month, according to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>.

 The Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON>, an innovative Scottish churchman, and West German physicist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Freidrich </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> today were named winners of the 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Templeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prize </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> in Religion. The prize, amounting this year to $ 435,000, is the world's biggest and is deliberately kept larger than Nobel prizes in the sciences and literature This is the first time in the award's 16 years that it has been divided between two winners, a result of rankings by an international panel of judges, a spokesman said. <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON>, 92, of <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, was chosen for his founding of the famed <ORGANIZATION> Iona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, an ecumenical center of prayer, peacemaking and work that has influenced church life in many countries. <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON>, 76, of <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, was named for initiating dialogue between the disciplines of science and religion and for research into links between physics, cosmology and theology. <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON> said in a statement he would use half of the money for direct action against hunger and the other half for work for peace. <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> layman and the brother of West German President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON>, said his share would go to deepening relationships between science and faith. The winners were announced at a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Templeton </PERSON>, American investment counselor and financier, who founded the prize in 1972. He said its purpose is to encourage inter-religious understanding and to help `` people in all nations to grow spiritually in their love of God and understanding of God.'' Previous winners have included the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> nun <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and the Russian-expatriate writer <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> is the second scientist to win the prize. The Rev. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaki </PERSON>, an astrophysicist at <ORGANIZATION> Seton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, won two years ago. Choice of last year's winner, <PERSON> Inamullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, was temporarily delayed after some Jewish leaders alleged he had links to anti-Semitism. But the award subsequently was made after an inquiry found the criticisms unjustified. The nine judges for the competition this year included former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Catholic </PERSON> <PERSON> Archishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>. <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON>, a Church of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> clergyman, left a wealthy parish to minister to shipbuilding workers and their families in <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>. In 1938, he founded the ecumenical community on the isle of <LOCATION> Iona </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s west coast. With its simple monastic-style commitment to a fivefold rule of daily prayer and Scripture study, tithing, peacemaking, and responsible work, the community has drawn interest of Christians around the world. About 100,000 visit there annually to experience its methods first-hand as a model for religious renewal, peace and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> unity. <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON>, who had become a pacifist after witnessing the slaughter of World War I as a military captain, also founded an early peace organization, the <ORGANIZATION> Fellowship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconciliation </ORGANIZATION>, which now has branches in most countries. He stepped down in 1967 as leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Iona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, which has about 200 resident members and thousands of supporter elsewhere. Elevated to the British <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION>, he continues a broad schedule of teaching. <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> was cited as pioneering `` the development of the inter-relationships of physics, cosmology and theology'' and laying `` the groundwork for the renewal of faith.'' An astrophysicist, his research into cosmology led him after World War II to initiate conversations between scientists and theologians, originally in 1949 at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gottingen </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and later elsewhere. Such conversations spread to other countries in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, resulting in an international conference in 1978 on science and faith sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON>, who has written about 40 books on physics, astronomy, cosmology and religion, has taught at universities of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Stasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gottingen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. He recently retired as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Max </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Starnberg </LOCATION>, a position he held since 1970.

<HEAD>Court Says Spectators Can Take Notes in American's Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today that spectators may take notes during most trials, and an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lawyer who brought the case said the decision would help open the Japanese legal system to needed reform. Until today's ruling, only reporters for major newspapers and radio and television stations were allowed to take notes during most trials. The decision came in a case brought by <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Repeta </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> attorney denied permission to take notes at a tax trial in 1983-84. Although it ruled in his favor, the court said <PERSON> Repeta </PERSON>'s inability to take notes during the trial was not serious enough to warrant paying the $ 10,000 damages he demanded. While attending the tax trial as part of research for a book on Japanese law, <PERSON> Repeta </PERSON>, 38, was repeatedly refused permission to take notes. With support from the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, he lodged a complaint, which was rejected by <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` As of today, anyone can go into any courtroom in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and will be allowed to take notes,'' <PERSON> Repeta </PERSON> said today. `` In a democracy, people have to have free access to the courts, or they ca n't be satisfied that the criminal process is being used fairly.'' <PERSON> Repeta </PERSON> told reporters there were `` very serious violations of fundamental human rights principles'' in Japanese criminal trials, including the holding of suspects for long periods without bail and without access to a lawyer. In the tax case, <PERSON> Repeta </PERSON> observed, the defendant was held for 2 -LCB- years without bail. `` The best remedy for such problems is public knowledge of what goes on in the courtroom,'' he said. In a rare appearance by a foreigner before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Repeta </PERSON> told the judges in a January hearing that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> now has a responsibility to set an international legal example. `` The world looks to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to take a leadership role, not only in economics but also in the cultural and political fields,'' he said. About 30 Japanese supported Repeta in the case, including lawyers, reporters and writers. His Japanese lawyer, <PERSON> Yoichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitamura </PERSON>, said it took an American to bring the case `` because Japanese are accustomed to the fact that spectators are not allowed to take notes.'' In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s controversial `` press club'' system, most government agencies maintain semi-official press clubs that generally exclude reporters from small newspapers and magazines, and foreign correspondents. Until today's ruling, only members of judiciary press clubs were allowed to take notes during most trials. Members of press clubs still do not have access to court documents.

 Police dragged people from their homes in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, the Tibetan capital, today as troops converged on the city to enforce martial law after three days of anti-Chinese rioting, witnesses said. Foreigners were given a day to leave the remote southern city. An Australian traveler told of security forces in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> pulling Tibetans out of their homes: `` One or two people were screaming really frantically as they were being taken away into a truck. `` The truck kept coming back,'' he said. `` They would pick up a couple people, drive off with a half dozen militia holding them down, then come back.'' The Australian, speaking by telephone, said he saw police leading away another group of 12 to 14 youths, some of whom looked as young as nine. An American tourist said thousands of soldiers occupied the old section of the city, where Tibetans protesting Chinese rule began rioting Sunday, stoning police and building bonfires of goods looted from Chinese-owned stores. Official reports have put the death toll in the violence at 12, although Tibetans say far more have been killed, most shot to death by security frces. At midnight Tuesday, trucks with loudspeakers began announcing the city was under martial law and that Tibetans should stay indoors. Dozens of trucks packed with soldiers later entered the city. Chinese authorities said the entire city would be `` cordoned off.'' Anyone `` who defies martial law or instigates others to do so will be severely punished,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. It was the first time <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has publicly imposed martial law anywhere since the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. It marked an escalation in the battle with <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> protesters, who demand freedom from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the return of their spiritual leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, who fled to exile in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> after a filed uprising 30 years ago. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s government-in-exile today offered to hold talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities to discuss <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s future `` Despite the current tragic events, we are still ready to hold talks with the Chinese so that a peaceful solution can be found,'' said <PERSON> Tashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Wongdi </PERSON>, the Tibetan leader's chief representative in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. The two sides have agreed to meet to discuss the Tibetan situation but have been unable to agree on a location. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also refuses to discuss the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s proposal for greater autonomy for <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. Troops were not deployed in three previous outbreaks of violence over the past 18 months that claimed the lives of about 40 Tibetans and police. One American said that after martial law was declared, `` The Tibetans who'd been marching around were still angry. They felt frustrated. Others were scared. I saw grown men bursting into tears.'' <PERSON> Doje </PERSON> <PERSON> Cering </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> Autonomous Government, was quoted on national radio today as saying separatists had taken <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s restrained stance toward past demonstrations as a sign of weakness `` Now is the time for a radical solution. If we do n't adopt that now, it will seriously influence our social stability.'' Travelers said police entered one hotel at 2:30 a.m. and another an hour later and announced that all foreigners must leave <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> by noon Thursday. About 80 foreigners were believed to be in the city. `` It's basically a choice between heading for the <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> border and flying to <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>,'' the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION>, one traveler said. `` But they wo n't let us out to go to the bank or prepare.'' One American traveler said most of the Tibetans wounded in the clashes have been hiding in their homes. `` It's presumed that anybody who got shot must be guilty,'' he said. Foreigners said security forces were checking identifications of both the few Tibetans and Chinese out on the streets. There were no reports of demonstrations or gunfire today. All foreigners spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Three Swedes who took photographs of Sunday's initial clash in the central square were given back their cameras and passports Tuesday after paying fines of about $ 54 each. An American who took more pictures was fined the equivalent of $ 135, a fellow American said. However, one Swiss who refused to turn over his film Sunday said police beat him and pointed a gun at his head. He said police still have his camera and passport and say they will not return them until he hands over the film and pays a fine. He said he was not injured. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has not said how long martial law will be in effect, although it is certain to last through Friday, the 30th anniversary of a failed uprising in 1959 that led to the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s exile.

<HEAD>Chinese Reportedly Helping Build Iranian Missile Factory</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, with help from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, is building a plant to produce surface-to-surface missiles with a range of more than 500 miles, Western diplomatic sources said today. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> continues to develop materials to conduct chemical warfare. They said the missile factory is in northeastern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but they did not give the precise location. `` It's a missile plant and the Chinese are lending support to build it. That much is known,'' one source said. Surface-to-surface missiles are used against land targets such as military installations and population centers. Although <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> deny any arms deals, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other Western officials say <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been a principal supplier of weapons for <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s regime. The sales, estimated by these experts at more than $ 1 billion, have included two types of jet aircraft and the HY-2 Silkworm and C-801 anti-ship missiles, which have a range of less than 100 miles. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s deputy prime minister, <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiyun </PERSON>, ended a five-day trip to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Tuesday, according to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> television, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. It said the visit concentrated on trade and industrial ties, and made no mention of weapons. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said a year ago it was building its own version of a `` foreign missile'' for use against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. A U.N.-mediated cease-fire on Aug. 20 halted the eight-year war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has not given details on the missile it is building, but Western experts have said it would be relatively simple for the Iranians to have copied Soviet-designed `` Scud-B'' rockets acquired from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s arsenal does not include a surface-to-surface missile with a 500 - to 600-mile range, according to the authoritative reference <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Weapons Systems However, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has produced a series of mobile, land-based missiles including the SS-12 and its successor, the SS-22, each with a range of about 540 miles. The Soviets also are replacing the Scud-B with the SS-23, a 300-mile range missile. During the Iran-Iraq war, the nations periodically bombarded each others' population centers, a practice that became known as the `` war of the cities.'' <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s capital, is only 60 miles from the border and originally gave <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> a strong advantage. But the `` war of the cities'' reached unprecedented intensity last year when <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> began using long-range missiles to batter <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and other areas of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> previously beyond range. Some analysts have said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s use of the missiles, Soviet Scud-Bs with so-called `` strap-on'' boosters to increase their 160-mile range, was a key factor in forcing <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to agree to the cease-fire. The diplomatic sources said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were known to be continuing the development of chemical weapons. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> admitted to the use of poison gas against Iranian forces and Kurdish rebels during the war, and a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> report in April said there was evidence that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also had used gas. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says it has the ability to manufacture chemical weapons but that it has neither produced nor used them in the war.

<HEAD>School Board Bans Apple Sales Over Pesticide Fears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Students may still bring apples for their favorite teachers, but they wo n't be able to buy them in the school cafeteria, officials have decided in reaction to reports of possible health risks. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, which feeds students in 1,200 public and parochial schools, has barred the sale of apples in lunchrooms over fears that they are treated with a cancer-causing pesticide, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> reported today. `` We have conflicting information,'' a high-ranking board official, who asked to remain anonymous, told <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>. `` The apple processors say they do n't use -LRB- the pesticide -RRB- Alar. The media says they do. `` In the meantime, to maintain a high confidence level, we took them off the market,'' the official said. Apple juice and sauce, however, are still being served. Last year, 13 million apples were sold or distributed to public and parochial school students in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> last week reported that the pesticide diaminozide, which is sold under the brand name Alar, could increase the incidence of cancer in children who drink a lot of apple juice. Apple growers have reacted angrily, saying only about 4 percent of all apples sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> show any traces of Alar and those amounts are well below levels permitted by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Alar is used to maintain firmness and resist bruising in fruits and vegetables.

<HEAD>A Look at Chinese-Tibet Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tibetan resentment toward Chinese rule, largely muffled since a failed uprising in 1959, has erupted in violence four times since 1987 in the capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>. Here is a chronology of the incidents: Sept. 27, 1987 _ Police move in to arrest leaders of a small pro-independence march led by 21 <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks. Oct. 1, 1987 _ Chinese National Day. About 2,000 Tibetans, angered by the arrests, storm <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>'s central Barkhor Square, setting fire to a police station, waving the banned <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> flag and stoning police. Chinese officials say six died and 19 were injured. Tibetans and foreign witnesses put the death toll at 14 and say hundreds were injured and arrested. March 5, 1988 _ Two days of violence begin on the final day of a major prayer festival, when a monk stands up during ceremonies at <LOCATION> Jokhang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Temple </LOCATION> and begins shouting for independence. Rioters loot and burn shops and set fire to vehicles. Chinese officials say one policeman died when Tibetans stabbed him and pushed from a window and another 300 were injured. Unconfirmed reports from foreign travelers put the death toll at 24. Dec. 10, 1988 _ About 30 <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and nuns, some carrying the Tibetan flag, march into the central square outside <ORGANIZATION> Jokhang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the U.N. Declaration on Human Rights. Crowds surge toward the marchers and begin throwing stones at police, who open fire and kill at least one monk and a child. March 5, 1989 _ A small pro-independence demonstration by monks on the anniversary of the March 1988 riots touches off widespread violence, with hundreds of mostly young Tibetans rampaging through the streets, burning and destroying Chinese-owned buildings and property and stoning police. March 7, 1989 _ The government declares martial law in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> and puts the death toll from the latest violence at 12, including one policeman. Tibetans say police shot scores of people to death.

 Fire swept through a five-story apartment building in this eastern city today, killing 11 people and injuring eight, fire officials said. An undetermined number of people were missing, said a fire department official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The fire broke out about 3:30 a.m., and 80 firefighters brought it under control about two hours later, he said. He said the fire started in a third-floor stairway but that the cause had not been determined. Four people died of injuries suffered when they jumped out of windows on the upper floors of the old building, located near the local university, the official said. Four bodies were found in the ravaged building soon after the fire was extinguished, and three more were found later by fire investigators. The fire official said five residents of the building and three firefighters were injured.

 Victims of the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> gas disaster ransacked the office of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> today, as the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> began hearing arguments challenging the government's authority to settle their compensation. `` Killer Carbide Quit India!'' screamed about 140 demonstrators who formed a human chain around the multinational company's office in central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, while a dozen stormed into the reception area. They broke windows, smashed furniture and scribbled slogans on the walls of the reception area, according to company spokesman <PERSON> Subramanium </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumaraswamy </PERSON>. `` We Will Not Allow UCC To Get Away With Murder!'' protesters outside yelled. Nobody was injured in the melee, which lasted 20 minutes, <PERSON> Kumaraswamy </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, Conn.-based multinational asked for police protection. The protesters were among about 800 victims who came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> from the central town of <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> to demand the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> scrap its Feb. 14 order that <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> pay $ 470 million as `` full and final'' settlement to victims of the 1984 accident. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s government agreed to the settlement after originally suing for $ 3 billion It was the world's worst industrial accident, killing at least 3,400 people and injuring more than 20,000. Four years later, people still are dying from effects of the gas leak at the pesticide plant. Police and paramilitary troops searched those entering the court, whose main gates were locked against 800 demonstrators squatting in the road. Inside, the court heard the petition of C.L. <PERSON> Sahu </PERSON>, a victim challenging the government's right to pass the Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster Act 1985, which made it the sole representative of all gas victims. <PERSON> Sahu </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> R.K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garg </PERSON>, said the act denied fundamental rights to life and livelihood guaranteed by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s Constitution. It `` challenged the concept of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> as a free nation,'' <PERSON> Garg </PERSON> argued. He said the government erred in failing to hold <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> liable for the disaster. Chief Justice <PERSON> Raghunandan </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pathak </PERSON> last week appointed five judges to hear the case. They were chosen after Judge E.S. <PERSON> Venkataramiah </PERSON>, one of five judges who ordered the Feb. 14 settlement, quit the panel because of widespread criticism of the agreement. Opposition politicians, newspapers, prominent citizens and gas victims say the government settled for too little. Union Carbide deposited the entire amount with the court on Feb. 24. It is being held while judges decide whether to admit petitions challenging the order. About 570,000 people filed claims with the government that they were affected by the lethal leak of methyl isocyanate on Dec. 3, 1984. `` If the court has any respect for the voice of the people, it will change,'' said one of the demonstrators, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> of the Bhopal Gas Victims Women's Industrial Organization. The hearings continue Thursday. Judges must decide whether they will admit the petition for review of the court's judgment, which absolved Union Carbide of all liability, civil and criminal. Union Carbide says the accident was sabotage by a disgruntled employee. The government says it was caused by negligence.

 A pro-Iranian militant group holding two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostages said today it has completed plans to kill British author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> for allegedly defaming Islam in his novel `` The Satanic Verses.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> warned in a statement delivered to a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> that `` the execution'' will be preceeded by attacks on British police. It did not threaten the hostages. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> declares that it has completed its preparations to execute the just sentence issued by esteemed cleric and great struggler <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>,'' the group said. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> issued a death sentence on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> Feb. 14, and Iranian clerics put a $ 5.2 million bounty on the author's head. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> is in hiding. The hand-written Arabic-language statement was accompanied by an instant photograph of hostage <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>. Revolutionary Justice announced Oct. 21, 1986 it had kidnapped <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, a 58-year-old writer from <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt </LOCATION>.

 Operators shut down one of the two reactors at the McGuire nuclear power plant near <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> after a leak caused a small amount of radioactive steam to be released into the air, officials said today. There was no danger to the public or employees, but plant officials declared an alert at 11:45 p.m. Tuesday, said <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the plant. An alert is the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s second-least serious of four emergency categories. It means that an event has occurred that could potentially affect the safety of the plant. `` The average person should not have cause for concern,'' <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said. `` The unit was shut down safely and the unit right next to it is continuing to supply power to our customers on a cold morning. We will continue to keep the public's health and safety at the top of our concerns.'' Utility officials could not provide any measurement of the steam leak, but <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said the radioactive material released was `` within the conservative operating specifications'' of the plant. <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said the leak occurred in one or more of the 4,600 small tubes that each of the plant's eight generators has to receive super-heated water from the reactor core. The heat boils uncontaminated water to create steam, which runs turbines that generate electricity in a secondary unit, separate from the containment building where the reactor is located. `` One or more of these tubes developed a leak,'' he said. `` It's not uncommon for this to occur and to have the potential for the water in the secondary unit to become contaminated `` This is one of those events our operators are trained to deal with on simulators,'' he said. `` This was a textbook example of how to react.'' <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said it was too soon to predict the cost of repairs, which could take weeks. `` This will require cleaning up the secondary side where the contamination occurred,'' he said. `` We also will have to repair the tubes.'' <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Warlick </PERSON>, spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, said an emergency response team was assembled in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> to monitor plant conditions.

 Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> plans to sue Time magazine for printing the comments of a Greek banker who accused <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> of involvement in a banking scandal, the government said today. The announcement made over state-run radio and television did not say when <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> would file suit against the New York-based magazine. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> described as `` despicable'' the interview with banker-publisher <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, the central figure in the scandal. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> said today the magazine tried to interview <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> before publishing the article. `` We remain interested in the prime minister's response to Mr. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>' allegations. We hope that these matters will be fully and promptly aired in a public forum rather than a court of law,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> of Time's legal department. Opposition parties, meanwhile, continued to demand <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s resignation The <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said general elections should be held as soon as possible. It called for mass nationwide rallies next Wednesday to protest the scandals. The governing <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>'s second four-year term in office ends in June. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION>, has been accused of siphoning off $ 200 million of the bank's funds. He fled <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in November and ended up in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he is being held in a <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, jail pending the outcome of a Greek request for extradition. The Time interview quoted the 34-year-old <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> as saying <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and several leading members of his government allegedly authorized a plan to embezzle millions of dollars from the bank. Government spokesman <PERSON> Sotiris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> made it clear that <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and his government had no intention of stepping down. `` His opponents who never have been and never will be able to defeat him in elections, dream of his resignation,'' said <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON>. He repeated charges that the <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> scandal was part of a series of `` orchestrated attacks against <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> by local and foreign centers of destabilization'' which were aimed at subverting what he described as the popular progressive movement in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>.

The arrests came after police accompanied her to a state park west of <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> where she had arranged to sell chemicals to a suspect.

<BYLINE>5,000 Students March Legally in Warsaw; 3,000 Rally in Southern
Poland ^By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 5,000 young people marched peacefully today to mark the anniversary of 1968 police beatings of students and to celebrate a government promise to legalize a banned student group. About 3,000 students at <ORGANIZATION> Jagiellonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the southern city of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> also rallied to support the group, the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Those students, heeding an appeal from the university rector, did not leave campus and risk a confrontation with police. In February, a series of marches in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> resulted in stone-throwing clashes with police. In an unusual move Tuesday, <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> officials granted permission for the march in their city. The decision coincided with an agreement at negotiations between Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and government officials to restore legal status to the student association. Like Solidarity, the student group was banned following the December 1981 martial-law crackdown. The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> march started when about 1,000 people walked two miles from the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where they joined about 4,000 students and professors for a rally. Police halted traffic for the march, led by a woman pushing twins in a baby carriage. The marchers chanted `` No success without <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION>,'' the initials in Polish for the student group. After a wreath-laying ceremony at a campus plaque marking the 1968 events, the participants walked a few blocks off campus to a monument honoring the 19th century Polish epic poet and patriot <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickiewicz </PERSON>. Police and plainclothes <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> worker activists beat students on March 8, 1968, following student protests against the closure of a performance of <PERSON> Mickiewicz </PERSON>'s patriotic play `` Grandfathers.'' `` The March events, looked upon from a perspective of 21 years, make us aware of a certain great truth _ how pitifully ineffective are the efforts of all those who stand against the natural and inborn wish for freedom,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> rector <PERSON> Grzegorz </PERSON> <PERSON> Bialkowski </PERSON> told the students. He told students to think about the history of the country and consider how the 1968 events contributed to current reform efforts in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Many of the students expelled for taking part in the 1968 protest became leaders of the Solidarity trade union movement, which began in 1980. One, <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>, now a leading opposition theoretician and adviser to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, was welcomed to the rally at <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jagiellonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> by rector <PERSON> Aleksander </PERSON> <PERSON> Koj </PERSON>, the chief academic officer `` It's a moving day for me. What happened 21 years ago changed my generation and my life,'' <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> said. He said students in 1968 protested because, `` We did not agree that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> should become a country where people were stripped of their humanity.''

 A reporter for the country's largest newspaper was detained in a courtroom today for allegedly stealing photographs of a prostitute who is the key state witness in a murder trial Police said the call girl, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Preez </PERSON>, had complained that pictures of her were taken from her home without permission. Two photographs of her were published over the weekend by the <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Janine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reporter, was sitting in <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> waiting for the murder trial to resume when a plainclothes officer served her with an arrest warrant based on Ms. <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Preez </PERSON>'s complaint. Ms. <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> was asked to accompany a police officer out of the courthouse. After consultations involving her, the police, an editor and a newspaper lawyer, she was allowed to remain free pending possible further proceedings in the case. No date was set for such proceedings. Ms. <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Preez </PERSON> testified last week against <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Krebs </PERSON>, 35, who is accused of murdering her husband, <PERSON> Ralf </PERSON> <PERSON> Krebs </PERSON>, after telephoning an escort agency and asking Ms. <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Preez </PERSON> to come to their home for a three-way sex session. Mrs. <PERSON> Krebs </PERSON> acknowledges having brandished a gun during a scuffle that ensued but says her husband was killed by a shot that was fired accidentally. The trial has been front-page news in many South African newspapers for the past two weeks. The prosecution completed its arguments today. Photographs of Mrs. <PERSON> Krebs </PERSON>, usually smiling and elegantly dressed, have appeared almost daily in the press, while Ms. <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Preez </PERSON> has shielded her face from photographers.

The assault occurred in a cell where <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> was being held with three other prisoners and is being investigated, <PERSON> Feirrell </PERSON> said. After the beating, <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> was placed in isolation, he said. Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>, who started again using her maiden name after the divorce, had been putting her life back together, say co-workers and acquaintances. She had taken a job at the women's shelter and joined a commission on the status of women, but co-workers said she always feared her ex-husband would return to kill her. `` She said her choice at that time would be to run, change her identity and hope he would n't find her, or stay and fight,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Chilcote </PERSON>. `` She was n't quite sure what was going to happen.'' On Saturday, while neighbors watched, Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> was struck on the head at least 20 times with an unloaded shotgun used as a club, authorities said. She died at the scene before help arrived, said Coroner Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Grwinski </PERSON>. <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> was arrested a short time later in nearby <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>. `` It seemed like it did n't faze him in the least,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Norval </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who arrested <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON>. `` He had, you might say, completed a mission he set out to achieve.'' Because of the slaying, Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> suspended the prison-release program until the end of the month pending a review. Two state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> employees also were suspended for granting the furlough and failing to notify Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mishawaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the Status of Women, to which Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> was appointed late last year, described the victim as a `` very quiet person, low-keyed, soft-spoken.'' She said Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> did not talk about her battered past, `` but typically that is a secret of the victim.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> started as a counselor at the shelter in August and rose quickly into a $ 14,000-a-year job as program director, said Ms. <PERSON> Chilcote </PERSON>. She also recently had completed a bachelor's degree at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, taking psychology and business courses. `` <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> did everything she could to legally get into the system and get her husband locked up and the system failed,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said.

 Moslem guerrillas today seized a government military outpost that protects <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and also attacked the airport at the strategically important eastern Afghan city, rebel sources said. Also today, the president of the guerrilla government-in-exile told the Afghan people in his first radio broadcast from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> that his fighters are `` on the verge of final victory'' over their government's forces. The insurgents fired long-range artillery late Tuesday at the <LOCATION> Samarkhiel </LOCATION> fortress and overran it this morning, a guerrilla spokesman named <PERSON> Satullah </PERSON> said in the Pakistani border city of <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>. Several other Afghan sources confirmed <PERSON> Satullah </PERSON>'s claim, but there was no independent confirmation. No casualty count was given. The guerrillas attacked the airport at the same time as the Samarkhiel offensive, a guerrilla source said on condition of anonymity. Insurgents destroyed a military transport plane parked at the airport Tuesday, and <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> said two people were killed. The radio report monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> gave few details but was confirmed by rebel sources. <PERSON> Satullah </PERSON> said guerrilla positions around <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, particularly to the south of the city, were heavily bombed in retaliation for rebels' Samarkhiel conquest. Another rebel source said `` there was indiscriminate bombing last night and this morning.'' The rebels downed a helicopter gunship and Soviet-made MiG-25 fighter jet today near <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Satullah </PERSON>. The government aircraft were hit by U.S.-made missiles. There were no survivors, he said. Guerrilla sources gave conflicting reports about the fighting at <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> airport, with one source claiming the insurgents had captured it. `` The fighting at the airport is still continuing,'' <PERSON> Satullah </PERSON> said. Stinger missiles, which <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> began supplying to the guerrillas almost two years ago, are credited with inflicting costly losses on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s air force during the nine-year Soviet military intervention that ended last month. In a 16-minute radio address from the guerrillas' headquarters in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, the leader of the government-in-exile, <PERSON> Sibghatullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON>, told Afghans: `` We have no doubt at all that the puppet ... government which is responsible for the killing, the destruction and the displacement of millions of Afghan refugees will never be able to stand against <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> again.'' He said his top priority is the `` complete removal of the government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the return of peace and security to the whole country, and preparations for the suitable conditions for the return of reguees.'' <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON> called on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> organization to recognize his government-in-exile, which says it will hold its first Cabinet meeting Friday at an undisclosed location inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> is about 45 miles west of the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border on the highway that connects <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the Afghan capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> today laid the cornerstone of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s capital. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was the first country to recognize the independent state declared in November by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile `` We know for freedom there is a very high price,'' said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. `` As you have paid for your freedom, we will continue to pay for ours,'' he told Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. More than 100 foreign diplomats and dignitaries, many from <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries, attended the ceremony. The <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> would be the Palestinian state's capital, but it did not specify the state's boundaries. A 21-gun salute and a flyover, by six U.S.-made F-16 jet fighters, greeted the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman upon his arrival in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> earlier made a brief stop in Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Larkana </LOCATION> and laid a floral wreath at the grave of her father, <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. The elder <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was overthrown by army Gen. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia-ul </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> in a 1977 coup and hanged two years later. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> died in August when his aircraft crashed. His death paved the way for the first free elections in more than a decade, which brought Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> to power. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> -RRB- is following in spirit this celebration,'' said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, who was a friend of <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief was expected to meet President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> and Afghan guerrilla leaders before going to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s consul general, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Alhih </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> hoped to play an `` important role'' in solving the Afghan problem. Moslem guerrillas have battled <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s communist government for a decade and have vowed to overthrow it. Last month in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, guerrilla leaders declared a government-in-exile, basing the move on presumptions the Afghan government will fall and the guerrillas will take power. <PERSON> Alhih </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief is not expected to give the Afghan guerrilla government recognition. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is allied with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, while the Afghan guerrillas are supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

 March 6 The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on drug-treatment rules: Acquired immune deficiency syndrome has broken all the rules, and society is slowly reacting to the epidemic. The latest change is a recommendation from two federal health agencies to make methadone, a synthetic narcotic, more readily available to heroin addicts seeking treatment. The goal is to fight the spread of AIDS through needle sharing by intravenous drug abusers. In less than a decade, this fatal disease has claimed 49,976 lives, and has been diagnosed in 39,000 more people. After a halting start the medical community is in hot pursuit of vaccines, but the disease has proven an elusive target. ... Weaning addicts from needles with methadone or reducing the reuse of needles by distributing clean needles takes a change of attitude for ... professionals, lawmakers and citizens. As the human and financial toll of the AIDS epidemic mounts, society will be reassessing many old values. These early public health adjustments may seem quaint.

Finding care for the most important people in their lives, their children, is a financial and emotional burden. It is the burden of government as well, as states seek to define their role in providing day care assistance to those who can not afford it. ... Though it's no longer uncommon for both parents in a home to work full-time, and certainly common for single mothers and fathers to work, employers have taken the attitude that caring for children is the family's problem. It is, but not entirely. Children who are not given adequate care in their first three or four years frequently find themselves behind in school from the start, and they never catch up. That hurts them in the adult work force, and it ultimately hurts their community and their state. In that sense, then, the lack of good day care is everyone's problem

For the first time since the energy crisis of the 1970s, -LRB- in 1988 -RRB- Americans' appetite for oil, coal, natural gas and other types of energy grew faster than their productive output. A continued decline in energy efficiency would have a number of unwanted consequences.

The rate at which finite energy resources are depleted would accelerate. Air pollution, acid rain and the greenhouse effect would be aggravated. ... -LRB- M -RRB- any of the problems caused by wasteful energy consumption, ranging from smog to excessive reliance on foreign suppliers, need to be addressed even if energy remains cheap and plentiful.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> opened an extraordinary meeting with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Roman Catholic leaders today and challenged them to proclaim the church's message in `` a world that does not often readily accept it.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> spoke briefly in English to 36 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prelates summoned to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> for a meeting the Americans hope will ease tensions between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Catholics and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, which has been unhappy about dissent among the American faithful. Many American Catholics, for instance, disregard church teaching on matters such as artificial birth control and remarriage for divorced people. The role of the bishop is expected to be the dominant topic in the 12 hours of discussions with top <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials through Saturday. Other issues on the agenda include the family, the sacraments and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> education. `` I wish to encourage you in your ministry,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> told the bishops, gathered in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s Old Synod Hall. `` I am fully conscious of the challenges you face in bringing the Gospel message to a world that does not often readily accept it.'' `` Your people experience the difficulties of being Christians in today's world. Yet at the same time they search for direction in following the path marked out by <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>.'' Earlier today, a cardinal representing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops declared that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> democratic freedoms are not at odds with faithfulness to the church. American bishops have maintained that disagreement among Catholics reflects their democratic heritage. The pope, however, says people can not dissent from church teachings and be considered `` good Catholics.'' `` As <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops, we value highly the founding principles of our country and its democratic traditions,'' Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said at a news conference before today's meeting began. `` While as a community we operate according to different principles ... I do not see these freedoms or their exercise as being in conflict with our faithfulness to the universal, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> tradition that is ours.'' Cardinal <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gantin </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, said `` there is n't alarm'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> church, but `` it is true that problems exist.'' `` We already studied the burning, difficult, serious problems'' during visits by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops last year, he said at the news conference, and this week's meeting will focus on how to resolve them. He mentioned the secularization of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> society as a problem for the American church. `` I expect that there will be a free-flowing discussion among everyone there,'' Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview Tuesday. He added: `` There will be probably, in any free-flowing discussion, points of difference, points of difference that will be discussed and faced.'' The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> believes the 52-million-member American church is critical because of its size, its wealth and its potential to set worldwide trends. The pope summoned much of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> for this week's session: the five active <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cardinals, 30 archbishops and a bishop, all representing major dioceses. <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON> said Tuesday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hierarchy hoped to increase the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s understanding of American culture and the church's part in it `` When you are involved in a universal church such as ours, there is a need for communication,'' he said. `` The more we can do, the better everyone understands what is involved.'' May said some problems with <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> stemmed from a `` lack of understanding'' by <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials. `` Some of these men have not been in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, or not very much,'' he said in a telephone interview. He said he hoped the meetings lead to a `` deeper understanding of separation of church and state, a deeper understanding of freedom of thought in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... a deeper understanding of the democratic process that we're used to, which is not always the way things are done in the church.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> unveiled `` 5 Days To Launch'' signs at space center gates Wednesday and said space shuttle Discovery would lift off Monday with five astronauts and a $ 100 million communications satellite. Such signs usually show up about three weeks before a launch but were displayed much later this time because suspect or faulty equipment delayed the launch four times past its target date of Feb. 18. The latest setback came Monday with the failure of a system that commands separation of the two booster rockets and external fuel tank from the spaceship in flight. The problem prevented a Saturday launch. The faulty unit was replaced with one from space shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday and was successfully tested overnight, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> reported. `` The Kennedy Space Center is pressing on toward a Monday liftoff,'' she said.

I would never forgive myself if someone was hurt in one of these episodes.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s resignation came 48 hours before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was scheduled to address a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> dinner in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had ` no reaction'' to the <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s stepping down, `` other than what he told you yesterday'' during a news conference. `` He hoped things would be worked out, and they have been'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> had called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, Tuesday night to tell him of his decision and <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> then notified the president. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> students were infuriated when college president <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheek </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> to the board in January. The students cited <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s use during the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign of ads highlighting <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, a black rapist and murderer from the home state of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He masterminded the use of the <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> issue to contribute to the rising anti-black sentiment of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a spokesman for the informal group of students that organized protests beginning last week at the school's convocation Civil rights leader <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, interviewed today on `` CBS This Morning,'' said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> made the right decision. `` The signals that were sent in the <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> ad were not so much about -LRB- prison -RRB- furloughs, but about race inciting fears in white people and creating very painful feelings among African-Americans,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` After eight years of -LRB- former President -RRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, there are fewer -LRB- black -RRB- students in colleges, more of them are in jail. `` Unfortunately, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> symbolizes the worst of that situation.'' Hundreds of students had stormed through the administration building during the annual charter day convocation and prevented entertainer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> from giving the main address. A group of students remained in the building through Tuesday, when they were joined by hundreds more inside and out, chanting, `` <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s got ta go!'' and `` Students Unite _ We're not to be defeated!'' `` It is my assessment that the <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> situation is tearing up the university,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said after meeting privately with the protesters. `` I think, for the sake of peace, Mr. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> ought to find a way to gracefully resign.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commented on the controversy during his news conference at the White House. Asked if the <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> students had a legitimate complaint, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` No. I think it's a good thing he's on the board. ... I think that'll work out just fine.'' District police had stormed the administration building about 12:30 p.m. Tuesday, breaking down the front doors with clubs and dropping officers onto the roof by helicopter. `` We came here to assist the <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> force, which asked for our help,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. But the nearly 100 officers left the scene without making any arrests at the request of Cheek, who said school officials decided to let the students maintain control of the building. `` We are not willing to have the students removed by force,'' <PERSON> Cheek </PERSON> said. `` It's too risky. We have decided to set up the administrative process someplace else.'' Students remained in the building even after <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> announced his resignation from the board, saying they intended to press other demands with the school administration. Those demands included a better financial aid system, improved campus security and amnesty for protest leaders. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> shortly after the election. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> has said one of his goals in the post is to attract more black support to the GOP.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> told <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> `` I do n't care if I have to go to jail I do n't care if I have to lie to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' a fund-raiser for the Contras testified today. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> said he overheard North make the comment to Hunt at the close of a meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> on Sept. 11, 1985. <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> had arranged to make a plane available for North to fly down from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> so that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide could describe the Contras' military needs to <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, a wealthy <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> businessman. North talked to Hunt about $ 5 million to $ 6 million worth of items the Contras needed `` to stay alive,'' recalled <PERSON> Channell </PERSON>, including planes, two types of ammunition, clothing, food and medical supplies. After dinner as they prepared to leave the club, <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> listened as <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> discussed Central American politics. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> asked <PERSON> North </PERSON> whether he was worried about `` getting in trouble,'' <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> recalled. `` <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> said ` No, I do n't care if I have to go to jail for this. I do n't care if I have to lie to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about this,''' Channel testified. Hunt just `` chortled,'' <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> recalled. Hunt contributed $ 237,500 to <PERSON> Channell </PERSON>'s tax-exempt <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> and also made a $ 237,500 loan to the organization. <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> pleaded guilty on April 29, 1987, to depriving the government of tax revenue by using <ORGANIZATION> NEPL </ORGANIZATION> to solicit contributions for military equipment for the Contras. One of the 12 criminal charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> is that he conspired to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> of tax revenue. Six of the charges accuse North of making false statements and obstructing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by attempting to hide his efforts on behalf of the Contras. <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> worked closely with the private fund-raising operation for the Contras. When one contributor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, Taxas, wired money to pay for a Contra shipment that was about to be unloaded, <PERSON> North </PERSON> sent him a mailgram saying, `` Thank you for the help on such short notice.'' North ended a powerful address and slide show to 30 potential contributors on June 27, 1985 at the Old Executive Office Building by displaying a picture of the grave of what he said was a young Contra soldier and saying, `` Ca n't American do better than this. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> should be doing better than this,'' said <PERSON> Channell </PERSON>. Wealthy <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> widow <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Newington </PERSON> and others expressed concern that their contributions might be misused and <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> said he told North that checks were being written to five different organizations. North straightened the matter out by saying that `` you should work through'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, who had set up a <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> corporation to receive contributions, <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> said. `` I liked Dr. -LRB- Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> a lot, but he was running a shoestring organization,'' said <PERSON> Channell </PERSON>. When he traveled to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to talk to <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leaders, it was `` almost like this thing was going on part-time,'' said <PERSON> Channell </PERSON>. In August 1985, <PERSON> North </PERSON> met in his office with <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Garwood </PERSON>, from a wealth <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, family, who gave $ 75,000 to buy a <ORGANIZATION> Maule </ORGANIZATION> aircraft to supply the Contras. At the meeting, <PERSON> North </PERSON> also told her of the well-armed, highly maneuverable Soviet HIND helicopters in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and how the Contras needed hand-held missiles to shoot them down. Meanwhile, prosecutors say the jury should convict <PERSON> North </PERSON> if it finds he engaged in a cover-up, regardless of whether he was acting under orders or was afraid of news leaks. `` When an individual is asked a question by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, there are only two legitimate responses: the individual may decline to answer the question, or answer it honestly,'' the prosecution said Monday in a court filing. `` He can not with impunity knowingly and willfully answer with a falsehood.'' In opening statements, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers suggested that his conduct was authorized by his superiors. The prosecution's motion is an attempt to head off that defense. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, head of the prosecution team, asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to specify _ when giving final instructions to the jury _ that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s alleged motivation for lying is irrelevant to the charges against him. If North genuinely believed disclosure of certain information would damage important interests, `` he could have made an open refusal to disclose or invoked any applicable privilege, asserting his reasons for doing so,'' the prosecution said.

<TEXT>
 The following is the text of a statement issued Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which holds American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Arabic-language statement was translated by The Associated Press in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. In the name of the Almighty. After a thorough reading of The Satanic Verses book and its contents that insult Islam and the Arab prophet, and after examining the study of the so-called <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> declares that it has completed its preparations to execute the just sentence issued by the esteemed cleric and the great struggler <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. Hence, it puts forward the following evidence for carrying out the sentence: 1. Insulting Islam and the Arab prophet is an insult to the latest and greatest human civilization represented by revolutionary Islam. 2. <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s record indicates that he was a branch member of the Freemasons' movement in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Immediately after the publication of his Satanic Verses book, he was promoted to full official membership of the Freemasons' highest council in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> -LRB- or the church of organized atheism -RRB- which combats divine religions, especially christianity and Islam and their great prophets. 3. Imam <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, with his acute awareness of the grave consequences against the future of the divine religions emanating from this Freemasonic and Zionist attack, has handed down his verdict when the Arabs and those who claim to be the protectors of Islam and speak for all the Moslems remained in tight silence. The <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> also declares that before taking any measures, it will find itself compelled to attack British police posts assigned to protect <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> in order to get to him to carry out the sentence. We hold the British government responsible in advance for the human and material losses among the British police and their posts that could result from the attacks on them. This warning applies to all countries that are currently negotiating with the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government to extend asylum and protection to <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. Victory to the oppressed Glory and immortality to the martyrs The <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>.

 An unusually dry winter has helped ease <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s disastrous locust plague, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said Wednesday `` The problem has by no means been eradicated, but it has improved dramatically in the last five months,'' said <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roffey </PERSON>, a locust expert at the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Other helpful factors have been strict measures to combat the pests and their migration to the sea as they moved across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. In January, swarms of locusts devoured crops in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, which already were suffering critical food shortages. Desert locusts aided by easterly October winds traveled 3,100 miles to reach <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands. At the same time, locusts crossed the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>; new invasions were reported in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>; and swarms reached the North African states of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>.

 A partial solar eclipse visible across western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> bored scientists but thrilled crowds that were able to see it despite clouds covering parts of the region. `` It's fabulous to know this is actually taking place. It's very fascinating,'' said <PERSON> Edie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON>, an employee at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, where dozens used solar telescopes to watch the moon eclipse 37 percent of the sun at 9:50 a.m. PST Tuesday. As the moon passed between the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and sun to cause the partial eclipse, it was possible to see mountains on the edge of the moon silhouetted against the sun. Also visible were gas jets on the sun's surface and a giant group of sunspots that on Monday and Tuesday produced major solar flares _ eruptions of heat and radiation _ including the largest since 1984 Clouds over downtown <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> dashed <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> <PERSON> Planetarium </PERSON>'s plans to set up telescopes to watch the moon block 36 percent of the sun at 11:10 a.m. MST `` It's a bummer, but that's the way it goes,'' planetarium spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> said. The eclipse was visible to at least some extent west of a diagonal line stretching roughly from <LOCATION> Mazatlan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, northeast to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Views were best farther west and north. In sunny <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, 600 schoolchildren and at least 400 other people watched the eclipse at <ORGANIZATION> Griffith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> through telescopes and other devices equipped with filters to prevent eye injury. `` There was a childlike delight with the wonder of nature,'' observatory Director <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupp </PERSON> said. Most astronomers were unimpressed, saying they were waiting for a total solar eclipse that will sweep across <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, lower <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> on July 11, 1991. `` You can see a partial eclipse every three or four years,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> astrophysicist <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Libbrecht </PERSON>. `` They're not that exciting. A total eclipse is exciting.'' In <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, dozens of citizens peered through telescopes on the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> mall to see the moon eclipse 23 percent of the sun at 10:55 a.m. MST, but 90 solar scientists stayed inside, attending a five-day conference titled `` The Sun in Time.'' `` That's partly my fault,'' said conference co-organizer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Giampapa </PERSON>, an astronomer at the National Solar Observatory. `` I should have listed it in the program: ` Partial eclipse, presented by God.''' In <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where the moon obscured 80 percent of the sun at 9:13 a.m. <ORGANIZATION> AST </ORGANIZATION>, the eclipse was watched by 26 students from <ORGANIZATION> Bartlett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, several people wearing welders helmets as filters and <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> workers who ended a staff meeting early to see the spectacle. Clouds parted long enough to allow a glimpse of the eclipse for 100 people outside the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> and Industry in often rainy <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. `` Typical Oregon astronomy,'' said amateur astronomer <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>. `` You always have to deal with the clouds.'' Scientists had warned against staring at the sun directly or through inadequate filters, including smoked glass and photographic film or filters. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> MacRobert </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Sky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telescope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> said 245 eye injuries were reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after an eclipse in 1970, but warnings about the danger reduced the number to three during a 1984 partial eclipse.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador said today that an Iraqi ambush killed five Iranian soldiers Feb. 17. It would be the deadliest clash since a cease-fire took effect seven months ago. Iranian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, who have monitored the truce, told him of the incident. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman confirmed that Undersecretary-General <PERSON> Marrack </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>, the chief <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeper, had received reports from his officers that `` five Iranian soldiers had been shot in the back and killed.'' `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said that they had been killed in an Iraqi ambush; however, the investigation by <ORGANIZATION> UNIIMOG </ORGANIZATION> observers could not confirm this,'' the spokeswoman, <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Younes </PERSON>, said. Peacekeeping officials normally do not verify allegations of truce violations by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, leaving that for a secretary-general's report that is issued every six months when the mandate of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers must be renewed. The most recent report was issued Feb. 2. <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON>'s letter said `` Iraqi forces ambushed our patrols'' near <LOCATION> Baneh </LOCATION>, in the central sector of the front, 20 miles from the border with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and about 310 miles west of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The attack killed five Iranian soldiers on patrol, and a communications operator was captured, said <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers `` have inspected the location where the incident occurred, witnessing the martyrs, and have stated that the perpetrators have fled to their bases,'' said <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON>. In his Feb. 2 report, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said two Iranians died in a Dec. 11 clash near the southern border. The nations' forces are separated by only a few dozen yards in many places and in one place face each other across 30 yards of desert, the secretary-general said in the report. The only other reported fatality since the Aug. 20 cease-fire was an Iranian report that one of its soldiers was killed by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> gunfire across the truce line hours after the cease-fire took effect. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> did not confirm the report. Talks aimed at making the cease-fire permanent have been deadlocked since August.

 Two of the city's top police officials chased down a pair of robbery suspects after they saw one running from a gas station with a wad of cash in his hand. `` Being policemen, we knew right away that we probably had an armed robbery,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelma </PERSON>, who along with Chief <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> arrested the men on Tuesday.

In an unmarked police car, <PERSON> Stelma </PERSON>, an 18-year veteran of the department, and <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>, who has been with the sheriff's office for 38 years, chased the supects' car for about three blocks. `` We were right on their bumper,'' said <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>, who admitted it had been a number of years since he had made an arrest. Before the suspects pulled over, they threw the money out of their car. <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> later gathered up most of the money. It turned out that no weapon was used in the crime. One of the men apparently reached into a cash register and grabbed a handful of bills. The two men were charged with theft, police said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today approved legislation to raise the minimum wage to $ 4.65 an hour over three years, and committee Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> predicted the first increase in eight years would be swiftly approved next week by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The committee approved <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s bill, which President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has threatened to veto, by an 11-5 vote with two Republicans joining Democrats for the majority. `` I think we'll get an increase. This is going to be before the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and before the president in the next few weeks,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said afterward `` This will basically restore a minimum standard of decency'' to workers who are now covered by the $ 3.35-an-hour minimum wage that has been in effect since 1981, he said. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said he is `` glad to listen'' to the administration's proposal for a lower `` training wage'' for newly hired workers but said he and committee Democrats remained strongly opposed to it because it has no provision for `` real training'' and all minimum-wage workers would be covered <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> predicted that a presidential veto would be overridden. `` We're going to get this legislation achieved,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> raised the subject of the minimum wage during a morning meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had given <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` our best and last figure up front and his proposal for an increase to $ 4.25 an hour is fair and firm and his last offer.'' Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said last week that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants an increase of 90 cents an hour, to $ 4.25, over three years. She said the raise must be accompanied by a provision allowing businesses to pay all newly hired workers $ 3.35 an hour for the first six months of their employment. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s support for some type of sub-minimum was qualified, with the longtime opponent of the provision saying it would have to be accompanied by training and education for new workers. `` The concept of an educational component to the minimum wage, coupled with real training, is not unappealing,'' said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, the ranking Republican on the committee and a longtime opponent of the minimum wage, earlier said he will support an increase if Democrats accept a training wage. `` If they'll work with the president, there will be a raise in the minimum wage,'' said <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>. An aide to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the senator remains `` nowhere near the administration's position on this'' despite his change. `` We are willing to discuss a training wage,'' said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` For the past eight years what we saw was intransigence -LRB- from the White House -RRB-. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has shown some flexibility and we too are willing to be flexible and to discuss a real training wage,'' said the aide. Other Democrats also said they'll take some form of the `` training wage'' in hopes of reaching agreement with the Republican administration. `` I think some kind of compromise is going to have to be worked out, at some point,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> panel who has also opposed a sub-minimum wage Organized labor has opposed the second tier because of fears that workers would be fired in favor of those covered by the lower standard. But the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> now says it is `` open to discussion on the training wage.'' `` One of the problems in the administration proposal is that every time you take a job you become a trainee again,'' <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lorrie </PERSON> <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON> said. `` And most of the jobs, the lower-paying jobs are not skill jobs, do n't require training at all.''

 It's a designer's job to make good clothes. Creative genius is another thing. There are lots of nice clothes on the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> runway this week where the Italian fall-winter 1989-90 ready to wear collections are showing. But it was n't until the shows of <PERSON> Gianfranco </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fendi </PERSON> by <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagerfeld </PERSON> that the fashion crowd was treated to innovative creations _ the kind experts call works of art and end up in fashion museums. <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> has always stood out in the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> designer crowd, known for its tailored casual clothes, by creating a structured style that looks great on slim, tall models but is more difficult to imagine on the average woman. A broad shouldered sihouette, with cinched waist and narrow hips and either a super short or calf length hemline is his trademark. He loves billowy blouses with big stiff stand-up collars, favors pants over skirts, and likes to nip the waistline in wide belts, and trim cuffs and collars in rich fur. The genius of this winter's collection is the combining of the conventional and the eccentric. Thus a pair of perfectly man-tailored gray flannel pants is spruced up by an intricately pleated black and white blouse, topped by a fox fur scarf, dyed to look like zebra and wrapped around the neck. All of this is wonderful for the fashion pages, but how is one to eat, drink and even talk behind a scarf that covers half the face. <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> also adorns calf-length beige cashmere tunics with these furry feminine neck warmers. More often than not, the scarves come with warm but equally impractical enormous matching muffs. His blouses not only have have generous collars but also wide cuffs with big gold cufflinks. Along with the staple <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> shades of brown, black and gray, <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> uses a lot of red, mixing it with gray flannel by day, and black and gold by night. Adding his voice to the fur debate raised this week between those opting for fake furs and those who wo n't settle for anything but the real thing, <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> not only interspersed fake and real skins, but dyed real fox to look like fake leopard and zebra. The <ORGANIZATION> Fendis </ORGANIZATION> marched on in their search for unusual, innovative ways to work the pelt. For more than 20 years, the <ORGANIZATION> Fendis </ORGANIZATION> have combined their fur expertise with the designing genius of <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagerfeld </PERSON> to create the most imaginative story in the fur market. Several years ago they exhibited their combined technical and creative efforts at <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s modern art gallery For next season, <PERSON> Fendi </PERSON> takes the fur to its bare minimum, stripping it of lavish silk and quilted linings and tanning the leather side to look like polished cotton. Thus, every coat is reversible. Sometimes the pelts from the humble beaver to the lofty mink is worked in patches, with tufts of fur pearing through the leather side. At others it is pierced to create a feather-like lacey effect. This minimal look is further emphasized by the taupe-colored ribbed wool tunics and tights that were the exclusive under-coat outfit. There is lots of combining of fur and fabric in this Fendi collection with fur inlays livening up otherwise simple wool coats. These furs _ starting at more than $ 5,000 with some coats at nearly $ 100,000 _ are not for the woman who has saved for years for her one fur coat. The furs are not showy and not terribly warm, and despite the exquisite workmanship, have a fragile look.

<HEAD>Pentagon Making Scant Progress Against Dangerous Wastes: GAO</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been largely unsuccessful in developing and implementing a program to minimize hazardous wastes at military bases, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The agency, an investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, found that the services have made varying degrees of progress in implementing programs to reduce hazardous waste 50 percent by the end of 1992. `` Clearly the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to reduce the amount of hazardous waste generated, have to date, been unsatisfactory,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., one of two congressmen who requested the report The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study found that the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> report annually on hazardous wastes to the Pentagon but that the report does not require the information be correlated with the workload of major military installations.

<HEAD>Report Calls For ``Supersaver'' Savings Bond Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A private report called Wednesday for a national campaign to reverse an economy-damaging decline in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s savings rate by offering government `` Supersaver'' bonds through monthly payroll deductions. The report, released by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, said a low national savings rate is the biggest economic problem facing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and threatens its ability to remain competitive in the global market. `` Our high consumption rate ... is the single most important cause of both unprecedented trade deficits and inadequate domestic investment during the mid-1980s,'' the report said. `` Restoring national saving at least to the level of the 1970s should be the central goal of national economic policy.'' The authors found that while the government's huge budget deficits _ `` the most popular villain'' _ have contributed to the problem, the decline in national savings primarily has been caused by high consumption of products and services by individuals. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatsopoulos </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> and lead author of the report, said `` Supersaver'' bonds would help people establish regular savings programs since the securities could be purchased only through monthly payroll deductions. People would be less likely to spend earnings from the government-issued bonds since the profits would be available only when the securities were redeemed after seven years, he said. <PERSON> Hatsopoulos </PERSON> said people would be attracted to the bonds by premium interest rates and a national campaign to persuade them that `` it's not only good for you, it's also good for the country.'' Overall, national savings _ the difference between the nation's output in goods and services and what is consumed by government and individuals _ fell from 7.9 percent in the 1970s to 2.1 percent during 1985-87, the study indicated Over the same period, individuals' consumption of goods and services rose from 69.3 percent of national income to 74.1 percent. The report attributed the increase in personal consumption largely to growth in disposable income, a rise in household wealth that exceeded the increase in national wealth, the maturing of the population to ages above 16 when spending is higher, and the spending of equity that was converted to cash in corporate takeovers and buyouts. It found that people can not be counted on to `` rationally formulate lifetime consumption plans based on both their current wealth and their expected earnings,'' and that they tend to spend more if they have extra cash on hand. The report said the propensity to spend whatever is on hand has been highlighted as people receive unexpected lumps of cash from their stock investments when they are paid premiums in the course of corporate buyouts. Rather than reinvesting the cash payments, a big portion gets spent, the authors found. `` Even high-income households with substantial asset holdings may overreact to fluctuations in current income, failing to distribute a current windfall over current and future consumption,'' it found. In addition to recommending a program to increase personal savings, the report also proposed action on two other fronts to increase national savings from a low point that is unprecedented for a period of economic expansion, not only for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but for all industrialized countries: _ Reducing the federal deficit Cutting government spending on goods and services is the most direct approach, although raising taxes and thus lowering private consumption would help to a lesser degree, the report said. _ Eliminating incentives for corporate buyouts The report said the federal tax structure should be revised to eliminate incentives for corporate debt and thus reduce the trend toward higher cash payouts to shareholders. The authors cautioned that while the goal should be to return <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to the savings rate of the 1970s, the shift `` should not be done too rapidly,'' lest the decline in demand topple the country into recession. The study was written by <PERSON> Hatsopoulos </PERSON>, who is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Thermo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> economists <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Poterba </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Krugman </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> is a group of 100 chief executives from fast-growing, mid-sized companies.

Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Walgren </PERSON>, D-Pa., spoke out at a hearing focusing on the Advanced Technology Program at the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> and Standards The program is designed to coordinate development of emerging-technologies and manufacturing-research consortia; foster industry, government and university partnerships, and monitor cooperation between federal and regional agencies. But no money was allotted for the program in the fiscal 1989 or 1990 budgets. <PERSON> Walgren </PERSON> said that when the trade bill, of which the program is a part, became law last year, `` we had high hopes that finally ... we can move ahead and provide the same kind of support to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> companies that is provided to science-based commercial activities in the countries which are our greatest competitors.'' He asserted that `` if we do not modernize our thinking about the role of government and provide the American private sector with the resources they need to compete against the kind of competition which is coming from overseas, we will, I'm afraid, miss out on the vast payoffs which these technologies promise.'' Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, R-Calif., said `` the jury is still out'' regarding what attitude the new administration will take toward the <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> and other civilian high-technology initiatives `` Until we have a national science adviser and the president gets his team in place, we might suspend judgment, at least critical judgment,'' he said.

<HEAD>Afghan Rebels Claim Capture of Army Post Protecting Jalalabad</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Afghan rebels said Wednesday they overran an army post that protects <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, the strategic city near the Khyber Pass, and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> radio accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of air and artillery attacks across the border. The guerrilla government's leader said in a radio broadast from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> the Moslem insurgents were `` on the verge of final victory'' over the Marxist government of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> three weeks after the Soviet military withdrawal. Pakistani officials could not be reached for comment about the charges of military interference, but Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> dismissed similar charges last month. <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Nangarhar </LOCATION> province, is 75 mites east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on the highway to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, about 45 miles from the border. One guerrilla source said the <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> airport also had been captured, but another spokesman, known only as <PERSON> Satultah </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, that fighting continued there. <PERSON> Satullah </PERSON> said guerrillas bombarded the <LOCATION> Samarkhiel </LOCATION> fortress on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>'s outskirts with long-range artiltery late Tuesday and it fell early Wednesday. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> radio said the garrison was attacked, but reported only one soldier killed and did not say it had fallen. Several other Afghan sources confirmed <PERSON> Satullah </PERSON>'s claim, but there was no independent confirmation. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> radio said `` <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> forces are using their helicopter gunships and heavy artillery'' to attack government positions in eastern <LOCATION> Nangarhar </LOCATION> province and in <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, the southeastern province. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said last month the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> military had not participated in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s decade-old civil war and would not do so. About 3.5 million Afghan refugees live just inside <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, in border camps and cities the insurgents use as bases and supply points. Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978 and Soviet soldiers entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. An estimated 115,000 were there at outset of the U.N.-sponsored withdrawal, which was completed Feb. 15. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s official radio also said four <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> army helicopters flew Afghan guerrilla leaders and field commanders Wednesday to <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Abad </PERSON>, about 10 miles east of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. Insurgents destroyed a military transport plane at the <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> airport Tuesday. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> radio, in a report confirmed by guerrilla sources, said two people were killed. <PERSON> Satullah </PERSON> said insurgent positions around the city, particularly to the south, were bombed in retaliation for the capture of the Samarkhiel fortress. Another guerrilla source reported `` indiscriminate bombing last night and this morning.'' Insurgents near <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> shot down an Afghan helicopter gunship and a Soviet-made MiG-25 jet with U.S.-made missiles Wednesday and there were no survivors, <PERSON> Satullah </PERSON> said. Stinger missiles are credited with inflicting costly losses on the Soviet air force since <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> began supplying them to the insurgents two years ago. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have been the main suppliers of arms and financial backing to the guerrillas. <PERSON> Sibghatullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON>, presisent of the new government-in-exile, told Afghans in a 16-minute radio address from insurgent headquarters in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>: `` We have no doubt at all that the puppet ... government which is responsible for the killing, the destruction and the displacement of millions of Afghan refugees will never be able to stand against <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> again.'' He said his priority is `` complete removal of the government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the return of peace and security to the whole country and preparations for the suitable conditions for the return of refugees.'' <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> organization to recognize his government, which he said would hold its first Cabinet meeting Friday inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The site was not disclosed.

<TEXT>
 Former <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> says his grilling before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 set a precedent for the rough treatment that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> is getting in confirmation hearings for secretary of defense. `` Of course I feel sympathy for him,'' <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> said Tuesday before addressing 350 local Republicans. `` I think my episode set a pattern. ... Those folks tasted a little blood.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation of Tower has been jeopardized by allegations of drinking and womanizing and concerns about his ties to defense contractors. <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, nominated for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, testified for 30 hours over five days during his confirmation hearings, defending his conservative record and narrow reading of constitutional protections that enraged civil liberties and women's rights groups After listening to 112 witnesses over 12 sessions, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s nomination 58-42. It was only the 11th time the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had voted against a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee. During a dinner speech, the former federal appellate judge said, `` I think it's legitimate to ask if -LRB- Tower -RRB- has personal habits that will interfere with the performance of his duties.'' But he added that Tower should be confirmed because those habits did not prevent him from being an effective senator or compiling an impressive resume. <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> said there is a new `` venomous mood'' in the capital, and `` <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats in a variety of ways are intent on taking over the functions of the president.'' <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> left the bench in 1988 to `` debate, discuss how we should view the Constitution and how we should select judges.'' He is working on a book that explores the intrusion of politics into constitutional law.

 Prosecutors made two more arrests Wednesday in an insider-trading scandal that has raised questins about <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s big-money politics and stained the vaunted integrity of its civil service Opposition parties boycotted debate on the budget, bringing <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s business to a halt, and renewed their demands that Prime Minister <PERSON> Noburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> call new elections and resign so the public can render its verdict. Those arrested Wednesday were <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, a former vice minister of labor, and <PERSON> Masao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatsumi </PERSON>, a former senior executive of the busiess information conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tatsumi </PERSON> is accused of bribing <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> in 1986 to obtain favorable treatment of Recruit by the ministry <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> was among more than 150 senior bureaucrats, political figures and businessmen who were offered bargain shares in <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a real estate subsidiary of Recruit, before the company was listed. When the shares went on public sale, their value soard and <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> made a profit estimated at about $ 56,000. Prosecutors have arrested 12 people so far, but released two junior Recruit officials Tuesday and have yet to decide whether formal charges will be filed against them. They say <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, the highest-ranking public official held in the scandal, influenced a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> decision on publishing employment information that was to Recruit's advantage. A lower-ranking ministry official, <PERSON> Shigeru </PERSON> <PERSON> Kano </PERSON>, was arrested on bribery charges last month. `` For <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s civil servants, this spelled a most embarrassing scandal that discredited them all in the eyes of the public,'' the influential national newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial. `` We wonder if -LRB- bureaucrats -RRB- are still able to really ` serve' the public at large. If their consciences are being clouded by bribes and so much extravagance, they are betraying the public.'' The Japanese generally have regarded senior civil servants as officials of high integrity. <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>'s arrest came two days after that of <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON>, 78, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest company in terms of stock value Shinto also is being held on bribery charges in connection with alleged favorable treatment of Recruit by the giant telecommunications utility. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s administration has been buffeted by the scandal since the first reports of it last June. Three Cabinet ministers have resigned because of links to Recruit, the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has lost interim elections and a storm surrounds political and corporate ethics. In <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the boycotting <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Komeito </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said they also would insist <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s predecessor as prime minister, <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, appear before a committee. Three <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> aides bought 29,000 Recruit-Cosmos shares in 1986 but he denies involvement in the Recruit affair. `` Without <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> appearing ... we can not participate in the session,'' said Shun Ohide of the Socialists, the main opposition group. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has coupled his refusal to resign with repeated pledges of political reform, but polls indicate a steady decline in his public support. <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest newspaper, released a poll last week in which only 21.3 percent of respondents said they supported the his government, down 6.1 points from January. The January poll was the first since <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> took office in November 1987 to show him with an approval rating below 30 percent.

 The government announced today it is expelling a group of Iranians `` on security grounds'' because of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s death sentence against novelist <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. It also warned Britons living in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to leave, saying they are under increased threat following <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s severing of diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Tuesday. Three Britons are held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The foreign secretary, Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, announced the expulsions in the House of Commons. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> also ordered the closing of the Iranian consulate in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, a British colony, and gave the staff two weeks to leave, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said. Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said up to 30 Iranians will be ordered to leave <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>'s comments came after an Iranian newspaper today said the break in British-Iranian ties will adversely affect the British hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Also today, a group holding two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostages said it has completed plans to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, whose new book, `` The Satanic Verses,'' led to the break. Another Iranian newspaper said <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> must also cut economic ties with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and threaten other Western nations with the same action unless they suppress `` The Satanic Verses,'' which some say blasphemes Islam. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, noting <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has refused to revoke its death sentence against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, said: `` We have therefore decided on security grounds a number of Iranians must be required to leave this country.'' `` We are keeping the activities of other Iranians under very close review,'' he added. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said the expulsion orders would be issued shortly. There are about 25,000 Iranians in Briton. One government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said those expelled `` will be people held to have close links with the -LRB- Iranian -RRB- regime.'' Using his strongest language since the controversy began, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> called the Iranian government a `` deplorable regime.'' Responding to calls by legislators to ban trade with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> replied: `` We stand ready to take whatever action may be necessary in the light of events.'' In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> said it has `` completed its preparations to execute the just sentence issued by esteemed cleric and great struggler <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> to death Feb. 14. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> was born into a Moslem family in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and is a naturalized British citizen. He has been in hiding since the death order. The statement, delivered to a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said `` the execution'' will be preceeded by attacks on British police. The statement was accompanied by an instant photograph of hostage <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, but it did not threaten the hostages. The group also holds writer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, who was acting comptroller of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> when he was abducted. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kayhan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said of the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> controversy: `` The event will leave its negative impact on the fate of the British hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' The British hostages are <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, 49; journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, 32; and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, 38, an English-language teacher at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>. All are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems. The British Embassy in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today advised Britons against traveling to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and advised the estimated 125 already there to leave. The warning was broadcast by Christian-controlled radio stations. There are 15 hostages, including nine Americans, held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the hostage held longest. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985 and has been held longer than any hostage. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s Farsi-language <ORGANIZATION> Abrar </ORGANIZATION> called for an end to economic ties with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> just one day after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced the severing of diplomatic relations. <ORGANIZATION> Kayhan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Abrar </ORGANIZATION> both warned that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s relations with other Western nations may be cut because of those countries' support of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and their withdrawal of envoys from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Their reports were carried by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which is monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1987 imported $ 528 million in goods from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s exports to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> that year totaled $ 321 million <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 11 <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> partners, as well as <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, recalled their diplomats from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> killed. Only the Swedish envoys have returned to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. A trade ban would prevent European nations from winning lucrative contracts to help <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s reconstruction following its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The cost of rebuilding has been estimated at up to $ 500 billion. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Abrar </PERSON> as saying: `` It is now up to the country's political officials to remove the assumption of preserving economic relations from the minds of London-dwellers, and warn other Western countries against the consequences of enmity toward Islam and the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abrar </PERSON> concluded: `` British colonialism must taste its first bitter experience of insulting the beliefs of more than 1 billion Moslems in the world.''

 That fellow in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was practicing an old <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> tradition when he gave President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> an earful on how he was doing in the presidency. In <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s case, the opinion was solicited by the president and was welcome _ the <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> man told him `` things are going just great,'' the president told the press on Tuesday. But the custom of giving the government a piece of one's mind is older than the country, and, more often than not, the petitions from the countryside come bearing barbs. Or splinters. When the construction industry blamed <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> for high interest rates, builders mailed him foot-long two-by-fours to drive home their protest. Read one: `` Please reread your 1976 campaign speeches. It's amazing how much you've forgotten in four short years.'' The National Archives reached into its storehouses of government records to celebrate the practice of citizen telling government, or telling government off. Among the examples on exhibit on the archives' walls are some of those blunt two-by-fours addressed to <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. One lament that might sound familiar to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as he replaces the old <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> guard with new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> faces, was the petition <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodard </PERSON> wrote in 1789 in a failing attempt to remain postmaster of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. `` She hath been discharged without the smallest imputations of any fault, and without any previous notice whatever,'' her petititon said. `` These are but poor rewards indeed for 14 years faithful services, performed in the worst of times.'' When the Bill of Rights gave the people the right `` to petition the government for a redress of grievances,'' the founding fathers were only accepting the status quo. The people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> had been seeking redress long before there was a Constitution. In 1773, the governor of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> protested to a member of Parliament the closing of the port of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in retaliation for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He wrote, `` We are at a loss to conceive how the destruction of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>'s tea could be a just or reasonable ground for punishing so severely thousands of innocent people.'' A century later, <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a slave from northern <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, petitioned <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> with as urgent a question as ever confronts humanity: `` You will please let me know if we are free. ...'' And nearly a century after that, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> put pencil to pad in his cell in <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and wrote a petition to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that moved history. <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> was serving five years for breaking into a poolroom. `` The question is very simple,'' he wrote. `` I requested the court to appoint me an attorney and the court refused.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed and established the right of poor defendants to be represented by lawyers, at the public expense if need be. One of the biggest petitions ever to reach <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> remains as it was received in 1893 _ rolled up on two huge wooden spools. It consists of hundreds of sheets, taped together, bearing an estimated 150,000 signatures, appealing for the establishment of a federal Road Department `` for the purpose of promoting knowledge in the art of constructing and maintaining roads.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> took the hint, creating the Office of Road Inquiry in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. Must have pleased the petition's originator, a bicycle manufacturer, and his customers Few citizens petitioning their government ever did so with more charm than a grade schooler from <LOCATION> Fair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who wrote to President <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> after he pardoned President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> for the crimes of Watergate: `` Dear President <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, `` I think you are half right and half wrong. `` Yours truly, `` <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON>.''

<TEXT>
 Dozens of Jewish women across the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, some joined by their children, launched a three-day hunger strike Wednesday to protest what they say are arbitrary Kremlin policies barring their emigration. Inside a small, dark apartment in a pre-fabricated <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> high-rise, 18 women and four of their children gathered to begin the third annual hunger strike organized by a group called Jewish Women Against Refusal. The date they chose for the beginning of their three-day fast was symbolic: March 8 is International Women's Day in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a national holiday. The hunger strikers, who were packed into a modest living room, said they feared the international popularity of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, known as `` perestroika,'' diverts attention from their plight. `` We are very afraid now because the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> does everything possible to attract attention to perestroika, and many people across the world are deceived,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` It's true that many changes have taken place in this country _ but it's far from being a law-governed state,'' said <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON>, 46, who has been refused an exit visa for 10 years. <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON>'s family was given exit visas in 1979, but the authorites revoked them on the grounds of state secrecy because her husband worked in a classified job as a organic chemistry researcher for two years in the 1960s, she said. At least 48 women and several children are taking part in the hunger strike in nine cities, including <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Irkutsk </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Inna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ioffe </PERSON>, whose apartment was one of two gathering spots in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the hunger strikers. The women in her apartment shared the details of their cases, dried each other's tears and wrote letters to first ladies <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to ask their support. About half of the hunger strikers have been denied exit visas on the grounds of secrecy, <PERSON> Ioffe </PERSON> said. The Soviets have told them they can not leave because they or a relative have been exposed to state secrets, she said. The other half, known as `` poor relatives,'' have been denied permission to leave because their parents or divorced spouses have failed to certify they have no financial claims on the would-be emigrants, she said. One hunger striker was joined in the fast by her twin 13-year-old daughters. The family has not been allowed to emigrate to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> because the girls' father refuses to sign the necessary forms. `` Our former father cast us off when I was 5 years old. We have n't seen him since, and he's absolutely uninterested in us. But when Mom applied to emigrate, he called and said he loves us very much,'' said <PERSON> Vicka </PERSON> <PERSON> Prilutskaya </PERSON>, one of the twins. `` Our father says while he lives he wo n't let us go,'' said the teen-ager, who wore a Star of <PERSON> David </PERSON> around her neck and an Israeli flag pin on her sweater. <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurfink </PERSON>, 56, sobbed as she told her story. `` My only son emigrated to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and I have n't seen him in nine years,'' said <PERSON> Gurfink </PERSON>, as she pulled two photos of her son out of her wallet. `` I ask only to be allowed to go and be a guest of my son, but I am refused,'' said <PERSON> Gurfink </PERSON>, who said she has not been allowed to leave on the grounds of state secrecy. The participants said they hope the hunger strike will encourage the international community to pressure Soviet leaders to write laws forcing officials to deal with cases individually and be more just. <PERSON> Ioffe </PERSON> said she has been told she can not emigrate because her 76-year-old mother-in-law, who also wants to emigrate, was exposed to state secrets in her work as a botanist. More than 20,000 Soviet Jews were allowed permission to emigrate in 1988, which was an eight-year high. The highest exodus, 51,328, was recorded in 1979. It's difficult to estimate how many Soviet Jews have been denied exit visas. The Council for Soviet Jewry, a group sponsored by the Israeli government, estimates the number at 3,600. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Semenovsky </PERSON>, denied an exit visa for three years, says 80,000 Soviet Jews had their applications for exit visas refused last year. And there are new refuseniks. <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrustalova </PERSON>, 41, one of the hunger strikers, said she had just received her notice of refusal Tuesday. `` These three hunger strikes have all been during the years of perestroika,'' said <PERSON> Ioffe </PERSON>. `` Everyone talks a lot about all the changes due to perestroika, but the situation in emigration is still the same.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s approval of Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s tax increase plan sets up an April 29 vote on a constitutional amendment to overhaul a system dating to the populist <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> era. Legislators adopted the proposal Tuesday at a special session <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> called to address a projected budget shortfall of $ 654 million for the next fiscal year. State revenue has fallen sharply because of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s oil-bust recesssion and its unemployment rate of more than 11 percent, the nation's highest. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, the former Klan leader recently elected as a Republican from a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> suburb, promised to lead opposition to <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s program. `` I do n't care what the American <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> thinks about this program,'' the governor responded. On Monday, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> apologized to the House for being photographed shaking hands with an official of the American <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` How can you dare not call this a tax increase?'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> shouted at administration floor leaders during <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> debate. `` How can you say that income taxes will be increased by $ 165 million and that's not a massive tax increase? The <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> administration has depicted the plan as a reform program providing a net increase in revenue of $ 25 million over current levels. Current revenue includes a one-year, $ 500 million sales tax increase, that expires June 30. The <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> proposal would make much of that increase permanent, along with some tax breaks and an increase in income taxes. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s program also includes a 4-cent gasoline tax increase to pay for a $ 1.5 billion improvement program for highways, airports and ports. For both the highway improvement program and the tax code revision to go into effect, a majority of voters must approve a constitutional amendment April 29. Last year, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> had to sell long-term bonds to pay off an accumulated deficit of about $ 900 million. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s initial attempt to revise the tax system failed before the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in October over his proposal to lower the state's $ 75,000 homestead tax exemption The governor did not touch the exemption in his latest package.

The Israeli Embassy reacted swiftly and negatively. `` We regret the decision by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to grant visas to representatives of a terrorist organization and have expressed this position to the administration,'' spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gal </PERSON> said. The conference, scheduled Friday through Sunday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, is sponsored by `` New Outlook,'' an Israeli magazine, and by the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> newspaper `` Al Fajr.'' Several left-wing members of the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, also are to attend. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recommended issuance of the visas to the three Palestinian Arabs, <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sha </PERSON> ` th, <PERSON> Noha </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tadros </PERSON> and <PERSON> Afif </PERSON> <PERSON> Safyah </PERSON>, and that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> He said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was `` involved'' in the recommendation.

<TEXT>
 Public opposition to building new nuclear power plants is due mainly to ignorance of the nation's needs, not concern about reactor accidents, a nuclear industry leader said Wednesday. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Finger </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Awareness </ORGANIZATION>, made the comment, coincidentally, as officials at a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> nulear plant announced they had shut down a reactor after a small amount of radioactive steam was released into the air. Officials at the McGuire nuclear plant, near <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, declared an `` alert'' _ the second-least serious of four emergency categories _ and said the release of radioactivity was caused by a pipe leak. They said there was no danger to the public. Finger, whose group promotes nuclear power, spoke at a news conference to present a paper on the future of the industry. He said that unless atomic plants are built in the 1990s the nation would face electricity shortages. No orders to build nuclear reactors have been placed since 1978, and some utility officials say it's unlikely any more plants will be built in this century. While acknowledging `` there is a general concern about nuclear energy'' among the public, <PERSON> Finger </PERSON> said the main reason people oppose building nuclear plants in their area is doubt about the need for more electrical generating capacity. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public does not know we're headed into this period of very serious electricity need,'' <PERSON> Finger </PERSON> said. Finger said the public's views on nuclear power are not influenced greatly by publicity about accidents and safety violations at atomic reactors, such as the shutdown of the two Peach Bottom reactors in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> in March 1987 after control room workers were caught sleeping on the job. Environmental groups opposed to nuclear power point to incidents such as Peach Bottom, and the less serious pipe leak at <ORGANIZATION> McGuire </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, as reasons to expect the public to continue opposing the building of new nuclear plants. `` These kinds of mishaps, some more serious than others, continue to erode public confidence in commercial nuclear power plants,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Denman </PERSON>, director of the anti-nuclear <ORGANIZATION> Safe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview. Public opinion on nuclear power also has been hurt by recent publicity about lax safety standards and environmental hazards at <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reactors that produce material for nuclear weapons, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. All of the government reactors have been shut down temporarily because of safety, technical and managerial problems.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> encouraged <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops Wednesday to proclaim church teaching even if it is unpopular. They responded that authoritarianism does not convince Americans. The views were voiced at the start of a special four-day conference of 35 American bishops the pontiff summoned to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Dissent from church teaching in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has raised concern in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, which considers the 52 million-member American church critical because of its size, wealth and potential to set worldwide trends. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> described the bishops as `` pillars'' who give the church strength and the bishop's role is expected to dominate the 12 hours of discussions with top <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials through Saturday. He spoke briefly in English to the prelates, who were gathered with <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials in the Old Synod Hall. The meeting was closed but his remarks were made public. `` I wish to encourage you in your ministry,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. `` I am fully conscious of the challenges you face in bringing the Gospel message to a world that does not often readily accept it. `` Your people experience the difficulties of being Christians in today's world. Yet at the same time they search for direction in following the path marked out by <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>.'' Responding to the pope, Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, took up the theme of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> democracy raised earlier in the day by Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Authoritarianism is suspect in any area of learning or culture'' in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, May said. `` Individual freedom is prized supremely. Religious doctrine and moral teaching are widely judged by these criteria. `` Therefore, to assert that there is a church teaching with authority binding and loosing for eternity is truly a sign of contradiction to many Americans who consider the divine right of bishops as outmoded as the divine right of kings,'' he said. `` Accordingly, bishops live and work constantly in this atmosphere.'' Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratzinger </PERSON>, West German head of the powerful Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, addressed the meeting on the `` bishop as teacher of the faith.'' Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was speaking on the issue for the Americans. Both sides emphasized the non-confrontional nature of the meeting, but a conflict arose immediately over releasing speeches by the bishops and officials public. Meetings of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> church hierarchy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are open to the media and the Rev. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, spokesman for the bishops, said: `` My impression is that the American bishops would have no difficulty with having their presentations released to the press, and in fact that is the way they are accustomed to functioning.'' <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials apparently were resisting the idea, however, except for the opening addresses by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and May. Other topics to be covered include the family, sacraments, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> education and the media. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has been troubled by dissent among Americans on such issues as the church ban on contraception and remarriage for divorced people. There also have been calls for women to be have a greater role in church decision-making, but the pope has said repeatedly that women can not become priests. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> says people can not dissent from church teaching and be considered `` good Catholics,'' and during his 1987 visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> he challenged the bishops on the issue. At a news conference Wednesday, <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON> said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> democratic freedoms are not `` in conflict with our faithfulness to the universal, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> tradition that is ours.'' `` Our experiences, like those of every national hierarchy, are rooted in that dual reality: The Gospel which is universal and one as proclaimed in a particular cultural and societal setting,'' <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON> said. He said it is important to `` share these experiences'' with the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and his advisers, just as it is for the Americans to be aware of `` their convictions and insights from the perspective of the universal church.''

 On March 25, <ORGANIZATION> Ants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paju </ORGANIZATION> will mark the 40th anniversary of the day he was placed on a train as a boy and deported to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. The next day, the bearded 44-year-old journalist will stand against a top official for the right to represent central <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> in a new parliament in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In the small Baltic republics, the cracks between Russians and ethnic Balts and between the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the reform-minded <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> are widening as the election draws near. <LOCATION> Paju </LOCATION>, editor of the nature magazine <ORGANIZATION> Eesti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loodus </ORGANIZATION>, is running against the head of the Estonian state agricultural-industrial complex, <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonspoeg </PERSON>, on a platform that mixes environmental and economic issues with the spiritual renewal activists say is crucial to the survival of tiny <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. `` The worse the internal state of people, the greater the possibilities of doing terrible things to our environment,'' <LOCATION> Paju </LOCATION> said in an interview. <LOCATION> Paju </LOCATION> is the son of an Estonian peasant who also was deported to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and died there after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> took control of the Baltic republic in 1940. He was put on a train with a woman he did not know _ his mother was required to remain in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> _ and sent to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> until after <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> died in 1953. Now he hopes to become a member of the 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, which President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> says must help turn the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into a nation governed by laws rather than personal dictate. <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> has gone further than <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> in asserting its independence from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, declaring its sovereignty Nov. 16. Although <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> rejected that claim, the two sides have managed to avoid an open conflict. However, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> has not backed down. Estonian activists say that in contrast to the other Baltic republics, their <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government leadership strongly support the grassroots <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> political movement striving for autonomy from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Candidates such as <LOCATION> Paju </LOCATION> and scientist <PERSON> Endel </PERSON> <PERSON> Littmaa </PERSON>, 58, have appeared to push the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s program. `` Without criticizing everything left and right, it's unlikely you'll be elected,'' said <PERSON> Littmaa </PERSON>. Rifts have appeared between ethnic Estonians, who make up about 60 percent of the population, and <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION>, who comprise the rest. Russians fear that decisions making Estonian the official language, restoring the national flag of the Estonian republic, and moves for economic self-sufficiency will make them second-class citizens. Just as ethnic Estonians rallied around the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, Russians have joined a new organization called Interfront. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estonia </ORGANIZATION> said that of the 742 delegates seated for its organizing convention last weekend, 572 were Russians. Only 11 were ethnic Estonian. An Estonian journalist, <PERSON> Tarmu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tammerk </PERSON>, said the March 26 balloting is more likely to break down on ethnic lines than party versus <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Reports in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Interfront </PERSON> was organizing a general strike for March 14. The republic's reform-minded <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Vaino </PERSON> <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON> went on radio and television Tuesday to appeal for calm and reject extremism. But Estonian activists pledge to fight on. A plan designed to make state-run enterprises answer to <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> rather than <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> ministries is likely to come before the legislature this month. The plan is called IME, an acronym that stands for Economic Self-Government in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, but also means `` miracle'' in Estonian. In the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, Latvians and Russians also are split, but the party apparatus led by <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vagris </PERSON> is wedged uneasily between the two. <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> has the highest concentration of Russians of any of the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> republics, about 50 percent, and a twin of the Estonian Interfront, the Inter-Nationalist Front, is active. <PERSON> Vagris </PERSON> criticized it and the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> People </LOCATION>'s Front in January. `` Both movements have some extremist-minded elements,'' he said. `` Both also involve members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which means that there is also stratification within the party.'' <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> activists accuse <PERSON> Vagris </PERSON> of tilting away from reforms by permitting criticism in the local press of the Movement for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latvia </ORGANIZATION>, a group that cooperates with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> but seeks outright independence. The party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also called for punishment of <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> journalists for muckracking pieces it said whip up ill-feelings between Latvians and Russians. The Russian-language daily <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latvia </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that 90 percent of the 96 candidates for 40 seats in the March 26 election were party members. But that may be of little comfort to <LOCATION> Vagris </LOCATION>. The paper also said 75 percent of the candidates are ethnic Latvians, and <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> officials say roughly 75 percent support its aims. <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, has come in for the sharpest criticism from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which accused it last month of crossing over from support for the party to clear opposition in some cases. In a document dated Feb. 24, the grassroots organization said the election campaign was making some party and economic officials fearful for their posts and privileges. But it also moved to bolster the <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> party leadership, which it views as reform-minded. <PERSON> Alvydas </PERSON> <PERSON> Medalinskas </PERSON>, a top <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the organization had withdrawn candidates running against <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Algirdas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON> and his deputy, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Beriozov </PERSON>, leaving them unopposed. He said <PERSON> Sajudis </PERSON> wanted to strengthen them against a `` Stalinist'' wing of the Lithuanian party.

<HEAD>Dropping Service from Budget Would Cut Deficit $2 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Top managers of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service have an idea for lopping at least $ 2 billion off the federal deficit next year _ remove the agency from the budget. `` If we stay ` on budget,' it will increase the general deficit by over $ 2 billion. Taking us off will avoid that,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Setrakian </PERSON>, chairman of the agency's governing board, said Wednesday. `` The Postal Service does not belong in the unitary budget,'' agreed Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> at a jount meeting of two subcommittees of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Much of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> appears to agree, with committee members reporting that they have more than 200 member signatures on a bill to move the agency back out of the federal budget. `` I want to underscore the ... need for ` off-budget''' status, said Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N </LOCATION>. The subcommittee chairmen, Reps. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, D-Ind., concurred In pressing for removal from the general federal budget, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> leaders appealed to the same logic that led to the agency's being included in the overall budget during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Once a heavily subsidized <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> department, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was made an independent federal agency in 1971. The service's subsidy was phased out and the agency was directed to operate like a business _ breaking even over the long haul and having its own budget Over the years, the agency developed a pattern of operating at a loss some years but making a profit in others _ depending on how recently rates had gone up. But it did break even on average. This was noticed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> and in 1985 the post office _ which had a $ 117 million surplus the year before _ was brought back into the federal budget in an effort to make the national deficit appear smaller. The result, however, was that when the government found itself battling a massive deficit last year cuts were imposed on agencies including the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, forcing delays in construction and closing down post offices across the country for a few days. Collecting and sorting mail on Sundays has not yet been resumed because of the budget crunch. The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is expected to complete the current fiscal year about $ 600 million in the black, then fall into the red in fiscal 1990 _ adding $ 2 billion or more to the federal deficit if the agency is n't removed from the overall federal budget before then. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has said he anticipates having to raise postage rates in 1991 to cover that loss, although he commented at the hearing that he would like to stretch out the currrent system of seeking increases every three years. The last rate hike was in 1988.

 <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> was portrayed Wednesday as a victim of the political symbolism of <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, the black convict <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> turned into a major issue against <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the 1988 presidential campaign. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> resigned Tuesday night from the board of predominantly black <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> after students occupied the administration building to protest his appointment. `` He masterminded the use of the <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> issue to contribute to the rising anti-black sentiment of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a spokesman for the student group. The vehemence of the student reaction against <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> raised questions of how successful the new <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman would be in achieving his goal of attracting black voters to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. However, there also was a view that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a very positive image among blacks, far more positive than that of his party or its chairman. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as a whole has a pretty big image problem among blacks,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, an analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, an independent group that focuses on the black community. `` It is viewed as either not interested in the problems of blcks or actually opposed to the advancement of blacks,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has had a pretty long history with some black leadership,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` People are willing to see <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a moderate.'' The president was flying to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Thursday to be keynote speaker at a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> banquet. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had `` no reaction'' to <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s decision to remove himself from <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s board of trustees, when he defended <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s presence on the board `` He hoped things would be worked out and they have been,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Since becoming chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> early this year, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> native who was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager, has met with scores of black leaders as he has traveled around the country He attended a commemorative service in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on the anniversary of the birth of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. An accomplished rhythm and blues guitarist, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> also has received widespread publicity performing with such black musicians as B B. King. Not all blacks endorsed the action of the <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> students. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON>, who was the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> in 1988, called the Howard protest `` an unjustified reaction on the part of the students.'' <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> also disputed the contention that the <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> ads were racist. `` When I look at <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, I see a criminal, I do n't see a black person,'' he said. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> was a convicted murderer who failed to return from a weekend furlough from prison in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and later raped a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> woman. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign used ads featuring the <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> case to attack Democrat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as soft on crime. Many Democrats, including <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, protested during the campaign that the <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> ads were racist. `` The signals that were sent in the <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> ad were not so much about -LRB- prison -RRB- furloughs, but about race inciting fears in white people and creating very painful feelings among African-Americans,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` Unfortunately, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> symbolizes the worst of that situation,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> who called Atwater Tuesday night and urged him to resign from the board. In his letter of resignation, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman said he wanted to help the school, but `` continuing the controversy surrounding my appointment any longer defeats that goal.'' `` Today's events at <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> demonstrate the possibility that someone could be injured in the protest,'' he said. `` That I could not accept. I would never forgive myself if someone was hurt in one of these episodes.'' `` He feels this is an unjust situation,'' said <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Stent </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> legislative office of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The college fund has a very close and good relationship with the president and his family.'' Emphasizing that she was speaking as an individual and not for the fund, Ms. <PERSON> Stent </PERSON> said she could understand the students' viewpoint `` because of the <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> situation ... I do n't agree with what Mr. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> did personally, but politics is politics and he did what he had to do to win. But, she added, `` Maybe students are bringing us back to reality, that things have to be a little more honest.''

<HEAD>Soviet AIDS Cases Rising Fast; Health Minister Says Danger Ignored</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviets are expressing alarm over the spread of AIDS at home, with the health minister calling it a threat akin to that posed by nuclear weapons. The number of cases in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is expected to rise almost tenfold next year. As recently as 1987, Soviet officials dismissed AIDS as a largely Western problem due to decadent sexual mores and drug use. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> called the disease `` a scourge of God for the downfallen morals in our world.'' But now, the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> says, `` The alarming situation with AIDS demands rapid and decisive measures.'' `` A long time ago, some noted epidemiologists reported with certainty that this new 20th century plague would pass us by,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. But the rapidly increasing number of Soviet cases shows `` AIDS is not somewhere ` over there, in their country,' it is among our population,'' the paper said. `` The threat that we face is no less than the ecological ` bomb' or nuclear weapons,'' Health Minister <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> as telling a conference of Soviet epidemiologists convened to discuss the disease In 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said, 81 people in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were carriers of the AIDS virus. By Feb. 1, it said, 44 more cases were known, and now the number of people infected exceeds 140. `` It's expected that next year, there will be 1,342 sick people,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said, apparently referring to carriers of the virus, rather than people actually suffering the symptoms of AIDS. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said that of four Soviets actually ill from AIDS, three have died. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reported its first AIDS death in October, a 29-year-old <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> prostitute. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON> as telling the meeting that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> ignored warnings that AIDS could become a national calamity. <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> workers tried many times `` to inform the government that the situation was menacing,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. `` But noted scientists dealing with the problem eliminated the acuteness of the question, saying it was all a false alarm.'' In articles that horrified many Soviets, newspapers reported in January that children at a maternity home in <LOCATION> Elitsa </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, had been infected with AIDS because of the multiple use of an unsterile syringe. Nurses at the hospital had been reusing disposable syringes to cover up the sale of unused needles to drug addicts, the reports said. So far, 31 infected children in <LOCATION> Elitsa </LOCATION> have been identified, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said, and `` on average, one more is detected every week.'' Just as Soviets are not any more immune to AIDS than Westerners, some are also liable to treat its victims as pariahs, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It seems recently we read about ` AIDS phobia' -LRB- the fear of getting AIDS -RRB- in the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>,'' the paper said. `` We read, and we shuddered: apparently normal, decent people were compelling a sick person to leave town. They were burning down the house where he lived ... We told ourselves then: Well, no, that's impossible here. But things proved that it is possible.'' In the area around <LOCATION> Elitsa </LOCATION>, people throw rocks at cars with license plates from the region `` as if the cars were spreading AIDS,'' Soviet poet <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kugultinov </PERSON> wrote in <LOCATION> Izvestia </LOCATION> last month. Youngsters from the region are also being discriminated against, he said. `` The relationship of students leaving <LOCATION> Kalmykia </LOCATION> to study in neighboring republics has sharply changed, voices are calling out, demanding to separate them from the dormitories,'' <PERSON> Kugultinov </PERSON> wrote. He said his country should follow the example of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in seeking to prohibit discrimination against AIDS victims. In the past 1 -LCB- years, the Soviets have decreed measures designed to counter the spread of AIDS. In 1987, it became a crime to infect someone else. Regulations announced this year require foreigners who want to stay in the country for more than three months to prove they are free from AIDS. By Western standards, the Soviets, as of now, have only a small problem with AIDS, if the figures published by <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> are accurate. In comparison, the number of AIDS victims in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had risen to 86,157 as of Feb. 16, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Victims of the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> gas disaster rampaged through <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> offices Wednesday, and a human chain surrounded the building screaming: `` Killer Carbide, quit <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>!'' Hundreds of other protesting victims squatted outside the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which Wednesday began hearing a petition challenging the government's right to settle on compensation for all victims of the world's worst industrial accident. About 570,000 people say they are entitled to compensation for the Dec. 3, 1984 gas leak at a Union Carbide pesticide plant in the central town of <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> that killed at least 3,400 people and injured 20,000. Today, people still are dying from effects of the leak. About a dozen people broke away from the protest outside the downtown <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> offices of the <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, Conn.-based multinational Wednesday, and stormed into the reception area. They broke windows, smashed furniture and scrawled slogans on the walls, said company spokesman <PERSON> Subramanium </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumaraswamy </PERSON>. About 140 demonstrators who formed a human chain around the building yelled, `` We Will Not Allow UCC To Get Away With Murder!'' The 10 employees in the reception area were unharmed during the 20-minute melee, <PERSON> Kumaraswamy </PERSON> said. Immediately, the company sought police protection. `` We have posted policemen all over,'' a police official said on condition of anonymity. `` What happened will not happen now.'' Protesters want the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to scrap a $ 470 million settlement agreed to by the government Feb. 14 as `` full and final'' compensation for all sufferers from the disaster. `` I am a gas victim,'' said a yellow paper badge on the sari of a woman among 800 demonstrators who sat cross-legged in the parking lot of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The main gates of the court were locked and police and paramilitary troops searched everyone entering the building. Inside, the court heard the petition of <PERSON> Charanlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahu </PERSON>, 51, a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> lawyer who was in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> at the time of the gas leak. <PERSON> Sahu </PERSON> says his lungs and eyes still are affected by the exposure. His lawyer, <PERSON> R.K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garg </PERSON>, argued the government's assumption of power to act for all victims is a denial of the fundamental rights to life and livelihood guaranteed by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s constitution. <PERSON> Garg </PERSON> argued passionately that the settlement `` challenged the concept of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> as a free nation.'' He said the government had erred in not holding Union Carbide liable. Hearings continue Thursday before five judges, who must decide whether they will admit the petition for review of the court's judgment, which absolved Union Carbide of all civil and criminal liability Chief Justice <PERSON> Raghunandan </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pathak </PERSON> appointed the judges last week after one of five judges who ordered the Feb. 14 settlement quit the panel because of widespread criticism of the agreement. Opposition politicians, newspapers, and prominent citizens have accused the government of selling out to <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>. The government originally sued for $ 3 billion, then settled for $ 470 million. Union Carbide deposited the entire amount with the court Feb. 24. It is being held until the court rules on the petition.

 <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who helped solve the 1950 $ 2.2 million Brinks armored car robbery and was picked for his law enforcement background to manage the first modern American lottery, has died at age 75. Powers died Tuesday in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, where he moved in 1978 after retiring as director of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> lottery. He had undergone bypass surgery in 1979 and last year. The `` Handbook of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Lottery Fundamentals,'' a 400-page reference manual, recognizes Powers as the `` father of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. lotteries.'' He served as president of several national and international lottery organizations. In his retirement, <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> was a consultant to several state lotteries and companies that produce lottery paraphernalia. Powers, as <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent in charge of the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> office, spent six years trying to solve the Brinks case. The break came when one of the hold-up men informed on the others because he felt he did n't get his fair share of the loot. In 1963, after 22 years with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, he was hired to manage the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> lottery because its sponsors wanted to prove it could be run without organized crime influence. `` I remember opponents of the sweepstakes saying that the program would create untold law enforcement problems and underworld counterfeiting of tickets,'' he said in an interview shortly after he retired. `` We proved them wrong. We proved a state can operate a lottery with adequate controls and safeguards to protect the public's interest. As <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> lottery director, Powers, who lived in <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, was instrumental in lobbying <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to repeal an excise tax on lottery winnings and to allow radio and TV stations to broadcast lottery numbers across state lines.

 A man escaped from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in a homemade balloon Wednesday but fell to his death on the western side of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, police said. An East German passport bearing the photograph of the dead man was found near the site where the balloon crashed, said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Dieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Piete </PERSON>. He said other documents found in the wreckage indicate a woman also may have been aboard the balloon.

Police found the balloon after it became snared in a tree. <PERSON> Piete </PERSON> said the balloon, made of heavy plastic, had a harness attached to it containing a man's leather jacket. A plastic bag containing a small radio, books and clothing was tied to the harness, he said. After searching nearly eight hours, police found the body of a man several hundred yards from the crash site and the passport of 32-year-old <PERSON> Winfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Freudenberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` The picture in the passport matches up with the dead man,'' <PERSON> Piete </PERSON> said. On Sept. 16, 1979, eight people in a homemade hot air balloon floated over East German border fences to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, landing safely near the village of <LOCATION> Naila </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>. The story of that escape was later made into a movie. According to official West German figures, 78 people have died trying to escape to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Communist authorities built the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall in August 1961.

<HEAD>Report Says Violence Against Women Worldwide Is Rampant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 On an average day, thousands of women worldwide are beaten in their homes by their partners. Thousands more are raped, assaulted and sexually harassed. These startling estimates are set forth in a new report by <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based research group, that maintains violence against women is a pervasive yet largely ignored problem that affects all societies and socioeconomic groups, particularly in the Indian subcontinent and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` If a person is murdered because of his or her politics, the world justifiably responds with outrage. But if a person is beaten or allowed to die because she is female, the world dismisses it as ` cultural tradition,''' writes <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Heise </PERSON>, a senior researcher at the institute. Over the last generation, women in many countries have made long strides towards achieving equality. These advances were highlighted at many gatherings Wednesday on the occasion of the 79th annual International Women's Day, a congressionally sanctioned observance held each March 8. But, as <PERSON> Heise </PERSON> describes it, the observances were small comfort for countless women for whom the mere fact of womanhood can pose extraordinary risks. For them, `` Home, Sweet Home'' is a cruel illusion. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, says Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, as many as 15 million women have been beaten, raped or suffered other forms of physical and sexual assault, with the number rising by 1 million a year. As <PERSON> Hedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuriel </PERSON>, first vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Domestic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violence </ORGANIZATION>, put it: `` For many of us, it's safer to be out on the streets than to be in our own homes.'' <PERSON> Heise </PERSON>, writing in World Watch magazine, says that, internationally, women tend to be targets because of their sex and that the violence occurs `` without social remorse or protest.'' `` Societies tacitly condone this violence through their silence or, worse yet, legitimize it through laws, customs and court opinions that blatantly discriminate against women,'' she says. During a parliamentary debate in <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> on whether wife-beating should be made illegal, one participant, <PERSON> Williami </PERSON> <PERSON> Wi </PERSON>, was quoted as saying that the practice `` is an accepted custom ... we are wasting our time debating the issue.'' In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Heise </PERSON> writes, countless women have died as a byproduct of the system in which a bride's parents provide gifts to the groom as part of a marriage settlement. Murder, suicide or severe abuse is sometimes the price young brides pay if promised money or goods do not materialize, she says. For a woman in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Ishrat </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dhaka </ORGANIZATION>, the choice is often between a violent home and none at all. In that country, `` separated, deserted or divorced women are socially unacceptable,'' she observes, `` and remarriage is almost impossible.'' To remedy the problem of violence, <PERSON> Heise </PERSON> says, the most important step women can take is to recognize oppression and act together against it. `` Those battered or raped need to know they are not alone and society needs to know the extent of women's victimization,'' she says. `` Violence persists in part because it is hidden. If governments and women's groups can expose its magnitude through surveys and better statistics, then ignorance will no longer be an excuse for inaction.''

<DATELINE>BEIT ARYE, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> vowed Wednesday to block illegal Jewish settlements in the occupied lands after troops foiled attempts by right-wing activists to settle two sites. In clashes with troops in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, 20 Palestinians were shot, including a 13-year-old boy and a 75-year-old man, Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmed two of the injury reports and said it was checking the others. The army blocked two groups of would-be settlers who set out for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> Tuesday night after a rally in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> attended by about 10,000 people. Eight activists from the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Betar </ORGANIZATION> youth movement pitched a tent on a hilltop about 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> where the settlement of <LOCATION> Ofarim </LOCATION> is to be built, said a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The activists pulled up stakes after soldiers told them to leave, the official said. On Wednesday, soldiers guarding the site told reporters it was a closed military area. Other would-be settlers drove three mobile homes from the rally to the <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horon </LOCATION> settlement north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and said they planned to move to the proposed new settlement of <PERSON> Talmon </PERSON> later in the week. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said the group canceled its plans after failing to receive government permits. But photographers said troops stopped the group as it tried to drive to <PERSON> Talmon </PERSON> Tuesday night. The government, a coalition of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, authorized the construction of eight new settlements, including <PERSON> Talmon </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Ofarim </LOCATION>, but has not granted final approval. Labor, which favors some territorial concessions to resolve the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict, has tried to slow construction of settlements. In the past, the government has approved settlements erected illegally. But <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, Labor's No. 2 leader, said: `` We will not allow any settlements -LRB- other than -RRB- in accordance with the government decision and a long procedure, which is set by the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and other ministries related to the problem.'' About 70,000 Jewish settlers live alongside 1.7 million Palestinians in more than 130 settlements in the occupied lands. The settlers want <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to maintain its control over the territories. Some claim the land was given by God to the people of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in biblical times. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the settlements are obstacles to peace and opposes them. Palestinians staged a general strike Wednesday to mark the end of the 15th month of their uprising against the Israeli occupation. The rebellion has claimed 391 Palestinian and 17 Israeli lives. Streets were deserted and stores shuttered in compliance with the strike call by the <ORGANIZATION> Unified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uprising </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group consisting mainly of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zeit </LOCATION>, outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags fluttered from electricity poles, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> activists piled up stones in the main road to block Palestinians from going to work. Palestinian women staged pro-PLO demonstrations in several towns and villages to mark International Women's Day. About 600 women, including Israelis and Palestinians, marched peacefully along a major shopping street in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, chanting `` Israel-Palestine'' and `` <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, how many children have you killed today.'' In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police dispersed about 60 <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students who marched to the <LOCATION> Isawiya </LOCATION> neighborhood to show support for the residents, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Isawiya </PERSON> has been put under curfew while police search for anti-Israeli activists. More than 30 Arabs had been arrested, the radio said.

<HEAD>Julia Child's Cake Pan Rhythms Yield Musical Treat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When composer <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON> watched a videotape of television chef <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Child </PERSON> whipping up `` a very special, ve-e-ery choc ` late-ly, bittersweet, loooovely cake,'' he knew he had the recipe for a scrumptious musical His 20-minute ode to Miss Child's chocolate cake, with lyrics taken verbatim from the tape of a TV cooking lesson in 1961, had its world premiere Wednesday at the Kennedy Center. The musical monologue, entitled `` Bon Appetit!'' after Miss Child's familiar closing line, featured actress <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> singing her way around an imaginary kitchen, flouring cake pans and beating egg whites in pantomime to <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON>'s piano accompaniment. `` Bon Appetit!'' was served up as the dessert course for an evening of <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON>'s meat-and-potatoes classical fare. Then, at a post-concert reception, the audience was invited to sample the real thing _ <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gateau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> au </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chocolat </ORGANIZATION>, l'Eminence <PERSON> Brune </PERSON> _ prepared from Miss Child's recipe by the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s head chef. <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON> and Miss <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> will repeat their musical cake bake, which is scored for small orchestra, during a festival of the composer's music at <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, later this month and at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, on April 9. <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON> confessed that his work on `` Bon Appetit!'' was a severe test of his commitment to a macrobiotic diet, which features such ultra-healthy foods as cabbage, brown rice and fish with seaweed. `` I am tempted not only by the lyrics but by the cake itself,'' he said in a prerehearsal interview. `` I often give in to temptation and say I'll make up for it later,'' he said. `` I love chocolate cake. The things that are out of reach are what we love in this world.'' The 63-year-old composer, who lives and works on a 40-acre farm in the Catskills of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, wrote the piece as a curtain-raiser for performances of a longer, operatic version of the late <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Draper </PERSON>'s monologue, `` The Italian Lesson,'' which he composed for Miss <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> in 1984. <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON> and associate <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulgasser </PERSON> liked the idea of using the script of a Julia Child cooking lesson, and had Miss <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> write the TV chef for permission. She happily agreed, sent along a batch of tapes and suggested her recipe for chicken <PERSON> Marengo </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON> thought chocolate cake was a tastier choice. `` She gets pretty carried away about everything, but especially this dessert,'' <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON> said. During four full days of watching Miss Child's tapes, <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON> was intrigued by the `` rhapsodic phrases'' and musical metaphors in Miss Child's speech as she banged pots, whisked egg yolks into a yellow ribbon and poured out her creamy chocolate batter with a spatula. `` Her speaking patterns really grab you, the phraseology, the unexpected little interjections,'' <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON> said. `` There is a kind of musical cadence in her speech which one is n't aware of unless one starts to set it to music, and then there it is.'' Miss <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON>, a veteran of Broadway musicals who is better known as <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Edith </PERSON>, on the `` All in the Family'' TV series, agrees. `` What I love is her wonderful sense of theater,'' the actress said of the chef. `` She's not just a cook. She's a character, very rich and very humorous.'' Miss <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> makes the most of Miss Child's comic touches, tapping an invisible cake pan and instructing her audience to `` knock out the flour on the floor, if you have a self-cleaning kitchen like mine.'' The music accelerates when she beats egg whites in an unlined copper bowl in a frantic race with an electric mixer. `` We're going to see who wins,'' she sings, `` and I think maybe I'll win ... because I'm bigger.'' Next time _ if there is one _ Miss <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> says she'd like to collaborate with <PERSON> Hoiby </PERSON> on the chicken recipe. `` Chickens are always funny,'' she said with a laugh.

<TEXT>
 An Iraqi ambush killed five Iranian soldiers last month despite a cease-fire in the eight-year war between the nations, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador said Wednesday. Also on Wednesday, a senior Iraqi foreign ministry official, <PERSON> Riyad </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Kassy </PERSON>, arrived at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters for discussions with officials on coming peace talks between the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Iranian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said he learned of the troop deaths from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which has monitored the cease-fire since it went into effect Aug. 20. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary-General <PERSON> Marrack </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>, the chief peacekeeper, received reports from his officers that `` five Iranian soldiers had been shot in the back and killed'' Feb. 17, said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Younes </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said that they had been killed in an Iraqi ambush; however, the investigation by -LRB- peacekeeping -RRB- observers could not confirm this,'' she said. <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> discussed the deaths in a letter to Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> that said `` Iraqi forces ambushed our patrols'' near <LOCATION> Baneh </LOCATION>, about 20 miles from the border and about 310 miles west of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. A communications operator was captured, <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said. Perez de Cuellar reported Feb. 2 that the worst violence on the 740-mile front line occurred Dec. 11 in the southern border region near the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway dividing <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Two Iranians were killed in that clash, which involved artillery, rocket and small-arms fire. The armies are separated by only a few dozen yards in many places, and in one spot face each other across 30 yards of desert, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said last month. The only previous report of a fatality on the front came just hours after the cease-fire took effect. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s report did not confirm <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s claim that Iraqi gunfire killed a soldier in that case. Peace talks between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been deadlocked since they began Aug. 25. They are to resume in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in late March or early April with a meeting of Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and his Iraqi counterpart, <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>. Last week, Iranian foreign ministry officials met with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials to present their views on the talks. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> proposed Sunday that the nations exchange all 100,000 prisoners of war under the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Convention, which calls for the repatriation of prisoners after active hostilities cease. The exchange would be separate from the peace talks to allow for progress even if the negotiations remain deadlocked, he said. The talks became deadlocked when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> demanded that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> withdraw its troops from 260 square miles of Iranian territory. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> refused and countered that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> must relinquish its right to search ships in international waters for weapons bound for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has not searched any ships since the cease-fire took effect.

<TEXT>
 Text of statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, as translated from Arabic by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: In the name of the Almighty. After a thourough reading of `` The Satanic Verses'' book and its contents that insult Islam and the Arab prophet, and after examining the study of the so-called <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> declares that it has completed its preparations to execute the just sentence issued by the esteemed cleric and the great struggler <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. Hence, it puts forward the following evidence for carrying out the sentence: 1 _ Insulting Islam and the Arab prophet is an insult to the latest and greatest human civilization represented by revolutionary Islam. 2 _ <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s record indicates that he was a branch member of the Freemasons' movement in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Immediately after the publication of his `` Satanic Verses'' book, he was promoted to full official membership of the Freemasons' highest council in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> -LRB- or the church of organized atheism -RRB- which combats divine religions, especially christianity and Islam and their great prophets. 3 _ Imam <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, with his acute awareness of the grave consequences against the future of the divine religions emanating from this Freemasonic and Zionist attack, has handed down his verdict when the Arabs and those who claim to be the protectors of Islam and speak for all the Moslems remained in tight silence. The <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> also declares that before taking any measures it will find itself compelled to attack British police posts assigned to protect <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> in order to get to him to carry out the sentence. We hold the British government responsible in advance for the human and material losses among the British police and their posts that could result from the attacks on them. This warning applies to all countries that are currently negotiating with the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government to extend asylum and protection to <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. Victory to the oppressed, Glory and immortality to the martyrs. The Revolutionary Justice Organization.

 Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, announced today he will vote to confirm former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as secretary of defense but <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he said he still had the votes to defeat the nomination. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the 1988 Democratic vice presidential candidate, became the third <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senator to break party ranks and thow his weight behind the embattled nominee. `` We have seen every imperfection in an essentially good man dragged into the pitiless glare of television lights ...,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` It has been a high price to pay for public service. I will vote for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s confirmation.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told reporters earlier in the day that no matter what decision <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> made, the Democrats `` still have ample votes to reject confirmation.'' He urged Republicans to permit a swift vote, but GOP Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> declared: `` We do n't want to prolong the debate _ we want to win.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> did not directly dispute <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s claim. `` We're not certain,'' he said. `` It's going to be a very close vote.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who served in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> with his fellow Texan, said he was impressed with Tower's pledge not to drink if confirmed to head the Pentagon. `` I doubt that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> could get by with putting an olive in a glass of milk. The scrutiny of his life is going to be so intense that he may wish he had never sought out this job,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, who had been listed by some Republicans as a potential swing vote, announced earlier that he will vote against <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> because he has come to believe the relationships Tower forged with defense contractors after leaving government service pose `` at least the appearance of conflict of interest.'' `` In this case, I do believe it's in the nation's best interests for the president to make another choice,'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey indicates 48 Democrats and Republican <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> as either firmly opposed to the nomination or leaning in that direction, and 40 Republicans and three Democrats either firmly in favor or leaning that way. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said he had talked by telephone earlier today with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who continues to support Tower He said he would continue the effort to `` attract enough Republicans and Democrats to support the nomination'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> thus set the stage for a fifth day of debate on the nomination, which has produced frayed tempers and unusual personal outbursts on both sides of the struggle. `` I know this debate has been longer than most but this is unprecedented. We do n't want to prolong the debate _ we want to win,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was asked if he is disturbed that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> may be damaged by the debate's increasingly bitter and personal tone. `` Yes I am,'' he replied. `` I think the way to end it is to vote. Letters are coming in saying, `` Enough is enough _ this has gone on too long.'' `` I believe enough time has been devoted to this matter,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. Republicans now hope to convert other undecided Democrats, concentrating their efforts on a handful of lawmakers. These include Sens. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, D-Conn.; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, D-Va., and <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today that the central focus of the debate is the claim by Republicans that Tower should be approved `` because the president is entitled to have his own man.'' But he said Tower himself, while serving in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, repeatedly voted against presidential nominees `` simply because he disagreed with some of their positions.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> suggested many senators of both parties have reversed position on the proper stance to take on nominees because of the shift of the political winds. `` I predict that if ever and when there is a Democratic president they -LRB- Republicans -RRB- will reverse position again,'' he said. `` Do not get locked into your present views,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` You may be holding another view very soon.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., the deputy <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leader, said after a meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that an `` excellent opportunity'' remains to pick up the Democratic votes needed to push the nomination over the top `` There is n't any question in my mind that we indeed have the opportunity to get him confirmed,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> left open the possibility of asking the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to permit Tower to answer the allegations against him from the floor of the chamber. But Democrats said that would set `` an awful precedent'' for future confirmation battles and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> appeared to concede he would make that move only as a last resort. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> called it a `` desperation tactic.'' `` I do believe enough is enough,'' he said. `` Why will the proponents of the nomination not permit a vote?'' Democrats control the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by a 55-45 margin. On Tuesday, Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., recalling Tower's vote against the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> censure of his father for improper use of campaign funds 22 years ago, said he would vote for <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said that although he and his family will be `` eternally grateful'' for Tower's defense of the late Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., his decision did not rest on personal considerations He said that reading the file of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation into Tower's past, he believes evidence is too thin to support a vote to bar the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator from becoming defense secretary. That evidence involves allegations _ many of them disputed _ that Tower drank excessively, displayed improper behavior toward women and permitted the appearance of conflict of interest to develop in the lucrative links he forged with giant defense contractors after leaving government service. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'s decision to support Tower follows that of Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala. Together they dilute what had been a solid party line split for and against the nomination.

<HEAD>Development Groups Said Responsible for 90,000 Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Private, non-profit development groups based in poor communities appear to have created or saved almost 90,000 jobs in the last five years, according to a survey of those groups by their association released Wednesday. The groups have multiplied rapidly from their beginnings in the 1960s and have grown from 200 or so in the mid-1970s to probably 1,500 to 2,000 today, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. More than 800 groups participated in the congressional survey, the first of its kind, which was completed late last year. Altough found in all states, these `` community-based development organizations'' are particularly active where they may receive state assistance, notably in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Many groups concentrate on housing for the poor; 458 reported completing more than 23,000 housing units in 1986 and 1987. The organizations reported lending money to 2,048 enterprises, owning shares in 218 and operating 427 they owned. Most loans and share investments were for less than $ 25,000. Responding groups reported development of 16.4 million square feet of retail space, offices, factories and other facilities in poor communities.

<TEXT>
 Foreign ministers of 35 nations ended a three-day meeting Wednesday and stressed that a new round of arms talks should focus on increasing trust as well as reducing weapons. The talks opening Thursday could clear <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> of many of the troops and conventional weapons massed between the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and the Urals in the four decades since the Cold War. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposed the talks focus first on imbalances and reductions in tanks, artillery and armored personnel carriers. It says the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> has a 2-1 edge in such weapons. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> proposed broader talks, saying he wants existing imbalances removed and then a 10 percent to 15 percent cut in troops and all kinds of weaponry, including combat airplanes, over the next two to three years. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, which is not a member of either military bloc, on Wednesday backed <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s proposal. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> says it wants to focus first on the tanks and other weapons that could be used in a surprise land attack. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> on Monday proposed huge cuts in troops and weapons and further talks to strip the continent of battlefield nuclear rockets. But Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and other Western officials rejected the Soviet suggestion, hinting they viewed it as a ploy t interrupted supply lines, he said. The wage deferral was approved by more than 80 percent of employees, an action that <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> said indicated strong faith in the future of the business. A wage increase scheduled to take effect next fall also will be deferred. The plan calls for the workers to get half of their deferred wages back in December, and the other half is to be returned next February. The Company Store mails about 25 million catalogs annually, employs more than 1,000 workers in its busy season, and had 1988 income of about $ 100 million.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it has no evidence a Japanese aerospace company installed equipment at a suspected Libyan chemical weapons plant, while President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman said `` all aspects'' of the plant are being investigated The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> had reported that <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> had a team of 50 technicians and engineers at the complex in the desert south of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. The company is also involved in a proposed joint venture with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to build a jet fighter, the `` FSX.'' The deal was negotiated during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and is now under review by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration _ with a decision imminent. Despite the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> denial, the report on alleged involvement by the Japanese company in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> raised new concerns in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the proposed joint venture. And an administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that although indications earlier in the week appeared to favor <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approval of the jet fighter project, within the past few days prospects had become `` very fluid.'' As a result, a final recommendation by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may not be ready by a Friday deadline suggested by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the official said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> told reporters that news stories of a Japanese company being involved with the Libyan plant surfaced last summer and that the Japanese government informed <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> authorities at the time that it had received assurances further Japanese involvement was not contemplated. Those assurances are still valid, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. Earlier Wednesday, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration is investigating `` all aspects'' of the plant. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, while declining to comment directly on the story, said the plant is `` the matter of the utmost concern to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and we have raised it in any number of forums.'' Meanwhile, Rep. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, D-Calif., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a critic of the proposed joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION>, called for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to delay his decision `` In light of recent press allegations ... we strongly urge that the decision on the plan to sell technology to <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> for the development of the FSX aircraft be put on hold until this new matter is thoroughly investigated,'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said in a letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> was in fact involved in the chemical weapons facility, it would raise very serious questions about proceeding with the FSX agreement under which billions of dollars of sensitive American defense technology would be transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said. The Detroit News, quoting unidentified congressional and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources, said Japanese experts had installed metal-machining equipment used to make bomb canisters for poison gas. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the matter was raised briefly during a morning meeting between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional Republican leaders. `` It is being looked into from all aspects by our intelligence services and investigative bodies,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said so far the investigations had yielded `` no conclusions we're willing to discuss at this point.'' <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> is also involved in a proposed joint venture with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to build a jet fighter, the so-called FSX. The venture was negotiated during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and is now under review by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration _ with a decision imminent. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked whether the new allegations would affect a presidential decision on the FSX project, said only that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not yet made a final decision on the project. Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> would join forces to build the jet fighters, a version of the F-16. Critics in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have labeled the project an $ 8 billion giveaway of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> high technology and have called on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to cancel <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation. The Japanese government says it needs a final go-ahead from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by March 31 to get funds for the project into its current budget. Congressional sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the administration has been expected to give the project the go-ahead, but with some safeguards to make sure that sensitive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons technology is not transferred to the Japanese. The Detroit News story said that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> briefed members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on the Mitsubishi-Libyan connection during a closed-door meeting last week.

<HEAD>Opinions Vary on Continuing Import Curbs</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The president of the Steelworkers union and a steel executive called Wednesday for extending steel-import restraints, while a group of steel users called the curbs `` the worst possible form of protectionism.'' A debate sponsored by the private <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> brought together advocates and opponents of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s five-year `` voluntary restraint'' program, which was negotiated by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1984 and limits steel imports from 19 countries and the European Community. The import curbs expire Sept. 30. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged just before he was elected to continue the restraints in some form. But opponents of the plan believe they can make a case for ending it, or at least shortening the extension to less than five years and reducing its scope. There was no argument at Wednesday's debate that the annual, product-by-product, country-by-country import ceilings have aided the steel industry's revival. Imports have been reduced to about 20 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, and employment and profits were up last year over 1987. The issue is whether the restraints are still necessary, and to what degree they have harmed other sectors of the American economy. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, chairman of a coalition of 1,000 manufacturers that rely on steel products, said the curbs have meant higher steel prices and poorer product availability. `` Instead of growth and profitability through competitiveness, our steel industry has a ` circle-the-wagon' strategy of limiting supply through trade protection in order to raise prices,'' said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Trans-Matic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, president of the steel division of <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said most of his company's customers accept the need for continued import protection. `` If we lacked customer support, believe me, we would n't be here,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. `` Ninety-five percent of our customers are with us.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry says it lost $ 11.6 billion from 1982 to 1986. The problem, Steelworkers President <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, is that the conditions that spawned the restraints _ large subsidies by overseas governments to support steel firms _ have not changed. `` Just as we begin to catch up _ and we're a long way _ the worst thing in the world would be to choke off this growth,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has been investigating the effect of the ceilings on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel-consuming industries. Its report later this year is expected to be an important part of the debate over whether the administration should keep the program intact in its present form.

 A teacher who fought nine years to win her fiance's release from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has filed for annulment after nine months of marriage, alleging he used her simply to get into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>, a high school language teacher, and <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON>, had been reunited on the eve of the 1988 Reagan-Gorbachev superpower summit. <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>, 45, met <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON>, 56, in 1967 while studying in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. She returned to visit him and they made plans to marry, but <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> officials refused to let <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> leave. In 1979, <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> began lobbying for his release by writing letters and contacting politicians. They were married May 28 in a backyard ceremony to the strains of `` <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>'s Theme'' from the movie `` Dr. Zhivago.'' They exchanged vows in Russian. <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> filed a complaint Feb. 3 in <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Probate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, alleging <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> encouraged her love and attention because he wanted to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The complaint also said the marriage was never consummated. <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>, who teaches at <ORGANIZATION> Woburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, moved <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> into the four-bedroom home she shares with her mother. <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON>, a chemist, began taking English lessons in an effort to begin practicing his profession. But <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> moved out Jan. 22 into the home of his wife's brother, according to The Daily Evening Item of <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> The newspaper reported that <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> was upset that <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> did not contribute to household expenses. <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> has asked the court to declare the marriage annulled, which would return <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> to his former status as an alien. Federal immigration officials said <PERSON> Novikov </PERSON> could be in trouble if it's found that he entered the country fraudulently. `` He could be deported,'' said <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not that automatic and there's a process to be followed, but that's grounds for deportment. <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> did not immediately return a call to her school Wednesday. No telephone listing was available for her brother's home. When contacted by the Item on Wednesday, <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said: `` I do n't know why you are calling about this I am late to school. It is snowing outside. I have no comment.''

<HEAD>Central Americans Using Smugglers to Sneak Into the United States</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Central Americans fleeing their war-torn homelands have begun using smugglers to take them deep into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to evade tighter rules and heavier border patrols, officials said Wednesday. Other refugees, out of money for bribes and payments, say they can only wait and hope the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crackdown that began Feb. 21 will ease. `` There's been a large increase in smuggling people,'' said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, assistant chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` They've resorted to going through smugglers to see if they're able to get them farther into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON>, a supervisor of the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>'s intelligence unit, said there are 1,500 to 2,000 Central Americans on the Mexican side of the border waiting to cross, up from 200 to 300 before the new policy went into effect. Until Feb. 21, refugees could enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the nearest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> point to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Most applied for political asylum and lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> until their status was determined. But the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said most refugees have experienced economic hardship and need not fear political persecution. In an effort to stem the flow, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> began interviewing refugees as soon as they crossed the border. In the first week, the agency granted only 16 of 370 petitions for asylum, and detained the others pending deportation proceedings. The result was a backup in this town just south of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, as some Central Americans fled the threat of detention in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and others searched for a new, and illegal, way across the border. <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON> said smuggling cases detected in the area have doubled from four to eight a day. Most of the refugees are trying to reach <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, from which they can travel to other parts of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` A lot them are transported to just before a checkpoint and dropped off. They walk around the checkpoint and are picked up on the other side,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. The checkpoints are surrounded by farmland, and <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said it's impossible to monitor all the river crossings. Meanwhile, many Central Americans said that while crossing the river has become tougher, paying smugglers to take them to other crossing points or further into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not an option. `` We came and we've found that we ca n't get in, that there are new laws and now we're trapped here without money and we ca n't cross,'' said <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON> <PERSON> Saavedra </PERSON>, 45, a Nicaraguan at the <ORGANIZATION> Casa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION>, a Roman Catholic-run shelter for the poor She said she had been waiting 13 days with her 80-year-old mother. They tried paying a smuggler $ 30, but the `` coyote'' abandoned them on a riverbank outside <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>. `` If we can, we'll try again. If not, we'll go back to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>,'' where they went after they first left <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, said her mother, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>. A Nicaraguan woman named <PERSON> Yolanda </PERSON>, who refused to give her last name, said she fled for several reasons. She said she was n't being paid enough for long hours at a child welfare center and was being harassed because of her friendship with a rebel leader fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government. She left her husband and two children behind, but took her 12-year-old son along because he is close to draft age. A shelter worker said the shelter's population had shot up to 60, all but three Central Americans, in recent days. `` They are waiting for a better time to pass when there is less surveillance,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said 40 to 50 people also left the shelter this week, saying they were going home. Mexican immigration authorities were not bothering the Central Americans, he said. At a small hotel in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, a 31-year-old Mexican who frequently takes people across the border said he was finding it `` very, very difficult.'' The man, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the group of a dozen with him were all Mexicans; however, members of the group spoke with Central American accents and a hotel worker said they were Hondurans. Many Central Americans identify themselves as Mexicans so they will be returned to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and not be deported to their homelands. The group said it was down to its last $ 1.50. Asked about other border points, such as <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION>, 2,000 miles away in <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> said: `` You know what it would cost to go to <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION>? 110,000 pesos,'' about $ 47. He said he prefers taking people across in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> because it's closer to jobs in the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We're going to wait to see if they go to sleep,'' he said of the Border Patrol. `` And if not we're going to cross and maybe they'll catch us.''

 A German physicist and a pathbreaking Scottish minister were named as 1989 co-winners Wednesday of the world's most valuable prize, the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion. The prize this year is $ 435,000. It was the first time the prize has been divided between two winners. A spokesman said judges split in this 17th year of the award. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON>, 76, of <LOCATION> Starnberg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, was cited for initiating talks between scientists and religious scholars and for research into links between physics, cosmology and theology. The Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON>, 92, of <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, was named for his founding of the <ORGANIZATION> Iona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, an ecumenical center of prayer, peacemaking and work. The winners were announced at the Church Center for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The prizes will be presented privately at <LOCATION> Buckingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> May 10 and publicly in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on June 10. In statements, <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> said he would `` use half of the money for direct action against hunger and the other half for work for peace.'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> said his share would go to furthering relationships between science and faith. The founder of the prize, American investment counselor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Templeton </PERSON>, said the international panel of judges picks winners on the basis of their originality in advancing the `` love and understanding of God.'' He said the prize is deliberately kept larger than others, such as the Nobel prizes in science and literature, to indicate that `` progress in religion is more important than progress in any other field.'' `` The accelerating discovery rate in natural sciences needs to be matched by man's spiritual progess and discovery,'' he said. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizaecker </PERSON>, credited for several discoveries in nuclear physics, initiated talks in 1949 at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gottingen </ORGANIZATION> between long-hostile disciplines of science and religion and later at other institutions. <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON>, a Church of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> clergyman, started the innovative <ORGANIZATION> Iona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> on an island off the west coast of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> in 1938 and it has since become a much-visited and influential center. For its monastic-type discipline, <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> set a simple, five-fold rule of daily prayer and Scripture study, tithing, peacemaking and responsible work and service.

<HEAD>US Criticizes Chinese Use of Force Against Tibetans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expressed concern Wednesday about the continued violence in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and criticized the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government's use of force against pro-independence demonstrators. `` While we recognize the right of a government to maintain order, we object to the unwarranted use of lethal force,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>. After three days of anti-Chinese rioting, official reports have put the death toll in the violence at 12. But Tibetans say far more have been killed, most shot to death by security forces. The unrest, the latest in an 18-month series of demonstrations, has developed into the most serious challenge to Chinese rule in nearly three decades. Thousands of Chinese troops have converged on <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, the remote Tibetan city where martial law was declared Tuesday after three days of anti-Chinese rioting. The disturbances began on Sunday, when demonstrators protesting Chinese rule began rioting, stoning police and building bonfires of goods looted from Chinese-owned stores. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, asked about the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s reaction, noted that he has spoken on the matter several times recently. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had approached the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> about the problem. `` We stressed a concern in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over human rights in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, deplored the violence which has led to many deaths and injuries, and asked for an assessment of developments in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and the likely duration of martial law,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` While we recognize the right of a government to maintain order, we object to unwarranted use of lethal force.''

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Western donors Wednesday urged the government to end a six-year civil war threatening thousands with starvation, and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> said it will halt economic aid unless the government starts peace talks. Apparently responding to those and internal pressures, Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> on Wednesday sent his interior minister, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> for talks with the southern rebels. But the move is unlikely to produce results. The <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> refused to talk to <PERSON> Fadil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> on a recent similar mission because they maintain the government first must endorse a tentative peace agreement reached Nov. 16 Earlier Wednesday, <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> told a conference in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> that his government welcomes a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> call for a month's cease-fire to permit delivery of emergency relief to more than 2 million people facing starvation in rebel - and government-held parts of southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> `` The problem is whether we can get the other side to accept this temporary stop for relief efforts,'' <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said. He was speaking at a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> conference of Western donor countries and relief agencies organizing the $ 137.7 million emergency operation. So far $ 45 million has been pledged for food and medication mostly available in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> operation aims at a massive deployment by air, trains, trucks and <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> barges to get to 165,000 tons of relief supplies in the south before the rainy season starts in May and isolates the area for at least six months. The rebels, who want the mostly Moslem government to grant political and economic reforms to the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and animist south, have hampered relief efforts by attacking planes and trains escorted by military personnel. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> says 100,000 people could die if the operation fails. Other relief officials say it could be 600,000. Last year, at least 250,000 southerners died, many isolated by the rainy season. Canadian Ambassador <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Filleul </PERSON> spoke bluntly at the opening of the two-day Conference for Donor Countries and Organizations for Emergency Relief Operations. `` In absence of a settlement and national reconciliation, we will reconsider continuing our other assistance,'' he said, emphasizing <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> would continue humanitarian aid. <PERSON> Filleul </PERSON> criticized the Sudanese government for failing to carry through on a peace proposal negotiated in November between the rebels and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, then senior coalition partner in <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s government. Later, he told reporters <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> would cut its economic aid unless the government took steps toward peace. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> budgeted $ 56 million for <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> this year, $ 37.5 million of it in emergency humanitarian aid. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> were among other participants that pledged to maintain humanitarian aid to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, but did not refer to economic assistance. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> halted economic aid to <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> in January 1988 because the government owed $ 74 million in arrears on military and economic debts, according to <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's foreign disaster assistance program. Humanitarian aid amounting to $ 62 million was maintained between February 1988 and February 1989, she said. `` There will never be an end to the suffering until there is peace,'' <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> emphatically denied his government was using food as a weapon in the conflict, an accusation also leveled at the rebels. `` We want to dispel this wicked image of the government using food as weapons and being callous to the needs of its civilians'' said <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>. In a related development, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> said a cargo plane failed to arrive Wednesday in <LOCATION> Entebbe </LOCATION>, delaying the start of a major airlift of food to the besieged southern Sudanese town of <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> said a C-130 Hercules chartered from the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, apparently was having technical difficulties.

 Participants in an interfaith conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> said Wednesday the dialogue between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is off to a slow start but has given impetus to the idea of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. `` It is self-evident that there has n't been much of a dialogue,'' said <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauser </PERSON>, an international attorney who played a role in encouraging the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to talk with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders. She said none of the discussions between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> have been `` substantive.'' `` This has given a great deal of concern to many of us because obviously the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is getting very frustrated as are other people,'' she said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has said that its policy on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is under review. In December, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration decided to drop a 13-year ban and open talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Five meetings have been held in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Hauser </PERSON> said she believes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government has `` signaled that it is not prepared to renounce the dialogue'' and is engaged in `` a fairly nuanced and sophisticated approach to the question in anticipation of a substantive dialogue.'' Rabbi <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertzberg </PERSON>, a professor of religion at <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, agreed that the contact with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has been `` modest,'' but declared, that `` no matter what may happen to it as diplomatic games of one kind or another are played, once the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has met with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, a Palestinian state exists.'' `` When it will exist is a question of time, but the meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has to be understood in historic context as accepting the proposition on the American side that there is a national movement called the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> are the people to talk with.'' The two-day conference, involving Christians, Jews and Moslems, is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interreligious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. In a statement, the committee said it supports `` the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people's right of self-determination, including the option of an independent state in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> pledged to live in peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' A rival group, the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, handed out a flier at the meeting saying that none of its members had been invited to participate although <PERSON> Hertzberg </PERSON> and others who it said oppose its positions were among the speakers. The Jewish Committee on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> said it favors an end to `` huge economic and military subsidies'' of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It also said it is for `` mutual recognition between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the new State of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>.''

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on Wednesday defended its decision to bar mayors from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> from attending a drug conference in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, saying none of these countries can be counted on to cooperate in drug control efforts. The conference opened Wednesday without the presence of the mayors of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. `` The Americas Mayors' Conference: Drugs and Traffic'' will run through Friday, with daily panel discussions on various aspects of the drug problem. It is co-chaired by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> and Mayor <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> criticized the administration's decision, saying the conference represents `` an extraordinary opportunity'' for dialogue among public officials acutely affected by the drug problem. The decision to bar the mayor of <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> drew a sharp rebuke from Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who said that <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has indicated strong interest in cooperating on drug-control activities. <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview that the administration decision shows that `` drugs are not on the administration's foreign policy agenda'' despite strong public sentiment to the contrary. But <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the administration questions the seriousness of the three goverments `` to undertake anti-narcotics cooperation with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` In each of these cases, the mayors are in office with the sanction of the highest authorities in his or her government,'' he said. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> noted that normal travel in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by officials of the three countries has been suspended because of political differences each has with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. This restriction must be waived to allow visits by officials from any of the countries. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> noted that there have been several allegations of Nicaraguan government involving in drug smuggling. Last month, however, Nicaraguan officials offered to cooperate with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in curtailing drug trafficking through that country. <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>'s optimistic assessment of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s attitude was based on a December visit to <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> in which he and other committee members met with <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. At the time, <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> told the delegation he wants very much to cooperate with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Latin American countries in interdicting shipments of drugs. `` If they offer to cooperate, we ca n't afford to say no,'' <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said Wednesday.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> announced Wednesday it is expelling about 30 Iranians on security grounds because of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s death threat against novelist <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. The government also warned Britons to get out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Foreign Office said the 150 Britons in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are under `` increased threat'' from kidnappers following <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s severing of diplomatic relations Tuesday with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> over <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel, `` The Satanic Verses.'' Three Britons are among the 15 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. An Iranian newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Kayhan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said the diplomatic break `` will leave its negative impact on the fate of the British hostages.'' In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which holds two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostages, said it has completed plans to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> but will first attack <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> police to get to him. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, a British citizen who was born into a Moslem family, has been in hiding since Feb. 14, when <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> sentenced him to death for writing `` The Satanic Verses.'' <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> is believed to be under police guard in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> official said `` zealous'' Iranian students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pose the greatest threat toward publishers and others over the novel. Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is expelling the Iranians because of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s refusal to revoke the death sentence. `` We have therefore decided on security grounds a number of Iranians must be required to leave this country,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are keeping the activities of other Iranians under very close review.'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> also announced <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> ordered the closure of the Iranian consulate in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, a British colony. He said the staff had two weeks to leave. Using his strongest language since the controversy began, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> called the Iranian government a `` deplorable regime'' and did not rule out the possibility of ending all trade with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, saying, `` We stand ready to take whatever action may be necessary in the light of events.'' A break in economic ties would prevent <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> from winning lucrative contracts to help <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s postwar reconstruction, estimated to cost $ 500 billion. The move also comes at a time when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had been seeking to expand its ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said up to 30 Iranians `` who are held to be close to the regime'' will be expelled soon. There are about 25,000 Iranians in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, including 2,400 students. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> severed relations with a week after demanding <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> denounce <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and ban his novel, which Moslems say blasphemes Islam. <ORGANIZATION> Kayhan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and another <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Abrar </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> may cut ties with nations that supported <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and recalled their envoys. These include <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 11 <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> partners as well as <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abrar </PERSON> also called for an end to economic ties with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. British officials said Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government has no plans to stop trade with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> But one senior official said, `` If the Iranians want to start a trade war, we reckon they would lose.'' In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> advised Britons not to travel to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> `` as a result of the issue of author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>.'' It urged those in the country to leave as soon as possible. The warning was broadcast by the Christian-run Voice of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> radio. The British hostages _ <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, and teacher <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> _ all are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems. The pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which holds Americans <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, said Wednesday it has `` completed its preparations to execute the just sentence issued'' by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> also declares that before taking any measures, it will find itself compelled to attack British police posts assigned to protect <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> in order to get to him,'' the statement added. It was accompanied by a photograph of <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, but it did not threaten hostages. A Foreign Office spokesman said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> took the threat seriously. `` I do n't think we can do more than remain in a state of preparedness. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> will continue to have the full protection of the law,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigator, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> `` Buck'' <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> hearing thousands of `` zealous'' Iranians in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally or on student visas could be a bigger threat than those known to have links to terrorist networks. This is because they are not monitored and because the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s standards for issuing visas are lax, he told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations subcommittee on terrorism.

 An <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> businessman complained to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday that staff members of the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had used heavy-handed tactics in trying to ban his only product, a metal worm-harvesting probe that uses electric currents. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> of <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, told the consumer protection subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that agency staff members also had acted in an underhanded fashion in their investigation of his product and had refused to discuss possible safety improvements. His problems, he said, showed that members of the commission should be `` equipped with business knowledge and experience, and most of all, what is lacking now, common sense.'' A safety commission spokesman declined substantive comment, but a commission member defended the agency's effort to get the product off the market, suggesting the device `` probably is against every known product standard in the civilized world.'' <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> and his wife operate P & amp; M Enterprises, producing the `` Worm <PERSON> Gett </PERSON>' r,'' a device to drive worms to the earth's surface. It is made up of two, six or 12 metal prongs inserted into the ground and connected to a common two-wire, 120-volt AC household circuit. The current flowing into the ground forces worms desired by fishermen to rise to the surface. <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> says no one has been killed or injured from the 30,960 probes he had sold at prices ranging up to $ 29.95 since starting the business six years ago, and only one person had been known to receive a shock. However, the commission staff, citing 20 deaths since 1980 from other probes, often home-made, says the `` Worm <PERSON> Gett </PERSON>' r'' instructions are inadequate and the device itself poses a good chance of a shock strong enough to kill. The commission voted in 1987 to seek the recall of the Worm <PERSON> Gett </PERSON>' r. But it failed to win a federal court order in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> last year to remove the device from the market. An administratve law judge is considering the commission staff's petition to declare the probe a `` substantial product hazard'' that the commission could ban. `` Though a space of 50 years exists, the storm trooper tactics of the SS and the safety Nazi tactics of the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> hold many things in common,'' <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> said. `` Attempts were made to compromise with the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION>. Shielding the product's metal probe was suggested by us; instruction changes and warnings were offered. None of these was acceptable,'' <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> said. He said commission investigators by subterfuge got access to his customer lists from his shipping company, and visited customers seeking information. This has caused some customers to cancel orders, he said. His appearance was arranged by Republicans on the subcommittee. Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, said, `` This instance of what appears to be an abuse of authority without a sufficient factual basis is of interest because it was one of the prime reasons why the commission was not re-authorized last year.'' The commission and its staff were vigorously defended by <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pittle </PERSON>, a former commission member who is now technical director of <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, publisher of Consumer Reports. `` During the nine years I was a commissioner, at least five manufacturers of worm probes ... voluntarily agreed to take the remedial action the commission deemed appropriate,'' <PERSON> Pittle </PERSON> said. `` As an electrical engineer who has spent the last 20 years designing, testing and evaluating consumer products, I continue to believe that selling products that can predictably place live electrodes in the bare hands of consumers is wholly unreasonable _ and probably is against every known product standard in the civilized world.'' `` In my view, the commission and its staff acted correctly in trying to remove this hazard from the market,'' <PERSON> Pittle </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiflet </PERSON> said he could not comment in substance because the case was still before an administrative law judge, except to say, `` A settlement offer from Mr. <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> was never sent to the administrative law judge as required by our procedures.''

 A group of Japanese scientists and technicians began talks Wednesday with Nicaraguan officials on the possible construction of a canal across <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The six-member private delegation met with a government committe, headed by Finance Minister <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hupper </PERSON>, at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday morning. Reporters were not allowed access to the group. Barricada, the official newspaper of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government party, said the Japanese group inclues specialists in maritime law, ecology, engineering, architecture and lumber. It said the delegation arrived Tuesday night in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> but did not say how long it would remain in the Central American cuntry. The Japanese Embassy in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> has said the Japanese government is not involved in the delegation or the canal project. The idea of building a canal across <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to connect the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> oceans has been around since the late 1800s, but <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was chosen instead for the construction of the canal. The Nicaraguan government, when it announced in early February the formation of a committee to start feasibility studies, said it welcomed private or public investment from other countries.

 As if planning the national battle against illegal drugs was n't enough work, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saddled <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> with another controversial job: figuring out what to do about semiautomatic assault rifles. `` How does he feel about becoming gun czar?'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, said Wednesday `` He's not too upset about it.'' In fact, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> met Wednesday with <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> representatives, a meeting that had been scheduled before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced Tuesday that he had asked his designated drug policy director to find a solution to the weapons problem, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. It's not clear whether <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> will incorporate his recommendations into the national drug control strategy due 180 days after he is confirmed as director of national drug control policy or if he will issue a separate recommendation, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. Asked Wednesday what <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> representatives were discussing, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said, `` I think he's seeking input and advice. I'm rather confident he has not made up his mind. `` He's interested in seeing that firepower out of the wrong hands,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. `` He's concerned with the problem and he'd like to seek a solution that's consonant with the Constitution and individuals' rights concerning firearms But he does n't want to see that firepower in the hands of drug traffickers and other bad guys.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which held two days of hearings on <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s nomination last week, is scheduled to vote on it Thursday. There was little opposition raised during the hearings and he was expected to be approved by the committee, then approved by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, possibly as soon as Friday. The weapons in question are semiautomatic adaptations of AK-47s and Uzis. The tightly regulated military versions can switch back and forth from semiautomatic to automatic. A host of drug-related shootings and the killing of five <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> schoolchildren have prompted calls for a ban on the weapons with high-capacity ammunition clips. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>, has said he opposes such regulation, while first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supports a ban.

<HEAD>Americans See U.S. Second to Japan in Economic Power, Poll Says</HEAD>

 Americans by a two-to-one margin believe that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, not the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is now the leading economic power in the world, according to a public opinion poll released Wednesday. The poll, conducted by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, indicated that 59 percent of Americans now rank <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> first with only 29 percent choosing their own country. `` Our survey finds, beneath the surface of general economic contentment, much unease about the loss of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic power to foreign competition,'' said Gallup president <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON>. `` People see our ability to compete as declining in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years.'' On the other hand, the survey found that 72 percent of policy makers, executives and other opinion leaders still believe <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is the No. 1 economic power, a sharp difference with the general public. There was just as big a disagreement over the question of foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. An overwhelming majority of the public, 70 percent, saw foreign investment in very negative terms, with many fearing that foreigners are `` buying'' <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and threatening national security. But opinion leaders saw foreign investment as a vital source of capital for economic expansion. The survey, one of a series the Los Angeles-based news company has commissioned on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> attitudes, was conducted between Jan. 27 and Feb. 5. It included one-hour face-to-face interviews with 2,048 members of the general public and had a potential sampling margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points. A separate survey sampled the opinion of 250 government policy makers, corporate executives, Wall Street financiers and foreign investors in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. The survey of the general public, described as the most extensive ever on economic attitudes, indicated that 54 percent of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> expect things will be better for them financially next year and an additional 28 percent expected no change in their economic outlook. But they were much less optimistic about the nation's overall economic prospects. By sizable margins, the general public said it expected inflation to worsen and interest rates to be rise. Fully 76 percent said they expected taxes to be increased in 1989, despite President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` no-new-taxes'' campaign pledge The survey indicated that Americans strongly oppose increasing general income taxes although large majorities were willing to see higher taxes on tobacco, alcohol and on people with incomes over $ 80,000 a year. The poll indicated 85 percent of Americans favored raising taxes on alcoholic beverages to reduce the federal budget deficit, 75 percent favored boosting taxes on tobacco products and 64 percent were in favor of a national lottery to bring in revenues. Four out of five Americans, 82 percent, favored increasing the income taxes of people with incomes above $ 80,000. A smaller majority, 59 percent, endorsed a proposal to create a new 33 percent tax bracket for all income over $ 150,000. While calling the budget deficit a major problem, only 18 percent of Americans could come within $ 50 billion of guessing its size. Last year's deficit totaled $ 155.1 billion, but 28 percent guessed it was over $ 300 billion. Fears of war and international tension were as low as they have been in 40 years, the survey said. For example, 79 percent of the public feels that tensions with the Soviets have been reduced. As a reflection of the eased world tensions, the survey found strong sentiment for cutting the military budget. Asked how to reduce the federal budget by 5 percent, the public opted to take nearly half of the revenues from the defense budget. The public strongly opposed cuts in Social Security or Medicare to balance the budget.

 Energy Department negotiators should pressure the Japanese into sharing the $ 4.6 billion cost of the super collider as a way for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to pare its trade imbalance with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee considering the project said Wednesday. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the No. 1 -LRB- cost-sharing -RRB- suspect for us because of the bad balance of trade and -LRB- we should -RRB- approach them on that level,'' Rep. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> officials during a hearing on foreign participation in the proposed giant atom smasher. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said later that the trade imbalance with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would be a good lever in cost-sharing negotiations between officials of both countries. `` It gives us a special incentive to dealing with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, the chairman of the Science, <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on international scientific cooperation The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ran a trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of $ 55.4 billion in 1988, 40 percent of the total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit of $ 137 billion. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, deputy director of <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s energy research office, told Hall that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> holding `` unofficial, but very significant, discussions with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s high-energy physics community on possible ways of collaboration.'' <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said it is essential to `` encourage the enthusiastic support of the Japanese scientists because strong endorsement at this level is almost certainly a prerequisite for Japanese participation.'' But the involvement of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> may be ultimately be needed to convince the Japanese to invest in the project, <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said. Only <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has committed to helping build the super collider, agreeing to put $ 50 million into the project, a proposed 53-mile underground tunnel south of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in which beams of protons would smash into each other with 20 times the energy of today's most powerful accelerators. But neither foreign countries nor <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> will be willing to bankroll the project unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> commits to its construction, the panel was told by <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luce </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the state agency handling <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' role in the project. If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> goes along with the president and agrees to spend $ 250 million on the project in the fiscal 1990 budget, including $ 160 million for construction, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and foreign countries would read that as adequate commitment to the project, the officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is proposing $ 1.8 billion of the total cost come from non-federal sources, including $ 1 billion that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has promised to spend.

<HEAD>Iran Said To Be Building Missile Factory With Help from China</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is helping <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> build a factory to make surface-to-surface missiles with a range exceeding 500 miles, Western diplomatic sources said Wednesday. They said construction has gone ahead since a U.N.-mediated cease-fire halted the eight-year Iran-Iraq war on Aug. 20 and that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also is continuing to develop its chemical warfare capability. The sources, speaking on the condition of not being identified, said the missile factory is in northeastern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but they could give no details. One source remarked: `` It's a missile plant and the Chinese are lending support to build it. That much is known.'' <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> television, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s deputy prime minister, <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiyun </PERSON>, ended a five-day trip to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Tuesday. It made no mention of weapons, saying only that the visit concentrated on trade and industrial ties. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> both deny any arms deals, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other Western officials say <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been a main supplier of weapons for <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s regime. They estimated such sales at more than $ 1 billion. Among the arms supplied were two types of jet aircraft and the HY-2 Silkworm and C-801 anti-ship missiles, which have a range of less than 100 miles. The <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> government said a year ago it was building its own version of a `` foreign missile'' _ not further identified _ for use against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. According to the authoritative reference, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Weapons Systems, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s arsenal does not include a surface-to-surface missile with a 500 - to 600-mile range, but Western experts said then it would be relatively simple for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to have copied Soviet-designed Scud-B rockets acquired from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> The war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, its <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> neighbor, began in September 1980 and was marked by periodic missile bombardments of each other's population centers in what became known as the `` war of the cities.'' <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital, lies only 60 miles from the border, and so the initial advantage went to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Last spring, however, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> began using long-range missiles to hit <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and other areas of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> previously beyond range. Some analysts have said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s use of Scud-Bs with boosters to increase their 160-mile range was a major factor in forcing <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to agree to a truce.

 The strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> threatens to spread to several railroads if a federal judge's restraining order expires or is overturned. In that case, rail employees could observe <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees' picket lines Here are answers to some questions raised by the case: Q. Why could rail passengers be affected by an airline strike? A. Because Eastern's unions hope to bring pressure to bear on the airline and the government by extending the strike to other forms of transportation. Q. But is n't such a tactic _ a secondary boycott _ illegal under the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947? A. Yes, but the railroad and airline unions are covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, not Taft-Hartley. Q. Why are those unions outside the main body of labor legislation? A. Because in the 1920s the railroads had unparalleled power, wealth and political influence, and because their pay and mediation practices were different from everyone else's. Q. But why are airlines covered by the Railway Act? A. When <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> amended the Railway Act in 1934, the unions of the fledgling airline industry lobbied to be included. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> went along, although it may not have realized at the time how soon airlines would dwarf railroads in importance. Transportation unions in other industries, such as trucks and buses, are covered by the Wagner Act of 1935, which Taft-Hartley amended. Q. Why would n't <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> extend its policy against secondary boycotts to the Railway Act? A. The railway unions had much more political power immediately after World War II than they do today, so amending the act would have been problematic. The Railway Act, moreover, represented a compromise worked out by management and labor specifically for their industry; <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was reluctant to tamper with it. Q. How have other secondary boycotts turned out? A. Until 1947 they were one of organized labor's most potent weapons. The few secondary boycotts that have occurred since have been brief; either the president stepped in and imposed a cooling-off period, or judges stopped them, citing the public welfare. Q. What commuter rail lines might be struck if the judge does not bar a sympathy strike? A. Twelve commuter lines, in addition to <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, could be shut down. They are the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commuter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trans-Hudson </ORGANIZATION>, or PATH; the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>; the Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District; the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> and suburban <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> CalTrans </ORGANIZATION>, which operates between <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Tri-Rail </ORGANIZATION>, southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s new 67-mile rail system. Q. Metro-North and <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> are owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, a creature of the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. So why are n't the railroad employees governed by the state's <ORGANIZATION> Taylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>, which prohibits strikes by public employees? A. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has ruled that those workers are covered by the Railway Act, which preceded the Taylor Law. Q. Why has U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> issued an injuncton against the secondary boycott? Does n't the Norris-La Guardia Act bar such action by the federal judiciary in labor disputes? A. There is an exception for cross-industry secondary boycotts and strikes, reflecting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'s conviction that labor battles, including strikes, should be restricted to unions and companies in the same industry. Q. But since Eastern and the railroads are all covered by the same labor legislation, are n't they in the same industry? A. That's for the courts to say.

<HEAD>Developer of Vaccine for Monkeys Skeptical about Use for AIDS</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A scientist who developed a vaccine to protect monkeys against a virus distantly related to the one that causes AIDS cautioned Wednesday the work probably wo n't lead to an AIDS vaccine anytime soon. `` It would be foolish on my part to say, yeah, this opens up the way for a vaccine for AIDS,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>, a professor emeritus of veterinary pathobiology at <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Whether it would work for AIDS, I'd be very skeptical.'' However, one well-known AIDS researcher said he thought the monkey vaccine could be quite valuable in developing an AIDS vaccine. <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> graduate students last week announced preliminary success with a vaccine to immunize monkeys against the HTLV-1 virus. The vaccine uses an approach similar to that of a vaccine <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> developed several years ago, which veterinarians now use to protect millions of house cats from a deadly disease. That illness, called feline leukemia; the HTLV-1 virus, which causes adult T-cell leukemia and lymphoma; and the virus that causes AIDS all belong to the retrovirus family. Unlike other viruses, retroviruses become part of a chromosome, which carries genetic information. The AIDS virus has other characteristics in common with HTLV-1. Both can be transmitted through blood, sexual intercourse and contaminated needles, and HTLV-1 causes AIDS-like symptoms in monkeys. Some of the eight or so macaque monkeys vaccinated by <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>'s group and then exposed to HTLV-1 have gone as long as two years without their blood cells showing any signs of infection, <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> said All five or six monkeys in a control group that were exposed to the virus without being vaccinated eventually developed the illness, he said. <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> said his research during the next two years will attempt to prove the vaccine can prevent the virus from getting into a chromosome and lying dormant. `` You're in essence dealing with an agent that's adding new genetic material to the host chromosome,'' <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> said. The vaccine does not contain the virus, just `` pieces and parts'' of proteins that make up the virus, <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolognesi </PERSON>, a virologist and professor of experimental surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said he was not familiar with <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>'s work but that a vaccine against HTLV-1 virus would be significant in terms of AIDS research `` Any vaccine against any member of the retrovirus family is of enormous value,'' <PERSON> Bolognesi </PERSON> said. Asked about the adaptability of a vaccine from monkeys to humans, <PERSON> Bolognesi </PERSON> said, `` That's pretty close. It's a good model. I would say the transition to man ... would not be too difficult.'' <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> State researchers are in their fourth year of research on the HTLV-1 vaccine. <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> plans to open a <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retrovirus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> next month, using university money and royalties from the cat vaccine, but <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> said his group would not try to work with the more volatile AIDS virus for at least a couple of years. `` We're going to finish what we've got, do well with what we've got, before jumping into other things,'' he said `` The AIDS virus changes very rapidly,'' he said. `` The HTLV-1 virus is far more stable genetically.'' He explained that drawing blood from 10 people and growing the HTLV-1 virus in tissue cultures would result in little or no difference in the virus from person to person. Doing the same thing with the AIDS virus would produce different results from person to person, <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> said. `` That's what's going to make the -LRB- AIDS -RRB- vaccine thing very difficult,'' he said.

 Mourners wore blue ribbons Wednesday to symbolize commitment to battered women as they laid to rest a woman who police say was bludgeoned to death by her former husband while he was on a prison furlough. `` In a world filled with people who care only for themselves, she was a person who cared deeply for others,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> England </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> during funeral services at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>, 29, a battered wife before divorcing in 1985, last year became a counselor to battered women at an <LOCATION> Elkhart </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> shelter. She rose to program director. `` <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> listened to people who cried out,'' <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> said. `` She healed their wounds. Having experienced pain and hurt herself, she continued to love.'' Nearly 200 mourners, including Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>'s two daughters, ages 6 and 10, attended the services and burial at Chapel Hill Memorial Gardens in <LOCATION> Osceola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said a decision whether to seek the death penalty against Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>'s former husband, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON>, 38, would be made next week. <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> is being held without bail on murder charges. <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON>, who was serving an eight-year prison term for beating Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> and criminally confining their children in 1987, was released Saturday from the <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complex </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION> on an eight-hour pass. Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> was beaten to death with the butt of a shotgun Saturday outside her <LOCATION> Mishawaka </LOCATION> home, police said. The force of at least 20 blows to her head shattered the weapon's wooden stock. <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> was arrested later that day. Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> had asked Department of Correction officials to notify her if <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> was released, friends and family members say. Two prison officers have been suspended without pay for approving the furlough and failing to notify her. Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> immediately suspended the furlough program pending a review. The shelter's Wednesday evening counseling session, which Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> was to have attended, was to be held in her honor, said shelter director <PERSON> Michalyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chilcote </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> had recently joined the <ORGANIZATION> Mishawaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the Status of Women, which will lobby the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to improve laws to protect victims of domestic violence, said its president, <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Mishawaka </LOCATION>, urged people to wear blue ribbons to symbolize their commitment, as well as his sister's, to helping battered women. Blue was her favorite color, he said. `` Let the people who make the laws know we need changes,'' he said. `` We need more help for battered women's shelters.'' A memorial fund was set up in her name by the women's shelter. In an interview videotaped by prosecutors two years ago, a badly bruised Ms. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> said <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> had threatened to beat her and take the couple's two children. He said `` he would make my life so miserable that I would wish daily that I was dead,'' she said. `` I bartered for my life yesterday and told him that I would not prosecute,'' she continued. `` I'm afraid if he does get a hold of me again that I'm not going to be able to talk about it.''

 <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>'s police chief, said Wednesday that medical researchers should find a way to immunize youngsters so they wo n't get high on drugs and thus would avoid becoming involved in the narcotics trade that has contributed to a crime wave here `` I believe the greatest contribution the medical community of this great nation could ever conceive for our children would be the development of an inoculation or vaccine that would block the euphoria or high our youth receive from smoking, ingesting or injecting PCP, crack cocaine, cocaine or heroin into their bodies,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> told reporters. However, Dr. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, director of preclinical research at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>, said the idea of inoculation was `` theoretically possible'' but not practical. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said the prospect of inoculation brings up various ethical questions, such as whether `` anyone has the right to put someone on a drug or chemical or immunization that would prevent them from engaging in an activity.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s record homicide rate has followed the trend in other major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Canadian cities when the crack cocaine appeared on the drug-abuse scene, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said, and killings probably wo n't stop until drug dealers settle turf battles `` This city is one of the last cities where crack became the drug of choice,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. The city had a record 372 homicides in 1988, and police said about 70 percent were related to drugs. By Wednesday, 100 people had been slain in the city, compared with 55 at this time last year.

 <ORGANIZATION> Protesting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students Wednesday escalated their demonstration, disrupting classes and blocking the entrance of a site they thought was being used for temporary administrative offices. After learning they had succeeded in driving <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> from the school's board of trustees, the students focused their attention on other demands. `` At the top of the list is assurances that there will be no repercussions,'' said student leader <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Simms </PERSON>. `` We also want to see <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s resignation accepted in writing, and assurances of financial aid and better housing.'' Improved security and a graduate African studies program are also on the list of demands at the predominantly black campus. Students took over the administration building Monday to protest <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s appointment to the board of trustees. Howard President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheek </PERSON> has said the students' occupation of the administration building could stop faculty members from receiving their payroll checks, due Thursday. When the students learned the school planned to set up a temporary administrative office in the school's liberal arts building, they staged a sit-in just inside the entrance. However, after <PERSON> Simms </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>, he directed the students to leave the site. The group of 50 or so students then went on a nearby building and interrupted classes, chanting and yelling, before regrouping and returning to the administrative building. `` We're trying to rally more support,'' <PERSON> Simms </PERSON> said. `` And we will continue to disrupt classes and this university until we can open some lines of communication.'' Earlier Wednesday, <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> delegate <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> met with the students in the administration building. `` I came for two reasons,'' <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> said. `` To get the details on the students' demands and to find out what they want met before leaving the building.''

<TEXT>
 Fire swept through an old five-story apartment building in this eastern town early Wednesday, killing 14 people and injuring 10, fire officials said. Four people were killed when they jumped from windows after being awakened by the predawn blaze, fire officials said. The 10 others died from burns or asphyxiation by the black smoke that engulfed the corridors. Firefighters, whose ranks swelled to 120, took more than two hours to put out the blaze near the train station in the center of the town 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Mulhouse </LOCATION>, near the Swiss border. The building, an old hotel transformed in 1982 into furnished studios, housed students at the <ORGANIZATION> Technological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sevenans </ORGANIZATION> as well as some workers and elderly. The cause of the fire was not immediately known. It was thought to have started in a third-floor stairwell. Defense Minister <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevenement </PERSON>, mayor of the town of 51,000, visited the scene Wednesday afternoon, listening to survivors who told him of the `` disastrous'' state of electrical wiring in the building. Four bodies were found in the ravaged building soon after the fire was extinguished, and the daylong search through the debris turned up six more bodies, according to rescue officials. Ten people were injured, four of them hospitalized, with one person in serious condition, according to the officials. A temporary morgue and medical station were set up in the nearby train station. It was not known how many of the building residents were present at the time of the fire, which fire officials said was <PERSON> Belfort </PERSON>'s worst since 1940

 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, in his first tough call since running for vice president last year, parted company with virtually all of his fellow <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats Wednesday in declaring he'll vote for fellow Texan <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as defense secretary. But his endorsement seemed to avoid putting personal prestige on the line for his former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleague or another <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> friend, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I hope that when I get the next chance to talk with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> about tough job of keeping this country strong, it will be while he's in his new office,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. His announcement ended weeks of silence on his part and speculation by others on whether <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> would side with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or with his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> colleagues. It came only after Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, predicted the votes were in place to defeat the nomination whatever <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s decision. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman and the man leading the opposition to Tower, walked over to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, touched his shoulder and shook his hand <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s decision was closely watched both because of his <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ties and because of the visibility he has held since he had the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket last fall. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has assumed the role of party heavyweight, delivering the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first speech to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and declaring his opposition to some of the administration's spending cuts and tax proposals. When Tower was nominated in January, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s vote for him seemed a sure thing. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> spoke warmly about his long-time colleague when he first presented Tower to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice for secretary of defense. He brushed aside as `` just politics'' the brutal attacks against Democrats by Tower during last fall's campaign. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> sought to reassure more liberal senators that the hawkish Tower was a good choice to hold down spending. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> is too much of a conservative to give a blank check from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> to the Pentagon,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. But as the showdown over the nomination grew in intensity, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> avoided the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate _ until Wednesday _ and kept quiet on how his vote would be cast. Republicans in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> became impatient, as did <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose calls included one during his Far East trip. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> spoke to the president `` on three or four occasions,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s spokesman. Tower supporters from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> pressured <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> with telephone banks and newspaper ads. One of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ads referred to him as `` <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Millard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'' _ a swipe at alleged snootiness derived from last year's campaign, when <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> referred to now-Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as `` <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.'' But friends and allies said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, re-elected to a six-year <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> at the same time he lost his vice presidential bid, felt little direct political pressure. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> reached his decision over the weekend, <PERSON> DeVore </PERSON> said. Fellow Democrats would understand <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> siding with Tower because Texans have `` a long tradition of closing ranks,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist who has been <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s top <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aide and was chief of staff for his vice presidential campaign. He also would have been safe politically if he had gone against Tower, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> friend and consultant who served as press secretary to President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` There is not a high degree of passion on either side in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. It's almost titillation rather than any comsuming passion in it,'' he said. The campaigns to influence <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> were `` wasting their money,'' he said. Tower supporters expressed relief at <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s announcement. `` I think that the timing would have been better if it came earlier in the debate. But at this stage, I'll take him any time I can get him,'' said Tower friend <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consultant who raised money for Tower's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaigns, said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s timing was `` on target'' for boosting the nomination. `` Waiting for one or two other people to do it and and then standing up and doing it helps build a little psychological momentum,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> is pulling up roots and moving out of the liberal stronghold of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, but a spokesman said Wednesday the arch-conservatives were driven away by prices, not politics. `` The aspects of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> that we could n't take was the expense to live here,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> at the group's headquarters in <LOCATION> Belmont </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb The group plans to close its Belmont and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, offices and consolidate operations in <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, by the fall. Reasons for the move include lower overhead and the fact that the new chief executive officer, <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bubolz </PERSON>, lives in <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Appleton </PERSON> also is near Grand Chute, hometown of Republican Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, which <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> termed `` a delightful piece of irony.'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> led investigations into alleged communist influence in the 1950s. The 31-year-old society, which once labeled President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> a `` dedicated, conscious agent of the communist conspiracy,'' has struggled financially for years, making a appeal for funds after founder <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H.W </PERSON>. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> died in 1985. `` If anybody in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> wants to say thank you to anybody for the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> moving in that area they can thank -LRB- Gov. -RRB- <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, they can thank Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> congressional delegation,'' said <PERSON> McManus </PERSON>, blaming the Democratic politicians for the high cost of living in the area. The society listed 1987 liabilities of $ 8.5 million in its latest filing with the state. The fund balance showed a loss of $ 7.8 million, compared with a starting deficit of $ 7.7 million. `` We have always been in debt. We always spent more money than we took in and we always had to go in and scramble,'' <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> said. Belmont town officials did n't return telephone calls Wednesday. News of the move prompted mixed reaction in <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the town was open to people of all views, but City Attorney <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> said he was worried that <PERSON> Appleton </PERSON>'s image would be hurt. `` We do n't expect everyone to welcome us with open arms,'' <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> said. `` But we mean him no harm nor do we mean harm to any American.'' <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, a candy maker, was one of 12 men who founded the society in 1958, convinced that leaders around the globe were secretly planning a world government. The society was named after an American intelligence officer who was killed by Chinese communists in 1945; <PERSON> Birchers </PERSON> consider him the first casualty of the Cold War. <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> said the socity has several tens of thousands of members.

 Former astronaut <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ride </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee Wednesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other nations in the world need to undertake a comprehensive study of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> in learn how to protect the planet from the destructive influences of humanity. Ride, the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman in space, said science now recognizes that activities of civilization `` have begun to affect the conditions of the planet'', but there is little fundamental understanding of how the Earth's weather, geology, oceans and ice react together to influence the environment. `` We do not yet understand how our planet works,'' she said. `` The Earth is a very complicated place. It has to be studied as a system.'' Ride said a project called Mission to Planet Earth would, for the first time, study the Earth in a way that would relate to each other all of the natural and human forces that influence the planet. She was one of three witness testifying in support of the project before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee on commerce, science and transportation. Sen. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., a member of the committee, said there is a need for the mission because humans are beginning to realize that industrial chemicals and gases released into the atmosphere have the potential of affecting life on the planet by changing the weather and climate He said most nations already recognize the need to halt release of chemicals that erode the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere, and that carbon dioxide and other gases from industry may be affecting the Earth's climate through the so-called `` greenhouse effect.'' The greenhouse effect is a planetary warming caused by certain gases in the atmosphere that trap heat from the sun. Most of these gases, such as carbon dioxide, are produced mainly by the burning of fossil fuels. Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, chairman of the committee, said that the costs for the mission have been estimated at $ 20 to $ 30 billion out to the year 2010. Ride said the cost would be about a billion dollars a year, and that foreign nations could pay a share. The former astronaut, who joined the faculty at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> after leaving <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, said Mission to Planet Earth would involve nine instrumented satellites, experiments aboard the proposed space station, science stations on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, and a data handling system that would analyze all of the collected information. Ride said that the project would require the cooperation and participation of all the Earth's nations. Some nations, she said, could provide at least two of the satellites and most countries could establish and operate ground monitoring stations to gather measurements from all over the globe. Another witness, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, said a coordinated effort between earth, space, ocean and atmospheric studies would be needed to understand how each element affects the weather, climate and rainfall on the planet. He said with a thorough study of Earth from a variety of perspectives would enable scientists within 20 years to make accurate predictions about weather, the changes in geology and climate, and how human actions affect the planet. <PERSON> Lennard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>, chief of space sciences at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said the agency already has made organizational steps toward starting a major effort to study Earth. He said specific plans will be presented to congress in June, including plans for satellites.

<TEXT>
 The dangers described in an <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> draft report on the effects of oil drilling on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s North Slope are misleading and no reason to delay oil exploration in more arctic areas, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee was told Wednesday. Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said the draft report, first described in a story in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, `` needs substantial work before its finished.'' `` It's not an objective portrayal,'' he said. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> staff, said the draft was a summary of a `` trip report'' after a visit to the coastal plain of the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- ANWR -RRB-, where oil exploration has been proposed. `` The problems which are documented in the report are activities which have been raised for not opening ANWR from the beginning,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. The draft <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> report said improper and careless management of chemical oil wastes on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s North Slope is seriously damaging the delicate tundra, the Times reported. The report said acres of tundra have been damaged by chemical spills, oil wastes seeping from drilling pads, stacks of leaking chemical drums, a mine flooded by a diverted river, overflowing waste disposal pits and failure to comply with federal regulations governing the handling of hazardous materials by oil companies in the <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> oilfields. ANWR, just east of the <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> fields, is considered a promising area for a strike that could produce up to 3.2 billion barrels of oil, but it also is the breeding ground for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest remaining herd of migratory caribou and the habitat for polar bears, musk oxen, wolves, arctic foxes, waterfowl and fish. Legislation that would allow exploratory drilling to begin is being debated by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, but no action has been taken. <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, in promoting the bill, said that since the drilling in <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> began, there have been advancements in technology that minimize damage to the environment. Furthermore, he said, if no oil is found, the area will revert completely to its natural state.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> once shrugged off the idea that his work on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras might get him in trouble, saying `` I do n't care if I have to go to jail for this, I do n't care if I have to lie to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' a witness testified at his trial Wednesday. Charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> include lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about his involvement in aid to the Contras at a time when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military help was banned. Conservative fund-raiser <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Channel </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> made the statement in a conversation with <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, after flying to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to brief the wealthy Texan on the situation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` The only thing that sticks in my mind is that <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> said what are you going to do? Do you mind getting into trouble?'' <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> testified. After <PERSON> North </PERSON> gave his answer, <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> `` chortled.'' Meanwhile, in a related Iran-Contra case, the trial of retired Vice Adm. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, formerly a national security adviser and <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s boss, was shifted from the court of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to that of Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> is presiding over the North trial, now in its fifth week. The testimony about <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> was part of a day-long recitation by <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> about putting <PERSON> North </PERSON>, then a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide, together with wealthy people for briefings about fighting in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> never personally solicited contributions. The former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel is charged with conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> as part of the money-raising efforts. `` He'd say if people wanted to give after he gave the briefing, they should give to someone else,'' said <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> under cross-examination by North lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. `` If someone said ` who do I make the check out to,' he said `` you make out the check to <PERSON> Spitz </PERSON>'s organization.'' `` Spitz'' is <PERSON> Channell </PERSON>'s nickname. His organization was called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION>. The organization was recognized by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> as a tax-exempt foundation, meaning contributions were tax-deductible. One of the 12 charges on which <PERSON> North </PERSON> is being tried says that instead of the money going for charitable works it went for Contra arms instead. `` I was aware we had varied from our mandate, but felt that could be resolved,'' said <PERSON> Channell </PERSON>, who said he'd assumed since they had been working with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the legal consel there would find a way to justify where the money had gone. <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> pleaded guilty on April 29, 1987, to depriving the government of tax revenue by using the foundation to solicit contributions for military equipment for the Contras. He has not been sentenced. He pledged under a plea-bargaining agreement to testify for the government whenever he was called on. Under questioning by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s attorney, he said he was proud of his work for the Contras. He testified he received a letter from then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> commending his efforts, and then a telephone call. The president mentioned that he did not understand the opposition of then-House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to Contra aid. <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> `` prays every day to defeat everything you believe in and you must fight him as an enemy and defeat him.'' He said that the North-Hunt meeting was in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 11, 1985 and that <PERSON> North </PERSON> flew there from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in a Channell-arranged airplane. At the end of the meeting <PERSON> North </PERSON> left, saying `` something like ` you all are going to talk about money and I ca n't take any money.'' During the congressional Iran-Contra hearings two years ago, <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified, `` I do not recall ever asking a single, solitary American citizen for money'' although `` I showed a lot of munitions lists.'' Hunt contributed $ 237,500 to the foundation and also made a $ 237,500 loan to it. In addition, <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> North </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> woman, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Garwood </PERSON>, about a need for small airplanes for the rebels. Later that day, she wrote out a check for $ 75,000 and wrote across the top that it was tax deductible, he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Garwood </PERSON> was at the airport after the North-Hunt meeting, he said. `` <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> talked about the need for more planes and she gave <ORGANIZATION> NEPL </ORGANIZATION> a check for $ 32,000 to buy a small plane.'' When <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s checks arrived, <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> said, he asked <PERSON> North </PERSON> to telephone his thanks. North called <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> at his home and it happened that the late <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, was a dinner guest. <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> commented that the director `` would now know what was going on.'' He also testified he arranged for a 10-15 minute meeting between a wealthy woman, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Newington </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Later that day, he said, <PERSON> North </PERSON> talked with her, and <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> told <PERSON> North </PERSON> he was going to ask her for a large grant. `` <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>?'' asked <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. `` You asked her for money!'' `` I told Colonel North I would try to ask her for over a million dollars,'' Channel replied. The woman made her contribution later, more than $ 1 million in stocks, <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>U.S. Holds Up Aid Pending Egyptian Economic Reforms</HEAD>

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is holding up $ 230 million in aid for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> because President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s government has failed to adopt acceptable economic reforms, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> denied that the aid was contingent on <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s agreeing with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> on an economic austerity package, but said it was important that the reforms adopted command broad international support, including that of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> denied a report in the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that quoted an unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official as saying, `` We're holding out at this point for an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` It's not because of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> agreement,'' said <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>. Egyptian sources said, however, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was tying its decision to <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> conditions, which they said may be applicable in general but would be very difficult to implement in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> because of the low incomes of many. The sources, who spoke to a reporter on condition they not be identified, noted recent rioting over <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> reforms in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and recalled that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> had food-price riots 12 years ago that forced President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> to roll back increases. At least 79 people were killed in the 1977 riots, with some estimates of the casualties going to 800 killed and injured. `` We agree with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> on the diagnosis and the prescription, but we differ on the amount of time to implement it,'' said one source. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, which already has increased prices on bread and other basic commodities five to ten times in recent years, would like to phase in the reforms over a few years, he said. `` Ideally we would like very much to implement the reforms at the same pace recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, but it's a question of practicality,'' he said, adding that the Egyptian government hoped `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, as an ally and friend, would be more sensitive to our political and social circumstances than a bank.'' `` We regard the relationship with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> as extremely important, both to us as well as to the interest of broader stability in the region,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. He said the aid, a portion of about $ 4.5 billion in economic and military assistance approved for the 1988 and 1989 fiscal years, was being held up because the legislation approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> made it contingent on `` the understanding that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> will undertake significant economic reforms which are additional to those which were undertaken in previous fiscal years.''

 The state <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimated Wednesday that $ 8 million in tourist dollars would be lost this week in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> because of the strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The state said it based its figures on an estimate that 10 percent of air tourists who had planned to visit <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> could not get there. Meanwhile, competing airlines increased flights, and cruise lines booked extra hotel rooms and delayed ship departures as the tourism industry made do. The shock for travelers was lessened somewhat by the diversity of airlines passing through <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, a brief lull in vacations before Easter weekend and the weeks of warning about the strike for travel agents and competing airlines. `` We really have n't felt it because there are so many airlines going in and out of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>,'' said travel agent <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. `` It could be a shaking out that could make things more efficient.'' Officials at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> are seeing daily adjustments as competitors take advantage of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s misfortune. Overall, the travel industry seemed to have adjusted to Eastern-less skies over <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. `` Continental has increased operations from 17 to 34 -LRB- flights daily -RRB-. ... I know <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> has expanded, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> has expanded positions here,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which operates <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> travel is largely unaffected because most islands are served by more than one carrier or can be reached through <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> connections, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> said. Eastern carried about 2 million passengers a year to 15 destinations in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. A total of 413 passengers had Eastern tickets Saturday coming off the 1,800-passenger <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. They were taken to a hotel while new arrangements were made. `` Some of them went to the pool and were enjoying the amenities of the hotel. They were in pretty good spirits,'' said <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevcik </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Kloster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Viking Line. `` Of course, getting off a seven-day cruise helps.'' But she said the strike altered the relationship between her company and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which had been one of the top three airlines carrying Norwegian cruise ship passengers in and out of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` Until all of their labor contracts are agreed upon, we would not even consider using them now,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sevcik </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` We'd cross that bridge when we came to it.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON>, an airline specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s competitors are making contingency plans but wo n't make long-term adjustments until <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s future is decided. Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, which relied on Eastern for up to 60 percent of its passengers, changed travel plans for 3,000 people, spent more than $ 50,000 on hotel rooms, had full crews working overnight on rebookings and were unable to accommodate only three people last weekend, said spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Steck </PERSON>. Norwegian's <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> left port 7 -LCB- hours late Saturday, but no one canceled, Ms. <PERSON> Sevcik </PERSON> said. `` It gets easier and easier,'' <PERSON> Steck </PERSON> said. `` We're buying space into the future to replace the Eastern space, but we have the luxury of time on our side.'' Carnival Cruise Lines, the industry leader, is `` putting all our passengers, obviously, on non-Eastern flights,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>. `` We got them all here last weekend, and we're confident we'll get them all here this weekend.'' Service to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is more difficult to adjust because of treaty agreements, but <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> is competitive in several markets that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> served, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has been one of the areas where Eastern has grown tremendously in the last two years,'' said company spokeswoman <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, estimating the airline carried 700,000 passengers last year.

 An election will be held May 16 to decide whether to build a $ 3 billion Denver airport, Mayor <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> announced Wednesday. `` We have heard from hundreds and hundreds of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> residents who have indicated support for the airport, but want to vote on it,'' the mayor said. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> and several council members had opposed holding an election. But this week, concerns mounted that a petition drive to force a referendum could push back the project's construction timetable and upset financing arrangements. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> said the vote's outcome would be considered binding on city government, even though the city is ready to break ground this summer on the airport, the nation's biggest such project in 15 years. He said the referendum would not delay groundbreaking. Completion of the airport is scheduled for 1993. The airport would be about 15 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and would replace <ORGANIZATION> Stapleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's busiest.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> announced on Wednesday that it will accept the authority of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in major human rights treaties, ending 40 years of resistance to the court's jurisdiction State Department officials hailed the move as a step toward an eventual agreement under which <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would join <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in accepting the court's rulings in all but the most sensitive political and national security cases. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> legal office released a letter from Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> de Cuellar withdrawing Soviet reservations to human rights treaties. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had signed the treaties but added the reservation that it did not accept <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> authority in disputes. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, formally known as the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, is the main judicial body of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. It has no powers of enforcement, but its rulings carry a major moral impact on world opinion. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would recognize the binding jurisdiction of the court in these human rights treaties: _ The 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genocide </ORGANIZATION>; _ The 1949 Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitutions of Others; _ The 1952 Convention on the <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>; _ The 1965 International Convention on the <ORGANIZATION> Elimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discrimination </ORGANIZATION>; _ The 1979 Convention on the <ORGANIZATION> Elimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>; _ The 1984 Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s letter suggested the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will agree to the court's authority in all human rights cases. He noted that Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in 1988 suggested before the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> that `` all states recognize the binding jurisdiction of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> with respect to the interpretation and application of human rights agreements.'' A senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted that Soviet legal writers previously said the Court is dominated by Western influences. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s letter `` may indicate their seriousness in accepting the court's jurisdiction in a greater range of cases,'' the official said. `` It is a major step.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been suggesting that the Soviets, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> join it in agreeing to accept the court's jurisdiction except in cases involving national security or the use of force That would avoid cases like <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s 1986 dispute with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, in which the Sandinista government contended the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was illegally mining its harbors and supporting the Contra rebels. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government refused to honor a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that sided with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Operators at the McGuire nuclear plant shut down one of the plant's two units after a small amount of radioactive gas leaked into the air from a steam generator tube. The company said Wednesday the leak never posed a threat to employees or the public. `` Things are well under control,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the plant. `` We're still under a state of alert purely as a conservative measure until the temperature -LRB- of the water inside the unit -RRB- can be cooled down.'' An alert, the second-least serious emergency classification, was declared at 11:45 p.m. Tuesday at the plant by <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> officials, who began shutting down Unit 1 a minute later. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> alerted state and local authorities at 12:01 a.m. The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said all safety systems functioned normally during the event. <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said the leak occurred at 11:37 p.m. Tuesday, apparently in one or more of the 4,600 tubes inside each of the four steam generators that are used to make electricity in the plant's two nuclear units. The leak contaminated an undetermined amount of water and allowed a small amount of radioactive gas to escape from an auxiliary building adjacent to the turbine building, he said. The gas leak lasted less than 10 minutes, <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said minute releases of radioactive materials occasionally occur at nuclear power plants and are strictly monitored by federal officials. The amount released Tuesday night was well within those guidelines, he said. <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said the leak was under investigation. The unit could be shut down for weeks as the expensive repairs are made, said <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON>. `` This will require cleaning up the secondary side where the contamination occurred,'' he said. `` We also will have to repair the tubes.'' The biggest job Wednesday afternoon was cleaning up the contaminated water, the spokesman said. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> said it was sending a team to investigate the incident.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation Wednesday to gradually raise the minimum wage $ 1.30 an hour to $ 4.65 after rejecting a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration plan for a smaller increase coupled with a reduced `` training wage.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he would veto legislation raising the minimum above $ 4.25 an hour and told <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders Wednesday that, in the words of press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, his proposal `` is fair and firm and his last offer.'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the labor committee chairman, said he was hopeful `` we can reach a compromise that is fairer to the working poor and that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will sign.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat, said the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could consider the measure next week. `` We're all set to go to the floor right away,'' he said. `` I think we'll have strong support.'' The minimum wage, now $ 3.35 an hour, has not been raised in eight years. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said he is `` glad to listen'' to Republican calls for a sub-minimum wage, but only if it is coupled with specific requirements for training and education. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> predicted a veto would be overridden. `` We're going to get this legislation achieved,'' he said. `` If it's the judgment that -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will -RRB- veto it, we'll override it,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> told reporters after the meeting. The committee approved the $ 1.30 increase on an 11-5 vote, with Republican Sens. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> voting with the panel's nine Democrats. The approval came after Democrats, joined by <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, rejected the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> proposal to raise the hourly minimum 30 cents each year for three years, to $ 4.25. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on labor standards has scheduled a Thursday meeting to draft legislation similar to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s bill. Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, plans to have the full panel consider the $ 4.65 an hour minimum wage, which he has said he strongly supports <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, long opposed by Democrats and organized labor, would establish a `` training wage'' of $ 3.35 an hour, the current minimum for all workers, and allow employers to pay newly hired workers at that rate for their first six months on the job. While opposition to the sub-miminum wage has softened, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said Wednesday that such a category would have to be sharply limited from what the administration wants. `` I'm not going to see the corruption of the minimum wage by using the words ` training wage' to throw older workers out of work and displace those who want to work 40 hours a week,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` I'm open to listening, to having the educational components outlined,'' he added. `` There was nothing in the administration proposal that had an educational component.'' He said such a plan would also have to be limited to first-time workers and be for a shorter duration than six months. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, while noting the administration's threatened veto, agreed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for an increase in the minimum wage had boosted chances that some increase will soon be approved. `` This administration has been more forthcoming than the previous eight years,'' the senator said. The committee approved three amendments to the bill <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> introduced. The first mirrors a provision in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan to raise the level at which small businesses are exempted from minimum wage provisions from gross annual sales of $ 362,000 to $ 500,000. Another proposal, also supported by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, would raise from 40 percent to 50 percent the so-called tip credit. Employers are allowed to count a certain percentage of tips toward the reported salaries of workers covered by the minimum wage. The committee also accepted a proposal to extend federal minimum wage standards to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>.

 Communist party leaders have ordered an evaluation of Stalinist crimes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and an analysis of the `` cult'' that surrounded <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s 1950s leader, <PERSON> Boleslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierut </PERSON>, the state news agency said Wednesday.

<TEXT>
 A magnetic wave spewed from the sun on Monday during a massive solar flare was detected Wednesday on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, but federal experts said it arrived as a `` minor storm'' that should have only small effects on communications. Forecaster <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said instruments detected a proton event, rapidly followed by a geomagnetic storm starting at about 12:30 p.m. EST. He said both events originated from the solar flare that occurred on the eastern edge of the sun on Monday. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said the radiation and geomagnetism from the flare were small, from the Earth's perspective, because of the angle of emission from the sun `` Had the flare been in the western half of the sun, it could have caused serious problems,'' he said. The sunspot region that spawned the flare, however, is moving farther west as the sun rotates and should be in a position by Monday to pose a greater radiation hazard to Earth if another eruption occurs, said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. `` If it blew up on us then, it could be quite exciting,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> experts said the sunspot region that produced the large flare continues to be active and that there is a 50 percent chance that another flare will occur before the region rotates out of view over the western limb, or horizon, of the sun. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said the proton event, which had been forecast for Tuesday, arrived at Earth later than expected because of the eastern location of the flare on the sun. Protons originating from flares are high energy particles that can damage electronics on satellites. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said the event detected Wednesday was too small to cause such problems. Warnings were sent, however, to power and telephone companies about the geomagnetic storm, he said. He said the storm, though classified as minor, could cause a slight electrical surge on long utility lines at high latitudes. Geomagnetic bursts also can trigger brilliant displays of the aurora, or polar lights, and <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> forecast, `` There should be increased activities at both poles.'' Monday's flare was classified as an X-15, the largest since April 1984. X-rays from the flare were so powerful that they overloaded instruments on <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> satellites that measure solar activity up to a level of X-12. A small flare, classed as an X-1, occurred Tuesday. Solar flares are eruptions that burst suddenly from the face of the sun, sending waves of electromagnetic radiation and charged particles out into space. A burst of X-rays, which crosses the nearly 93 million miles between <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and the sun in just eight minutes, was detected about 9:05 a.m. EST Monday. It disrupted a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loran </ORGANIZATION> navigation system and some short wave radio communications, officials said. Goddard Space Center officials said the Solar Max Satellite, monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, also detected the flare on Monday. No problems were reported on any of the 21 satellites monitored by <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON>. The sun goes through phases of intense activity. It passed a low point in 1986 and is now climbing toward an expected peak in intensity later this year or early in 1990.

 Rep. G.V. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss., proposed legislation Wednesday that would set a $ 1,000 fine and a one-year term in jail for anyone displaying the American flag on the floor or ground The proposal by <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, would expand a 1968 law providing penalties for publicly mutilating, defacing, defiling, burning or trampling the flag. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said he was angered by a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> art exhibit. `` Citizens throughout the country desire that the flag be treated with great respect,'' he said. `` It certainly does not belong on the floor.'' An exhibit at the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> consists of the flag, a wall display of pictures of flag-draped caskets, South Koreans burning the flag and a `` <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> go home'' sign; and a ledger for comments on a shelf below the photos. Veterans say the exhibit invites viewers to trample the flag as they go to the ledger.

<HEAD>Uranium Plant's Contamination Risk Disputed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four plant workers and two subcontractor employees at a uranium processing plant showed high levels of uranium contamination in urine samples last year, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> said. However, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> questioned the validity of the urine tests and asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to return its inspectors to the plant at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> yanked the inspectors from the plant last December after independent urine tests showed that they, too, had been contaminated by uranium. The plant 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> processes uranium for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which uses it elsewhere to make nuclear weapons. Pulling the inspectors, <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> said, needlessly alarmed some plant workers and prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and some companies which serve the facility to pull out their representatives. <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> received a letter Tuesday from <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reafsnyder </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> manager at the plant. It said the four plant workers and two subcontractor employees were the only ones who showed high levels of uranium contamination among 7,300 people who were tested at the plant. The letter said the six showed readings above 35 micrograms of uranium oxide dust per liter, a level considered a health hazard. Subsequent urine samples did not show unhealthful levels, <PERSON> Reafsnyder </PERSON> said. He also told <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> that 20 plant workers had test results showing uranium levels which were lower but still above safety levels. Those workers were reassigned to other areas. In his subsequent letter to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> said the agency's `` partial quarantine'' was an arbitrary decision and told <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> the ban should be lifted at once `` EPA has been cavalier in advising its own employees to stay away and leaving everyone else in a quandary,'' said <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said the agency is still reviewing results of tests on the two inspectors and plans to announce early next week whether it will allow its inspectors to return to the plant. The agency also has asked a new laboratory to conduct future tests. Meanwhile, The <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported that internal memos show that underground ponds of radioactive water have formed beneath three more buildings at the Fernald plant, posing a threat to water supplies as well as to the buildings. Westinghouse Materials of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which operates the plant for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said it has begun efforts to remedy the problems. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON> team manager for the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, said the information was no surprise. The underground pools could seep through the ground and contaminate drinking-water supplies for a wide area, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reafsnyder </PERSON> said that clay under the plant seems to have confined the contamination.

<HEAD>Arafat Lays Cornerstone For Palestinian Embassy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> laid the cornerstone of a Palestinian embassy in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> on Wednesday. President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> denounced the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman's new peaceful image, declaring that concessions never `` win back rights.'' <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s defense minister, said attempts by radical <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions to infiltrate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> were `` clear-cut terror'' despite remarks to the contrary attributed to Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. A senior <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> official said in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, the Israeli army should expect retaliation for attacks on Palestinians. He added, however, that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will continue the moderate position it has taken since <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism in December and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the only <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> country to make peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, begins a three-nation European tour Thursday focused on <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s role in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts and its economic aid to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was the first country to recognize the independent state declared in November by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which acts as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> legislature. <PERSON> Aafat </PERSON> said to Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, the first woman to lead a Moslem country: `` We know for freedom there is a very high price. As you have paid for your freedom, we will continue to pay for ours.'' More than 100 foreign diplomats and dignitaries attended the ceremony. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, did not mention <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> by name, but declared in a clear reference that `` the policy of free concessions never led anyone to win back his rights.'' `` Whatever such concessions produce they will never achieve anything because in the end <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> will say no,'' the president said. `` The policy of concessions is very far from our political and doctrinal thinking.'' He was addressing a rally for the 26th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s rise to power. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, an air force captain in 1963, became president in 1971. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> has opposed previous efforts by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and has feuded with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman since 1983. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is prepared to attend an international peace conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, he said, but accused <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders of `` deliberate intentions of perpetual aggression.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told reporters at an army base in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> the guerrillas who tried to enter <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> did so `` with the purpose to inflict damage, killing, maybe taking hostages.'' `` What we have experienced in the last few months is clear-cut terror,'' he said. `` If this is not terror, I do n't know what is terror.'' A senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official quoted <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> on Tuesday as concluding the attempted raids were not acts of terrorism requiring a break in American contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` We make a mistake if we define that too closely,'' he said of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s view about the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and terrorism. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> began a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s declaration in December <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> executive committee, said raids from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are aimed at military targets and do not violate the renunciation of terror. `` We did not mean that armed struggle is a form of terroris,'' he said in the Jordanian capital. `` The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> army, which is killing our children and raiding our camps, should expect retaliation.'' He added, however: `` We will not go back on our political position.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s tour begins in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and includes visits to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, he will attend a conference on atmospheric pollution and confer on the side with a major participant, President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Osama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Baz </LOCATION>, his chief political adviser, said <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> has `` two major aims: to benefit <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s development, economic reform and bilateral ties and to give a new push to peace efforts.''

<HEAD>New Orleans Symphony Resumes Concerts After One-Year Layoff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The New Orleans Symphony, silenced more than a year ago with a nearly $ 4 million debt, set the premiere of its new season Wednesday with a sold-out concert under the baton of conductor <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Shostakovich </PERSON>. `` Fanfare For A New Beginning,'' composed by orchestra member <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, will launch the program. Also set for the opening were a balloon drop, a party and fireworks. `` I think it's out of danger now,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who took over in December as president of the symphony board. `` We have a new emphasis on fund raising and marketing. The symphony has put together a premier organization. `` In a way, the closing of the symphony focused everyone's attention on the problem and made people determined to keep it from happening,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who is also president of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Coca-Cola Bottling The symphony suspended operations Jan. 16, 1988, almost $ 4 million in debt. The financial crisis had been building for years, blamed on mismanagement before a professional manager was hired in 1986. Despite desperate `` save the symphony'' fund drives, musicians walked out in 1985 and 1987 when they were n't paid, and drastic budget cuts led to dwindling public support. After the 1988 spring season was canceled, a new symphony organization took over. Donations of $ 225,000, earmarked for the symphony if it reopened, will pay off the remaining debts and leave the books in the black Thursday morning, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. The symphony's home, the ornate Orpheum Theater, was sold to eliminate $ 2.4 million of the debt. The buyers, whose names have not been made public, have agreed to let the symphony play rent free for the next five years. Lending encouragement to symphony officials was an unexpected surge in public support. Two-thirds of the season tickets for the 12-week spring program have been sold, although officials had considered a one-third sale a mark of success. It is the 53rd season for the symphony and the third as music director for <PERSON> Shostakovich </PERSON>, son of the late Russian composer <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Shostakovich </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 In a bittersweet tribute to the start of the Northeast Shuttle, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday made a desperate attempt to lure passengers back to the service they pioneered in 1961 by offering $ 12 one-way weekend fares and $ 49 one-way weekday fares. `` This is a move to generate revenue right now for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, vice president for marketing. `` We have to breathe the life of passenger revenues into that operation.'' The fares recall the $ 12 ticket offered in happier times 18 years ago when <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> introduced the original concept in commuter air travel between major cities in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>. The current fare is $ 99 one-way on weekdays and from $ 69 to $ 99 one-way on weekends. The company will run full-page newspaper ads, as well as radio spots, in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week in hopes of bringing customers home. <ORGANIZATION> Competitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it would not slash fares to match, and spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> reacted to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s play on its old fare: `` We've definitely got a 1989 product.'' She noted that most shuttle passengers are business travelers who are n't sensitive to fare changes. `` It is a businessman's market; it's a must-go market.'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> denied the action was aimed at protecting the pending $ 365 million sale of the shuttle service to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. He said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> wants to at least keep its 62 daily shuttle flights, which normally carry 6,500 to 8,000 passengers, operating during the Machinists strike, which began Saturday and nearly shut down the airline because pilots have honored picket lines. The public's confusion has resulted in some <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> shuttle flights this week with as few as six passengers. `` I can guarantee you we're not making money at $ 12, but I can tell you at no dollars we're making less,'' he said. The newspaper ads invite people to: `` Fly the original shuttle at the original price _ $ 12 one way. We're back.'' Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said shuttle passengers are not at risk of being stranded by a bankrupt airline because bankruptcy is still a last resort. Another spokesman, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has pulled television ads and canceled other promotions since the strike. Advance bookings are `` near zero,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, executive vice president. Besides its shuttle, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s only other service is a thrice-weekly roundtrip between <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. That route requires little promotion even in normal times because of limited competition.

<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> think tank on Wednesday urged the government to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and said that with adequate security arrangements, a Palestinian state would not pose a deadly threat to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The report set off a ruckus in the government. The right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have governed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in an uneasy coalition since elections in July 1984 and again in November 1988 ended in stalemates. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, said the study undermines <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s efforts to resist <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European pressures to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Achimeir </PERSON> said. But Finance Minister and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> called the study `` intelligent'' and said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must speak to <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Alpher </PERSON>, director of the 20-member team that produced the study and a separate paper of recommendations, said, `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> can set conditions on its agreement, but it is going to have to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to solve the problem under the present circumstances.'' The study by <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. In the peace proposal entitled `` Toward A Solution,'' the independent think tank proposed a lengthy period of autonomy for the 1.7 million Palestinian residents of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> as a precursor to possible statehood. `` We are talking about a 10 - to 15-year process that begins with a series of confidence-building measures and new concepts on the part of both parties,'' <PERSON> Alpher </PERSON> said The 24-page proposal conflicts with government policy ruling out talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and rejecting any possibility of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. The proposed transition period is considerably longer than the five-year interim period suggested by the 1978 Camp David Accords. <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> advocates an immediate turnover and predicted in a recent interview that a Palestinian state would emerge in two years. The center recommended <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should not commit itself to a Palestinian state in advance. But it urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> not rule out the possibility, noting that with proper security arrangements the concept of a Palestinian state was not a `` mortal danger'' to the Jewish state. To win Palestinian confidence, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would have to offer comprehensive self-rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, give up control over most state land in occupied zones and stop building Jewish settlements. Palestinians would have to cease violent acts and terrorism against Israeli targets and accept that Palestinian refugees would not be able to return to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In an interview, <PERSON> Alpher </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> also would have to agree to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> keeping some Arab land seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war and to limitations on the sovereignty of a new state, including <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s control of its airspace The 235-page study said 2.2 million of the world's 4.6 Palestinians live in <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states, half of them in teeming refugee camps. It says the sudden and unplanned movement of refugees to a new state posed a serious danger of economic collapse, social chaos and renewed guerrilla insurgency against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The center proposed that during an interim period <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states begin resettling the camp residents on their own territory and that only a portion of the refugees move to a new <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> state. The study says the sudden separation of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> would cause economic hardship for both sides, with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> losing workers and an export market while 100,000 Palestinians would lose their jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. An initial investment of up to $ 2.5 billion would be needed for building basic industry, electricity, roads and a port in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. About $ 2 billion would be needed annually for several years to prevent a drop in living standards, it said. The study says <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which receives about $ 3 billion annually in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid, would need additional funds. Up to $ 10 billion would be needed to resettle 20,000 Israeli settlers, withdraw <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops, relocate military facilities and erect an electronic border fence. The report's authors included an ex-director of military intelligence, a former head of the military government in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and a well-known conservative scholar.

<HEAD>Convention Leaves Open Rights of Unborn</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday approved a draft convention on the rights of children that leaves open the legal status of the unborn. A <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the wording of the convention, which is subject to approval by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, would weaken international laws against employing children in war-related activities. Approval by the 43-nation panel came without a vote after many speakers welcomed the draft but also listed reservations. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatka </PERSON>, who headed the negotiations on the project since they began in 1978, told the commission it was the `` product of compromises. He cited specifically the draft's definition of a child. Article 1 defines as a child everyone below age 18 unless legal adulthood is attained earlier under national law. Another article has signatories recognizing that `` every child has the inherent right to life.'' The preamble of the draft refers to a 1959 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> Declaration on the Rights of the Child `` before as well as after birth.'' <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> led the fight for including the preamble. But <PERSON> Lopatka </PERSON> said no consensus was possible on whether to include a reference to the unborn child in the convention's articles. He said negotiators faced `` principal divergence of views on this issue'' and decided to leave it open to national legislation. In daylong debate, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaeger </PERSON> said it was `` the first time that the rights of the unborn child are recognized in an international convention.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuomin </PERSON> said his government interpreted the definition of a child as `` not including a fetus before birth.'' Several speakers expressed concern at another key article which commits signatories to `` take all feasible measures to ensure that persons who have not attained the age of 15 do not take a direct part in hostilities.'' <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> were among those criticizing that this offers less protection than existing international norms, including an additional protocol to the Geneva Conventions which says that children under 15 `` must not be allowed'' to take part in hostilities. The observer of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, speaking last, said the draft's article `` even weakens international humanitarian law and introduces ambiguities.'' The draft's 54 articles include many basic human rights already laid down in other internationally binding accords. Specific provisions commit signatories to protect children against `` all forms of sexual exploitation'' and to prevent `` the abduction, sale of or trafficking in children.'' One article includes a reference to children's right to `` receive and impart information of all kinds ... through any media of the child's choice'' but adds that this right may be `` subject to certain restrictions.'' The West German delegate commented that `` a clarification taking into account parents' rights would have been urgently required because I am sure that no one in this room believes that children should be allowed to watch TV for unlimited hours.'' <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryce </PERSON> said that concern voiced by some parents that the accord may undermine their relationship with their children was unfounded. `` The convention makes abundantly clear the primary responsibility of parents for their children,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> will have to decide on funds needed for setting up a special committee that is to monitor implementation of the convention.

<HEAD>Meryl Streep, Apple Industry Trade Barbs Over Alar</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Actress Meryl Streep and the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> apple industry squared off in a bicoastal battle Wednesday over the movie star's talk show appearances warning against eating Alar-treated apples. Ms. <PERSON> Streep </PERSON> has little scientific knowledge about the chemical daminozide, sold under the name Alar, and should not go on television denouncing it, said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlect </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> fruit industry lobbyist based in <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>. The Academy Award-winning actress, a founder of the group <ORGANIZATION> Mothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Others </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pesticide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limits </ORGANIZATION>, has appeared on the `` Today'' and `` Donahue'' shows and other programs recently denouncing the use of Alar. `` She is not a Ph.D. from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Schlect </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horticultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` She is not knowledgeable about why -LRB- farmers -RRB- use products or what would happen if they were not -LRB- used -RRB-.'' Ms. <PERSON> Streep </PERSON> acknowledged her lack of scientific training in an interview Wednesday, but said that was not the issue. `` I'm not a scientist so I have to go with the best information available,'' Ms. <PERSON> Streep </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview from her agent's office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I eat them and I feed them -LRB- to her three children -RRB- so I am involved in the apple issue.'' `` I'm not interested in beating up on farmers. I'm interested in farmers being supported to grow in ways not threatening to health,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Streep </PERSON>, whose group is tied in with the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based non-profit consumer watchdog agency. Although the safety of Alar has been debated for years, the latest flareup began Feb. 26 when the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> news program `` 60 Minutes'' aired a story on a report by the <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> titled `` Intolerable Risk: Pesticides In Our Children's Food.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> released the report the next day, saying that 5,500 to 6,200 preschoolers were projected to get cancer sometime in their lives as a result of childhood exposure to six to eight chemicals used in fruits and vegetables. The report found the greatest risk from UDMH, a breakdown product of daminozide, also known as Alar. Preschoolers consume six times more fruit than the average adult, and the <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> estimated that the average preschooler's cancer risk from exposure to UDMH in their first six years was approximately one case for every 4,000 preschoolers exposed. That report touched off an uproar in the apple industry and also among some scientists and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, who said it was misleading and alarmist. Alar is not a pesticide. It is a chemical growth regulator that is sprayed on apple trees after they blossom. It works internally to improve the color and firmness of apples, mainly by keeping them on the tree longer. That extends shelf life and also gives growers a longer harvest time, which can be critical in times of labor shortage. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> proposed a ban on Alar earlier this decade, although it did not go through with that. However, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> announced earlier this year that it planned to take steps towards banning Alar by 1990 because of the results of preliminary cancer tests on rats. To combat the TV blitz by Ms. <PERSON> Streep </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a grower-financed group, announced Wednesday that it had spent $ 1 million on full-page ads that will appear Friday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> papers, as well as <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's unfortunate she's using the emotions she can evoke in consumers ... against products and making opinions not based on fact,'' commission spokeswoman <PERSON> Vicky </PERSON> <PERSON> Scharlau </PERSON> said of Ms. <PERSON> Streep </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is the nation's leading apple producer, growing about half of the nation's supermarket apples. Also Wednesday, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> said groups calling for an end to chemicals in farming are naive and `` a major national threat to security.'' Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON> of the New York-based group of 250 scientists said abandoning chemicals would leave the nation's food supply vulnerable to the whims of nature. `` Meryl Streep is not going to tell them -LRB- the public -RRB- the consequences of not using Alar,'' Ms. <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON> said, adding that nature is full of carcinogens and that Alar has not been proven to cause cancer. The earlier Alar controversy had prompted the apple industry to severely cut its use of Alar, fearing a consumer backlash. The <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has said only about 5 percent of the total apple acreage is treated with the chemical. Ms. <PERSON> Streep </PERSON> said the 5 percent figure may not be accurate. She noted that Consumer Reports magazine found Alar in 23 of 32 apple juice samples it tested last year, although all the producers contended they use Alar-free apples. <PERSON> Schlect </PERSON> argued that the Alar content in the apple juice samples was below the allowable federal limits and was left-over traces from past Alar use.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday recognized <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s most popular opposition party, ending a 12-year ban and allowing its participation in national elections set for May 1. Since it was founded in 1977, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was denied legal status by the government of Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, who was deposed by Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> in a Feb. 3 coup. `` We are euphoric,'' said the party's political secretary, <PERSON> Adalberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Mongelos </PERSON>. `` It's a step in the right direction.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is one of three parties in the opposition coalition National Accord, which has yet to decide whether it will participate in the May 1 elections. Members of the National Accord are urging the government to revoke an electoral statute that allows the party receiving the majority of votes to automatically be granted a two-thirds majority in the house of deputies and senate. The coalition also seeks equal representation on the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, whose nine members include six representatives of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and three members of two token opposition parties that have particpated in previous elections. The president of the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, is considered a likely presidential candidate to run against <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who named himself provisional president on Feb. 3 and is all but certain to be the candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

 A change in federal regulations is being proposed to allow swine from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to be imported in 1989 for research purposes, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The proposal would incorporate procedures in the current regulations so that the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> can import the Chinese hogs. Officials said the changes, or protocol, could be used later by other importers. Under the plan, the Chinese swine would have to undergo extensive quarantine at the department's animal import center in <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, to be sure the animals are free of disease, including foot-and-mouth disease, which is present in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Sandinista newspaper claimed Wednesday that U.S.-backed rebels based in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> are mobilizing for attacks across the border. It cited unidentified sources `` close to the rebel leadership'' in the Honduran capital <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it had no information other than the report in Barricada, the official newspaper of ruling leftist party. An estimated 11,000 of the rebels known as Contras, the bulk of the U.S.-supported force, are in Honduran camps in the border area with their families. In <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said Wednesday the rebel army should not be disbanded and its fighters repatriated to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> until the Sandinista government fulfills its promise of democratic reforms. That implied a longer period for dismantling the rebel force and greater linkage to reforms in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> than suggested by an agreement the presidents of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> signed Feb. 14. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to continue humanitarian aid to the Contras while they remain in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` An armed group devoid of humanitarian assistance and concentrated on our border is a great danger to the security of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>,'' he told a news conference. The rebels are in the border province of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION> in camps near <LOCATION> Yamales </LOCATION>, about 280 miles from <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. A $ 27 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian aid package runs out March 31. Some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have proposed linking more aid, which President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he will request, to the Central American summit agreement. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> halted military aid in February 1988. Central American presidents agreed at the February 13-14 summit in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to develop a plan for dismantling the Contra force and repatriating its members or relocating them, presumably outside the region. They called for international verification of the accord, which contains provisions for early elections and democratic reforms in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Busby </PERSON>, special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, met with <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> on Tuesday night and told them the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants the Contras to return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the foreign minister said. `` Repatriation would benefit the Contras,'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said. `` It would benefit <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> because it could achieve democracy as the condition for repatration. And <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> would n't have any more armed groups or Nicaraguan refugees in its territory. So everyone wins.'' <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> said Tuesday the Contras were moving deeper into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to avoid detection by international observers, who have not yet been deployed. Contra leaders in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> denied the report. On Wednesday, the paper said 6,000 Contras commanded by former Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> had moved out of the jungle camps to strategic points on the border. It said they were preparing for `` offensive actions'' against Nicaraguan targets, not demobilization. The Contras have not agreed to the summit demobilization plan. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> said during the summit that some rebels might return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and continue the war even without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid. The Contras and <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> signed a temporary cease-fire a year ago and comparatively little fighting has been reported since.

 <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said Wednesday he would `` readily reverse'' his decision to forfeit nearly $ 300,000 in severance pay if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> determine the money would raise no ethical concerns. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee is looking into the matter with the White House after members expressed concern that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> was making an undue sacrifice by his decison not to take the payment to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. `` I would readily reverse that decision because, as some of them put it, I'm not a wealthy man,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` Certainly that's a benefit that's accrued over 13 -LCB- years that I would certainly love to be able to enjoy, especially at this particular time in this town.'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, whose annual salary dropped from $ 172,000 last year to $ 89,500 in the new job. But <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said he would not reverse his decision until the after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> completes its review. The severance pay was earned under <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, which he founded. Upon his confirmation to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Cabinet last week, he stepped down as the school's president and took an unpaid leave of absence as a professor of medicine. He had asked permission to take a paid sabbatical while at <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> determined the school's policy on paid leave did not meet government ethical standards. The Office of Government Ethics found no ethics problems with the severance payment, but <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> decided to give up the money before the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> position was formalized. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said his decision was in reaction to news reports at the time that were raising questions about his request for a paid leave. Last week at <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s confirmation hearing, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said the sacrifice was unnecessary, unfair and could discourage others from taking government jobs.

<HEAD>Dubcek Speaks Out Against Treatment of Dissidents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, the former Communist leader of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, attacked his country's recent jailing of dissidents and said no reform in <LOCATION> Czechoslvakia </LOCATION> is possible unless the events of 1968 are reviewed. As Communist Party chief, <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> led the liberal reforms known as `` the Prague Spring'' which were crushed by a Soviet-led invasion in August 1968. In an interview broadcast Tuesday night, <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was quoted as telling the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> radio: `` It is impossible to start out on a new road unless you have looked at everything behind you. `` This refusal to look the truth about 1968 in the eye is preventing the party and maybe the leadership ... from recognizing that it is not possible to move forward with perestroika -LRB- restructuring of society and the economy -RRB- until you fill in the blank spots of history.'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was interviewed on Feb. 24 in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. A transcript of his remarks was made available Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He was also quoted as criticizing the jailing of playwright and human rights activist <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and others after anti-government protests were put down by police in the Czechoslovak capital in January. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> called the unrest a `` surface phenomenon'' caused by `` the burden of the last 20 years,'' according to the transcript. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was given a nine-month sentence on Feb. 21. Seven other dissidents were tried that week. One was sentenced to a year in prison, one to nine months, and five received suspended sentences and fines. All seven were charged with hooliganism after they tried to lay flowers in memory of <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>, a Czechoslovak student who burned himself to death in 1969 to protest the 1968 invasion and the death of reform in his homeland. `` There is a serious issue here and that is that this legal system here does not adhere to the democratic rules of the game or to the democratic rules of law,'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> reportedly said. On Thursday, cultural activists <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jirous </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Tichy </PERSON> face a court in the Moravian town of <LOCATION> Jihlava </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> on charges of anti-state activity that could jail them for up to five years. <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, the current <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, and other prominent members of the Czechoslovak leadership continue to say the 1968 invasion was justified because <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s reforms threatened the socialist system. The refusal to re-evaluate was reiterated in an interview published last month in the Soviet weekly <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News with <PERSON> Zdenek </PERSON> <PERSON> Horeni </PERSON>, editor of the Czechoslovak party newspaper Rude Pravo. <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> editor <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> had asked pointedly whether the time had come to re-evaluate the events of 1968. `` Those events are over and done with. We will not return to their reappraisal _ at any rate our generation,'' <PERSON> Horeni </PERSON> replied. `` There is no inner need for this.'' Indications have grown in Soviet news media of some impatience in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s refusal to introduce more reform and with its handling of the unprecedented week of anti-government protests in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> in January.

 Rebels fighting the Marxist government of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> are still getting aid from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Wednesday. But <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said she did n't know the source of the money or how much was being sent. `` We've done our best to publicize our views in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and we've told the South Africans of our concern,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Affairs African subcommittee. The <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, known by its Portuguese acronym of RENAM0, has been fighting the government for 12 years, starting shortly after the nation won independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. Thousands of Portuguese colonists fled <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> to neighboring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and many support RENAMO. The <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> news agency AIM says 600,000 people, most of them children, have died as a result of the fighting. Refugees estimated at 800,000 to 1 million have fled to <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> are among the world's poorest countries. The average citizen earns about $ 150 a year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaycox </PERSON>, the bank's vice president for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, listed both among the African countries where incomes are beginning to improve after a decade or more of decline. At a news conference Wednesday, he singled out <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> for what he called a tremendous performance despite the burden of caring for the refugees. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where the average annual income reached $ 1,890 in 1987, is among the most prosperous African countries. In 1984, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed that South African aid to the rebels would cease and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> would expel guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who attack <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` We support the accord,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> government has charged <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> with violating the agreement. Last month, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials welcomed a call by South African Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to mediate the fighting. <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanpher </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s top official for southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said he wanted to find out if <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s proposal included <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said he envisioned negotiations like those of last year on southwest <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

Despite heavy rain, 2,500 Norwegian women marched in downtown <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> Wednesday night. They carried signs calling for six-hour work days and a minimum annual wage for women of $ 19,500. Activists complained that wage differences between men and women have increased during the 1980s, despite a Norwegian equal rights law. They also defended laws allowing women to choose abortion and lesbians' efforts to come out of the closet, <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Kristiansand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, pro-abortionists were met outside the city cathedral by counter-demonstrators carrying a crucified doll and banners saying: `` Yes to <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, No to Abortion.''

<HEAD>Gregg Says Sununu Not To Blame For State's Cash Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMA LOVE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An unpredictable economy, not the stewardship of former Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> is responsible for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s cash crisis, Gov. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` I was left with a very strong state, an extremely positive fiscal situation,'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> commented in response to reports that <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, now White House chief of staff, left <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> with the same financial problems for which <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> denounced <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> during the presidential campaign. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> forecast a $ 10 million budget surplus in his departing speech to the Legislature in January. Five days later <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> warned of a potential $ 13 million deficit when he cut most state spending 3 percent. The sudden turnaround prompted Democrats to accuse <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of masking a deficit to make himself look good and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> bad. The potential deficit was based on revenue projections that are still in debate. Also, the Legislature under-funded several programs last spring when it wrote a supplemental budget for 1989. Legislative leadership said then that better revenue and cost estimates would be available in January to use in adjusting the estimated $ 571 million general fund budget. A supplemental spending bill to ensure the state ends the year in the black is still under consideration. When it appeared agencies were spending more than legislators estimated out of their 1988 budgets, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> privately twisted arms last spring to produce $ 24 million in lapses, appropriated but unspent funds. That left the state with a $ 13 million surplus last July 1. Usually criticized for being overly cautious in his revenue estimates, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> says early receipts made him feel confident the state would take in more revenues than estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in April. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s January estimate also was lower than <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s estimate of how much agencies would return to the treasury on June 30 also was higher than <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s. When <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> announced the turnaround, he deducted for under-funded programs and used revenue and lapse estimates that were $ 13 million less than those projected by <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said in an interview last month that <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> `` still could have been optimistic into December'' that his estimates were correct `` and if I were a departing governor, I suspect I would have been.'' A key element in the equation are the lapses. In his six years in office, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s taskmaster style of management produced the results he sought. In an interview last week, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said he felt `` we still would have been able to manage it'' and that based on revenue estimates when he left, a small surplus would have been left even after those bills he felt had to be paid were deducted. Though he warned aggressive management would be required to ensure any of the $ 10 million was left on June 30, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> did n't mention the debts when he talked about a surplus Critics say that painted too rosy a picture, but <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> says they were n't listening closely. `` For folks to say I did n't say revenues were tight is just not true,'' he says. `` I was the one who said it was going to be a tough, tough biennium.'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> reiterated Wednesday that <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> was n't to blame. `` I do n't point the finger of blame at anyone,'' he said. `` I think we are caught in a situation where revenues are falling. It was an unpredictable situation. I do n't think it was poor management.'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> praised fellow Republican <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s Republican-controlled Legislature for prudent use of state funds during <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s three terms as governor `` We had very good stewardship over the last six years,'' he said. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s criticism of <LOCATION> Masschusetts </LOCATION> was justified. While <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> spent supluses on one-time projects, such as the land conservation program, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent large sums on new programs that have to be funded or cut in lean times, he said. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> predicted the universal health care program enacted by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> `` is going to bankrupt that state in my opinion.''

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Parental Leave Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee gave party-line approval Wednesday to legislation that would require large employers to provide up to 10 weeks of unpaid leave for parents to take care of newborn or seriously ill children. The bill, a major part of congressional Democrats' domestic agenda, also would require companies with 50 or more employees to grant similar leave to workers who need extended time off to take care of ailing parents. And it would require them to give up to 15 weeks of unpaid leave for the workers' own serious illness. In each instance, the only direct cost to the employer would be to continue whatever company-paid health benefits were in force at the time the worker requested leave. However, many private and public employers, including the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION>, oppose the measure on grounds it would be overly disruptive to their operations to hold jobs open for workers requesting such extended leaves even though the direct financial cost might be minimal. The measure cleared the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on a 23-12 vote at the end of a daylong meeting in which the panel beat back about two dozen Republican-sponsored amendments. The bill is expected to be scheduled for floor debate in May after facing review by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Only two major amendments were adopted Wednesday _ one to include congressional offices and another to exempt public elementary and secondary schools from some of the measure's provisions. The amendment applying to public schools was sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Marge </PERSON> <PERSON> Roukema </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, who offered it at the urging of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. She read panel members a letter from the association in which it agreed to drop its opposition to the overall bill if the amendment it sought was adopted. Arguing that whatever was fair for public schools was fair for private schools, Rep. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, attempted to amend Ms. <PERSON> Roukema </PERSON>'s amendment to spell that out. He was defeated, 25-10. Later, <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> attempted to have the bill spell out that the same special considerations that public schools could apply to teachers on leave _ mainly special leeway in offering them equivalent work, rather than the same work _ would extend to police and fire departments and public health agencies. Again, he was defeated, 25-10.

<TEXT>
 The justice minister appealed to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday for a system of checks and balances to be enshrined in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s new constitution and repeatedly cited the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution as an example. In presenting the main principles of the new constitution, Justice Minister <PERSON> Kalman </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulcsar </PERSON> said the drafters of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution faced many of the same pitfalls <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> confronts today. The constitution, which would mark a significant break from the current 1949 constitution modeled after the Soviet one, is to guarantee civil and human rights and the existence of various parties. Parliament, which began its session Wednesday, also was told by Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> that the government will consider calling a referendum on its highly controversial <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> power project. It was the first indication <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> might consider withdrawing from the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros project, which it is building jointly with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and with Austrian financial backing. Environmentalists in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> argue that the project will cause irreparable damage to the river. A new law on referendums is due in June. It is part of a package of political reforms designed to complement the new constitution, which is to be adopted by referendum early next year.

 A high-speed rail link from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to the Channel Tunnel will be built underground and through deep surface cuttings for two-thirds of its way because of environmental protests, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday. The state network bowed to a furious campaign by residents in southeast <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and picturesque <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION>, who said demolition along the 68-mile route and the noise of trains would devastate their lives. The changes will increase the cost of the rail link project from $ 2 billion to $ 2.9 billion, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> said. The route wo n't be ready until the late 1990s, so existing railway tracks and lower speeds on the <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> side will have to be used when the Channel Tunnel now being built to link <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> opens in 1993.

 An <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> storm packing gusts of up to 60 mph gnawed at portions of the <ORGANIZATION> Outer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday as cold, wet weather covered most of the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seaboard </LOCATION>. Cold temperature records were broken or tied in at least eight cities in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>. Snow fell over southeast <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and freezing rain spread ice over southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to northeastern <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Snow also extended along the western portion of <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> and northeast <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, and from western <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> across western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> panhandle. Rain reached from the northern half of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> into southwest <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, where the eastern storm hit hardest, the end of a motel toppled into the surf and about 40 cottages were damaged on the <LOCATION> Outer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Banks </LOCATION>, where beachfront residents were urged to move into emergency shelters Wednesday night. A layer of ice covered much of the state, making roads so slick that salt trucks were stopped in their tracks. `` This has the makings of being another Ash Wednesday storm, which was the most severe storm on record for the Outer Banks,'' said <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Piland </PERSON> of Dare County Emergency Management. The Ash Wednesday storm hit in March 1962. At least three fatalities were blamed on ice-covered interstate highways in the eastern part of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, and water sloshed over sections of state route 12, the main route along the Outer Banks. Winter weather warnings were in effect for much of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, portions of eastern <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and southeastern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.

Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 11 degrees at <LOCATION> Limestone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, to 86 at <LOCATION> Gila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. The national weather forecast for Thursday called for rain along the central <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast and from the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> coast across east-central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Rain, with snow in higher elevations, will extend from the northern two-thirds of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> across the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> and northern plateau.

But organizers of her five-day test run in the self-contained environment believe it could lead to the stars. `` I feel like a pioneer in here,'' Ms. <PERSON> Alling </PERSON> said in a videotaped hookup with reporters in a nearby conference room. `` It is another world, and a world apart from where you are. It is a remarkable feat.'' Her experiment will be the longest test so far of the airlock, a human-inhabited module independent of the air, water and nutrients of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The experiment is the first major test of plans for the much bigger Biosphere II, the largest closed ecosystem ever attempted. Eight `` biospherians'' intend to enter that structure in 1990 for a two-year stay. If the $ 30 million project succeeds, <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biospheres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ventures </ORGANIZATION> plans to sell versions to governments and researchers to preserve endangered species or for research or space colonization, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyhr </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Alling </PERSON>'s abbreviated module, stocked with flora and fauna, is a steel-framed greenhouse with a 20-foot ceiling over a 23-by-23-foot base. Its 15,000 cubic feet would be about the size of a two-story, two-room house. Biosphere II, by contrast, will have 5 million cubic feet under glass, or about 2 -LCB- acres. Lack of room forced planners to omit chicken, fish and goats from the test, and Ms. <PERSON> Alling </PERSON> will not be able to eat the full array of fruits and vegetables of the larger experiment. But Ms. <PERSON> Dyhr </PERSON> said she would take in 2,500 calories a day from 29 plant species, including potatoes, beans, carrots, strawberries and papayas. Other members of the animal kingdom in the five-day test are snails, insects and two fish. Air circulation works on a system similar to Biosphere II's: Hot air will rise over the desert section of the module, pick up moisture, then fall as rain. Solar fans and a turbine will send air back over the desert to begin the cycle again. Plants will exchange oxygen for the carbon dioxide given off by humans. Ms. <PERSON> Alling </PERSON>, a 29-year-old marine-mammal scientist with a master's degree from <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, is a coordinator for Biosphere II She will monitor systems inside while project managers outside do the same, as well as record Ms. <PERSON> Alling </PERSON>'s heart and respiration rate and other vital signs. Her living quarters will be kept private through use of blinds will consist of an efficiency kitchen, bathroom with shower, bed and a desk in a study area. Ms. <PERSON> Alling </PERSON> said she would be on a tight schedule each day, rising at 7 a.m. to harvest and cook her food, then doing computer work on Biosphere II, which will feature a 35-foot-deep ocean as one of its seven separate environmental systems. She will be in touch with the outside through a telephone and computer electronic mail, and the study has books and a videocassette recorder. `` I'll even be able to watch Saturday night movies,'' Ms. <PERSON> Alling </PERSON> said. She said that during preparation, she had learned to enjoy the enclosed environment. `` It has the wonderful smell of a rich tropical rain forest,'' Ms. <PERSON> Alling </PERSON> said. Eight `` biospherians'' are scheduled to enter Biosphere II in 1990 for a two-year stay. The aim of Biosphere II is to see if humans can exist in a self-regulating world with its own climate. It has desert, ocean, farmed land, marsh, savanna, jungle and human habitats in a six-story building resembling a mosque. `` Basically it's an experiment to test the systems in terms of maintaining the environment, the atmosphere particularly,'' said <PERSON> Dyhr </PERSON>. There have been 2 -LCB- years of unmanned studies in the test module, and there was a three-day manned study.

 Mayor-elect <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> promised Wednesday to continue pushing the agenda of retiring socialist Mayor <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, though perhaps with a lower voice. <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON>, the city's director of economic development, won election Tuesday under the banner of <ORGANIZATION> Sanders </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, defeating a Democratic rival by a 53-to-42 percent margin. `` I think what the people of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> have said yesterday is that we've had Progressive government for the past eight years, and it's been good government,'' <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> said at a news conference. While eschewing the socialist label that made <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> something of a celebrity, <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> said in an interview that he favors such leftist goals as workplace democracy and a shift from military to social spending. `` Those who have the money and those who have the power tend to represent themselves pretty well,'' <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> said, adding that he sees the job of mayor as being the one who `` tips the scales just a little bit'' toward those without money and power. <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> showed surprising strength in traditionally Democratic and Republican wards in his victory over Democrat <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chioffi </PERSON>. He received 5,626 votes to her 4,400 votes. Two minor party candidates split a few hundred other votes. <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON>, 39, is the grandson of French-Canadians who came south to work in the woolen mills of neighboring <LOCATION> Winooski </LOCATION>. He said he gets his politics from his working-class background, not from Marxist theory. His term begins April 1. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, 47, who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1986 and for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year, announced in December that he would leave politics to teach and write. He does n't rule out another try for elective office. He was first elected mayor in 1981 and won three subsequent two-year terms. He is the only avowed socialist mayor in the nation.

 Two British soldiers were killed and six others injured when a guerrilla land mine exploded under their jeeps Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, police reported No group immediately claimed responsibility, but suspicion fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, fighting British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a police spokesman in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, said the soldiers were in a patrol traveling north out of the city in two armored Land Rover jeeps shortly before midnight when a massive land mine exploded. He said the second of the two jeeps took the main force of the blast. Security forces sealed off the area after the blast. No other details were immediately available. The mainly Roman Catholic <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> wants to unite the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the 95 percent <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> under socialist rule. Earlier Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying two elderly men killed a day earlier in a triple murder at a gas station were slain by mistake. It said the targets were three Protestants allegedly questioned by police about recent attacks on Roman Catholics. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> plans a bombing blitz in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> using large quantities of explosives and arms supplied by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>'s warning followed discovery of an arms and explosives cache at <LOCATION> Scarborough </LOCATION>, northeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, that caused speculation the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> will try to kill Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> during a <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference there March 17-18. Party leaders confirmed Wednesday the meeting of the party's national council would be held as planned at the <ORGANIZATION> Spa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Scarborough </LOCATION> Government sources said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and other Cabinet ministers were determined to defy the threat. An <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb attack Oct. 12, 1984, at the annual Conservative convention in the south coast resort of <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> killed five people, but Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was not hurt. While answering questions in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said: `` The Provisional <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> have a substantial amount of arms and explosives which they got from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. `` These arms and explosives are concealed. They are being found quite regularly in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, north and south. Now they are being found in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and north <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION>.'' He said it was too early to tell if the arms were linked to an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb factory police discovered Dec. 21 in <LOCATION> Clapham </LOCATION>, south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> secretary, said: `` The intention of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is to kill, maim and murder wherever they find easy targets and where carnage can be created.'' He cited the latest discovery in proposing the annual renewal of tough anti-terrorism measures for <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The vote to renew was 239-118. In its statement about Tuesday's killings in <LOCATION> Coagh </LOCATION> village, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said violin-maker <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, 62, and pensioner <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON>, 72, were shot down in the `` general confusion.'' It said they had no paramilitary connections. The third man killed, station owner <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dallas </PERSON>, was in the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, an outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> paramilitary group, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>China Says VD Cases Quadrupling Every Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of venereal disease cases in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has quadrupled annually in recent years because of increased prostitution, sexual freedom and contacts with the outside world, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official news agency said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the problem is particularly serious because the sexually transmitted diseases were practically non-existent in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for decades, and few doctors know how to diagnose or treat them. The report did not give any nationwide figures, but it said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> statistics showed an average 312 percent annual growth in VD cases in recent years. It did not say how many years. It said <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most open city because of its proximity to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, recorded 10,000 VD cases between 1984 and September last year. The semi-official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that a 1-day-old boy in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> recently was found to have been born with gonorrhea contracted from his father. It said he was the ninth child in the city confirmed to be suffering from VD. According to statistics from venereal disease centers in 16 cities, 70.5 percent of sufferers are male. About 77 percent are gonorrhea cases, while 16.77 percent are syphilis. The return of VD was attributed to greater sexual freedom that has broken barriers against premarital sex, more contacts with the outside world and the `` rampancy of prostitution'' in some areas. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted the daily <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> as saying some women are becoming prostitutes simply to make money, while others are forced into prostitution by gangs and some are frustrated in love and ignorant about sex. Before the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> takeover in 1949, an estimated 10 million people in in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had VD, 500,000 in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> alone. But the Communist government eradicated prostitution in the early 1950s, and in the early 1960s it claimed that VD no longer existed in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said that because <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was VD-free for so long, chapters on the diseases were left out off medical books and doctors are not able to recognize or treat them. Fake medicine dealers and charlatans are exploiting some people afraid to go to hospitals with their problems, it said. In the past few years, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has set up 192 treatment and prevention agencies throughout the country and established a national center in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>.

 A 4-year-old boy playing with a heater accidentally set a fire Wednesday that engulfed a wood frame house and triggered an explosion that killed one firefighter and critically burned two others, officials said. Authorities said the `` flash over'' _ a detonation of gases produced by combustion _ pushed the temperature in the house to over 1,000 degrees, melting the clothes and protective gear off the three firefighters. Firefighter <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>, 23, a four-year veteran whose brother helped fight the same fire, was the first <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> firefighter to die while fighting a fire since 1950, Fire Chief <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bennie </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zellner </PERSON>, 44, and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayers </PERSON>, 46, were hospitalized in critical condition with second - and third-degree burns covering 70 percent to 90 percent of their bodies, officials said Two other firefighters sustained minor injuries. `` The heat was so bad it disintegrated everything they were wearing,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> burn center, who estimated their exposure at 1,000 degrees. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the temperature was probably even higher. `` These guys are young, healthy men, and we expect that their vital organs will give us a good fight and keep going,'' <PERSON> Silverstein </PERSON> said. `` Physiologically they stand the best chances of anybody of surviving.'' The fire in a frame house in southwest <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was started in a closet by a child who was playing with wood in an open-faced heater, fire officials said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the child's mother tried to put the fire out with water before going to neighbors' homes to call the fire department. The fire chief said the three firefighters were wearing full protective gear, but that the explosive intensity of the fire was too hot for it to prevent the burns. `` There is nothing on the market that would have protected them under those conditions,'' he said. Officials said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and state flags at all the fire stations were lowered to half-staff Wednesday in honor of <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said funeral services have not been scheduled for <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>, who is survived by his wife <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>, who is expecting their first child.

 Declaring that she must `` do everything right from here on in,'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> prepared to leave here late Wednesday afternoon in her quest for a fourth consecutive victory in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. Butcher reached <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, 407 miles into the race, at 8:17 a.m. Wednesday, about 15 -LCB- hours after <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nenana </LOCATION> became the first musher to arrive in the <LOCATION> Kuskokwim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> community. Butcher was followed by four-time Iditarod winner <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> in the No. 3 position at 10:05 a.m. <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonrowe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buser </PERSON> completed the top five, arriving in <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> at 10:11 a.m. and 11:03 a.m., respectively Another 10 mushers in the field of 45 pulled into <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> by late afternoon. <PERSON> Runyan </PERSON> said he would stay in the village for the 24-hour layover required in the course of the 1,168-mile race from <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>. Completing the layover meant <PERSON> Runyan </PERSON> was unable to leave <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> before 4:43 p.m. Wednesday. Twelve of the mushers still in the race Wednesday had not taken their layovers. Many, including Butcher, completed them at <PERSON> Rohn </PERSON>. Butcher said the number of teams leading among the 45 still in the race had n't thinned as much as she expected. She also said she believed the frantic pace <PERSON> Runyan </PERSON> set had sapped his dogs. `` It took him 15 hours to cross the -LRB- Farewell -RRB- Burn,'' she said. `` It took me only 10.'' Forty-nine mushers left the Iditarod starting line Saturday in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. Three dropped out relatively early in the race and a fourth, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Aisenbrey </PERSON>, added his name to the scratch list Wednesday. Officials at the Iditarod headquarters in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> said they did not know the reason for <PERSON> Aisenbrey </PERSON>'s withdrawal. The annual Iditarod began 17 years ago and was inspired by a 1925 relay of serum to <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> during a diphtheria outbreak. The race, which carries a $ 250,000 purse, is put on largely by volunteers. Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> has been among them, but he said Wednesday that he no longer has the time to offer his services. Nonetheless, he made it to <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON>, the checkpoint before <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, to see some of the activity. `` A lot of the mushers are pretty good friends of mine from way back,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. `` I love this race and I'd do anything I can to promote it.'' The governor said musher and Iditarod founder <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Redington </PERSON>, No. 14 in the rankings Wednesday afternoon, has offered to provide him with a dog team if he wants to compete some year. `` That may be a little ways down the trail, as they say,'' said <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>, who is serving his first term. `` It probably wo n't work until I leave my present employment.''

 Security forces dragged Tibetans from their houses Wednesday as thousands of Chinese troops took up posts around <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> after three days of anti-Chinese riots, travelers said. By official count, 12 people had been killed and more than 100 wounded in violence since Sunday when Tibetans marched in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, demanding an end to nearly four decades of communist rule and the return of their spiritual leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>. Travelers quoted Tibetans as saying the actual death toll was much higher. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s government-in-exile in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> offered to hold talks with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to discuss the future of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. The Chinese Embassy in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> refused comment. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Thursday accused Tibetan separatists living abroad of smuggling weapons into <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and instigating riots in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, the Tibetan capital. In a commentary, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> also defended <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s human rights record in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, saying it is those opposed to Chinese rule who trample on the rights of the Tibetan people. Foreign witnesses to this week's rioting said they saw no Tibetans with weapons. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also announced further martial law orders: all foreigners must report to police; Tibetans harboring criminals must turn them in, and <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> will continue to suppress and root out separatists. No reports surfaced of further demonstrations or gunfire on Wednesday and early Thursday, but Westerners in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> said troops filled the streets. Beginning at midnight Tuesday, trucks with loudspeakers drove through the city of 70,000 announcing martial law was in effect and ordering Tibetans to stay inside, said foreign travelers, most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity. The foreigners gave the following account: Dozens of trucks packed with soldiers entered the city and troops _ some drinking beer _ set up checkpoints 15 miles outside <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> and at nearly every block in the city. Soldiers stopped all but official vehicles and arrested Tibetans in the streets. `` They were just collaring people ... and stuffing them into jeeps,'' said an American. Tibetans screamed with fright as Chinese troops pulled them from their homes. `` These were women's voices,'' said an Australian. `` The truck kept coming back. They would pick up a couple people, drive off with a half-dozen militia holding them down, then come back.'' It was not known who the people were, why they were picked up or how widespread the roundups were because the foreigners were confined to their hotels. But foreigners contacted at several hotels said they saw police raiding the homes of ordinary Tibetans along the streets in front of their hotels. Mobs led by Tibetan youths ransacked Chinese shops in three days of rioting through Tuesday, and a European traveler said not one Chinese-owned shop in the old quarter of the city escaped damage. The estimated 150 foreigners in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> have been ordered to leave the city by noon Thursday, but they were forbidden Wednesday to leave their hotels to buy tickets. Tourists said they were given a choice of going to <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> by bus, going to other cities in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> or flying to <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>. One traveler said soldiers stopped her and five others from catching a chartered bus for <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. Officials later told her they had arranged another bus to the border but wanted $ 4,185, three times the previous price, she said. `` They can shoot people and arrest people, but getting you a ticket and helping you change money is beyond their capacity,'' said one American. The travelers spoke in telephone interviews from <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, the capital of neighboring <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province and one of the few points of entry to the remote Himalayan region. Police detained two British reporters overnight. <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> of the Guardian newspaper said he and a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> news agency were released Wednesday after being questioned, with authorities most concerned about photographs. One Swiss who refused to turn over his film Sunday said police beat him and pointed a gun at his head. He said the police still had his camera and passport and would n't return them until he hands over the film and pays a fine. He said he was not injured. Three Swedes and an American who also took pictures were given back their cameras and passports after they paid fines. The imposition of martial law marked the first time Chinese authorities had taken the step anywhere since the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. Authorities apparently took the measure to prevent demonstrations on Friday, anniversary of the failed uprising that led the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> to flee to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in 1959. The violence that began Sunday was the fourth clash in 18 months between <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> security forces and Tibetans.

 The organizers of a college basketball tournament stand to lose up to $ 50,000 this week because a measles outbreak has forced them to hold the games in an empty 15,000-seat arena. Officials at the host <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> have juggled schedules, canceled events and asked fans to donate the cost of their unused tickets. But despite their efforts, the event's winners _ who must bear the greatest share of the loss _ could be financial losers. `` If I was to put ink to paper right now, I'd estimate those losses are going to be $ 30,000 to $ 50,000,'' <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said Wednesday. The tournament, to pick the winner of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, is scheduled to start Thursday and end Sunday. A <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> basketball player's case of measles and an outbreak of the highly contagious disease on the campus of <ORGANIZATION> Siena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, another <ORGANIZATION> NAC </ORGANIZATION> member, prompted the spectator ban. <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, as host, is fronting the money for the tournament. Any losses will be reimbursed from proceeds the winning team receives from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The winner receives an automatic bid to the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> tournament worth just more than $ 250,000 this year, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. The first priority in distributing the $ 250,000 is administrative. The winning team gets 50 percent of the balance, and the remaining 50 percent is shared by the other nine member schools. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said organizers would have a better estimate of losses once they know how many of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>'s 2,000 season ticket-holders ask for refunds on their $ 18 tournament tickets. `` We've had people who have donated their tickets or their money,'' he said. `` We've had others that ask for refunds.'' Meanwhile, tournament organizers have done their best to see that no one else gets the measles. Players will be met by a tournament delegate at their hotel and led through a service entrance into the Civic Center, where the games will be played, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. Reporters covering the tournament will be asked to prove they've been immunized against the disease; if not, they'll receive vaccinations on the spot For fans, it will be a bleak three days, with just one bit of consolation: Saturday's championship game will be televised on <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Premier Calls Scandal a Conspiracy, Denies Involvement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> on Wednesday denied any involvement in a financial scandal rocking the country and called it an international conspiracy to topple his Socialist government. In a 15-minute televised address to the nation, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> also said he will sue the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> news magazine Time for defamation, both in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and abroad, over an interview it carried with the fugitive banker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>. `` I felt the need to communicate with you because for the first time in my political life my character is being doubted. ... I want to make clear that not a trace of the mud that is flying from all quarters involves me,'' the 70-year-old leader said. In the magazine report, <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, the former chairman of the privately-owned <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION>, accused <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and other senior Socialist leaders of demanding and receiving millions of dollars in payoffs from his bank. The 34-year-old banker, who rose to fame creating a publishing empire in just four years, fled the country in November after being indicted in the $ 200 million fraud, forgery and embezzlement scandal. Time ran the story in its March 13 issue following a series of six interviews with the financier in a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> prison, where he is awaiting an extradition hearing scheduled for March 16. `` Time is a magazine of the American establishment. ... Now we can see clearly which forces are hiding behind the attempts to uproot democracy in our country,'' <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> said in the address. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> added that the attempts to overthrow his government will continue up until the June 1989 general elections. The <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> affair has spurred both the Conservative and Communist opposition parties to call for the leader's immediate resignation. The government has also come under increasing attack from members of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- for its handling of the scandal. In the five months since the scandal first emerged it has triggered the resignations of seven Cabinet members. Although the government has maintained from the start that the allegations were part of a domestic and foreign-inspired plot to usurp <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> from power, it has avoided naming the forces behind it. Recent opinion polls have indicated that <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s popularity has declined sharply in the past six months because of his highly public extramarital liasion with a former air hostess. The premier, who underwent open heart surgery in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> last fall, made the address from his suburban home in <LOCATION> Kastri </LOCATION>. He has been living with his 34-year-old girlfriend in a nearby villa since his return from the British capital. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s televised address was delayed when journalists went on a three-hour strike. The walkout was called by the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION> at the two state-run television channels to protest the government's alleged monopoly of the medium and the behavior of state officials toward the news media.

 Vandals targeting an anti-abortion group also have been hitting an organization with a similar name that is dedicated to gathering information on servicemen missing in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The office of <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the missing-in-action group, and the office of <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, the anti-abortion group, were vandalized late Sunday night or early Monday. The vandals left wire coat hangers, silhouettes of people in red spray paint and leaflets stating `` Operation Rescue Operation Death.'' `` They think we're this other group,'' said <PERSON> Krista </PERSON> <PERSON> Eppley </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> MIA </ORGANIZATION> group, <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which was founded in 1983. She said there have been other misdirected hostilities over the last two months. `` The phone messages have been all fairly radical, real ugly and threatening,'' she said Monday. Police Lt. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON> said the vandals have not been identified, and said the damage was under investigation as malicious mischief. Operation Rescue of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, part of a national group that demonstrates at clinics where abortions are performed, opened an office here in January. Ms. <PERSON> Eppley </PERSON> said she's asked the anti-abortion group to change its name. `` We've been around for a long time; it's not like we're some new kid on the block,'' she said. `` I do n't want to have to worry about some weirdo shooting at me.'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, the anti-abortion group's director, apologized for the other group's distress but said the name would not be changed. He said the telephone company has been asked to clarify the directory listing and that the group is also planning to move to another city. `` We sympathize with them and feel really bad,'' he said. `` Hopefully, whoever is responsible for this will realize what a foolish mistake they made.''

 Four more Democratic senators turned down the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday and declared their opposition to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> to be defense secretary, but Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> tried to stave off defeat by proposing an extraordinary six-month trial confirmation. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said the trial period would let senators judge whether Tower lived up to his no-drinking pledge. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> expressed `` immediate serious concerns'' over the proposal, but promised to consider it overnight. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> made his dramatic bid to salvage the nomination at the end of the fifth day of a draining <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate, and it followed the decision by four more Democrats to vote against Tower, giving opponents of Tower a majority. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> conceded it would `` take a miracle to win confirmation.'' Under <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s proposal, Tower would be confirmed, but would submit a letter of resignation to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dated Oct. 1, 1989. If Tower's performance were satisfactory, there `` probably'' would be no need to reconfirm him, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. Otherwise, `` he probably would n't be the nominee.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he offered his proposal after discussing it with Tower. It came as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> neared a climax in its bitter struggle over the nomination. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> became the third Democrat to endorse Tower's confirmation, but his speech was bracketed by declarations of opposition from <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> _ Democrats who had been lobbied hard by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration as potential pro-Tower votes. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey found 51 Democrats and Republican Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> either solidly opposed or leaning against confirmation with 41 Republicans and three Democrats either supporting or leaning in favor of the nomination. Democrats hold a 55-45 edge in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> made his extraordinary proposal to deal with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> concerns over <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>'s history of drinking. `` I think we ought to give him a second chance that many of us have had,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who was seriously wounded during World War II but has risen to a position of power and prominence in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` It gives this <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> a second opportunity. It addresses the concerns raised by the chairman and the majority leader and by others at the same time it gives President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> his choice for secretary of defense,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. Earlier, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> suggested Tower be permitted to come to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and answer the allegations against him, but did not immediately press the issue when <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> objected. There was little doubt that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s maneuverings were his final bid to save the nomination. Earlier, he conceded it would `` take a miracle'' to do so, and <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>'s speech seemed to deflate <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> hopes. `` In the nuclear age we ca n't afford to take a chance on the man who holds the future in his hands,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. The <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Democrat said he was troubled by Tower's drinking habits and noted that alcohol altered the former senator's judgment. `` There seems to be a personality change that occurs in Senator Tower,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. Earlier, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> became the third Democrat to support the embattled nomination, saying, `` I hope that when I get the next chance to talk with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> about the tough job of keeping this country strong, it will be while he's in his new office at the Pentagon.'' `` I'm both honored to have his prestigious support, and grateful for his humane understanding of what my family has endured,'' Tower said. Despite <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s decision, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> repeated his claim the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will reject the nomination, and he led a chorus of Democrats who called for a quick vote. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he was ready to vote `` as soon as possible. A reasonable time would be tomorrow.'' Tower, who served in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from 1961 to 1984, has been dogged by allegations of excessive drinking and womanizing as well as questions about his lucrative defense consulting contracts since retirement from government service. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s decision to support the nominee was high drama. The former vice presidential candidate praised the work of fellow Democrats who have opposed the nomination _ <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> senator who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, but said he would support the a man with whom he served in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for 14 years. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> noted that in January he had introduced Tower to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and said he was qualified to be defense secretary. Since then, he said, he has read the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report and heard the accusations against Tower. `` I found most of the allegations about <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s personal life without enough basis to deny a president his choice,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the influential <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman who had been courted by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after the nomination ran aground. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> conceded that the nomination process, which has been so difficult for Tower, has been equally painful for himself. `` In the passion of debate, pundits writing in the isolation of their own offices, can forget that public figures have feelings,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` We have seen every imperfection in an essentially good man dragged into the pitiless glare of television lights while his daughters sat listening.'' After <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> made his announcement, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, who has led the fight against <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>'s confirmation, walked over and shook his hand. Watching the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proceedings were Tower's daughters, <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, R-Wyo., ushered the two women outside the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gallery and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> greeted each of them with a hug

The CBS show `` Murphy Brown'' required three permanent sets, the television office and studio where <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Candice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> -RRB- and the others do `` FYI,'' the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bar where they meet after work, and <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s townhouse in <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>. He said the job of the production designer is to `` design everything you see on the screen except people.'' The designer also coordinates the wardrobe, special effects, props and set decoration. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> obtained pictures and background material from the research library at <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, where the show is made. `` I looked at the pictures of television offices but I wanted more glamor,'' he said. `` I finally found what I needed in pictures of the offices of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>. I wanted a high-tech slickness. `` <PERSON> Candice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> called me to say hello. She said, ` Please do n't put any orange carpet on the set.' Her townhouse seems to be in a permanent state of re-decoration. <PERSON> Eldin </PERSON>, the painter, has become a fixture on the show. `` <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON> liked the show and asked to be on,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>. `` They wrote a part for her as <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s mother. She said she had only one request. We thought, ` Oh, no, here comes the request for <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>'s old office as her dressing room.' But what she wanted was a scene with <PERSON> Eldin </PERSON> the painter.'' Two Christopher-designed shows are coming up. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> will present `` In the Mood: The <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> Band Reunion.'' On Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> will telecast `` The People's Choice Awards.'' `` I wanted a 1940s big band look for the <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> show,'' he said. `` It's almost art deco black and white. I put in two balconies over the stage for people to sit. That harks back to the days of the Macambo night club. `` In an awards show, you go for glamor and short entrances for the winners and presenters. The first awards show I designed it took 15 seconds for the entrances. With entrances like that a show could take 16 hours. So, you go for short entrances and good backgrounds. Half of my job is glamorizing show business.'' <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> has designed five Academy Award shows, five Emmy shows, three Grammy shows and four TV Academy Hall of Fame telecasts. He recently designed the upcoming <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> series `` The Robert Guillaume Show'' and `` Ghost Writer,'' a pilot for <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>. He is currently working on another pilot about a fashion model called `` The High Life.'' `` I like to do sets like ` <PERSON> Chico </PERSON> and the Man,' which was an old garage. Or I like to do those that are lush and expensive,'' he said. When he designed `` Our Town'' it presented a challenge because it's done on a bare stage. `` I painted the whole stage like a Grant Wood painting,'' he said. `` Then I suspended scrims to represent roof tops. From up high it gives the illusion of being a town. But when you get down to ground level you see it's a bare stage.'' <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, who lives in a loft in downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that he and his wife, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, a set decorator, designed, works for television and the stage, but stays away from feature films. `` Most of them are done on location,'' he said. `` I like to sit down and design stuff. I like to create an illusion of reality. Feature films just re-create reality.''

<TEXT>
 Public television viewers can get a look at <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON>' Oscar-nominated performance in `` Stand and Deliver'' this week on PBS' `` American Playhouse'' series. <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON>, who won an Emmy for best supporting actor playing taciturn Lt. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Miami Vice,'' is up for an Academy Award this year as Best Actor for his brilliant performance as tough, playful, real-life mathematics teacher <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>, whose offbeat style of teaching inspired his disadvantaged <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> students to go on to higher education. The film also stars <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> -LRB- `` La Bamba'' -RRB- as one of the students. It airs Wednesday on `` American Playhouse'' on PBS. <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON> has displayed his acting range before in an `` American Playhouse'' film, `` The Ballad of <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON>.'' He played the title character, a quiet, law-abiding south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> horseman who has to flee an unjust accusation of murder after a fatal misunderstanding over a simple Spanish word. In `` Stand and Deliver,'' <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON> goes in the opposite direction as the charismatic <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>, who badgerd and cajoled even barrio gang members to sign a `` contract'' promising to spend 30 hours a week on homework, stay after school and take extra classes in the summer. <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON> even submitted to treatments to make his hair thin so he would resemble the balding <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>. The Bolivian-born <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> gave up a successful career in electronics to teach high school. He was supposed to teach computers, but when he arrived at the school, there were no computers. There were, however, students, and <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> began to teach them calculus. The movie centers on the students in <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>'s 1982 class, 18 of whom took an advanced placement test in calculus. They did remarkably well. But the testing service became suspicious when their wrong answers were too similar, and they were accused of cheating and disqualified. <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> believed the students' scores would never have been challenged had they not had Hispanic surnames. The film does suggest in one subtle scene that a glitch in <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>'s teaching methods might have been the reason the students all made the same minor mistakes. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> plays one of the toughs in <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>'s class. He is smart enough to understand what <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON> is offering him _ a way out of poverty. But he has to save face with his gang, so he asks for an extra book. See, he ca n't be seen carrying schoolbooks around, so he'll keep one at home and one at school. Some of the other students are played by <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Karla </PERSON> <PERSON> Montana </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>. The film was co-written by <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> -LRB- `` Borderline'' -RRB- and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Musca </PERSON> -LRB- `` Nikita'' -RRB-. <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> directed. `` Stand and Deliver'' is an example of a financing arrangement through which <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> helps pay production costs in exchange for television rights. The deal has resulted in some of the most talked-about independent films in recent years, including `` Testament'' in 1983, `` El Norte'' in 1984, `` Smooth Talk'' in 1985, and last year's critically acclaimed documentary `` The Thin Blue Line,'' which recently led to the overturning of a murder conviction. It will appear on `` American Playhouse'' next season.

<HEAD>Panel's Plan Would Streamline Budget-Making</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 That commission hunting for a politically blameless way to deal with budget deficits had to give up the search _ but it did leave some advice on better ways for the government to make spending decisions. That's something <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been seeking since it went into business, 200 years ago. In a way, the process almost came full circle. The first <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed a single appropriations bill and entrusted specific spending decisions to the White House. After all, if you could n't trust <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>. ... By the 1980s, the appropriations process had become so cumbersome and contentious that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> twice despaired of passing individual money bills and piled everything into a single mammoth resolution, full of detailed orders and restrictions. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed under protest, accepting items he opposed in order to get others he wanted, and to keep the government going. He'd vetoed one catchall appropriations resolution during his first term, producing a temporary government shutdown rather than accept spending he said would bust his austerity budget. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he will not accept a single, catchall money measure. `` I am going to refuse to sign another omnibus spending bill,'' he said as a candidate. That may be put to the test. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> managed to pass all its money bills on time during the last budget year because of an agreement reached under the pressure of the 1987 stock market crash. With no crisis to enforce discipline, that performance will be difficult to match. While it expired without a bipartisan consensus on deficit reduction measures, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> did agree that any plan to cut deficits will have to include changes in the way government spending decisions are made. `` The balance of power on budget issues has swung too far from the executive and toward the legislative branch,'' the commission's <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> majority said The panel's Democrats did n't go quite that far. After all, these days legislative equals Democrats and executive equals Republicans. Historically, though, the issue has involved the powers of two branches of government rather than competition between the two parties. The commission's 14 members were unanimous on one specific change in the system, suggesting that the government move to two-year budgets instead of enacting a new one each year. They also agreed that budget goals should be drawn more clearly and enforced more stringently. The modern budgeting process dates from 1921, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> began requiring presidents to submit detailed annual budgets. That put the executive branch in charge, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been whittling at its authority ever since. The current congressional budget system was installed in the name of reform in 1974, setting a series of legislative timetables <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> seldom manages to meet. That law limited the power of presidents to withhold money <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appropriates, a device that had been used by presidents of both parties, but one that became most bitterly disputed when <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> used it to block increases in more than 100 domestic programs. Presidents have been trying to get around that barrier ever since. Under the law, a president can not withhold appropriated funds unless he advises <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and gets its permission within 45 days. `` At the very least,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in his first budget message, `` when a president proposes to rescind federal spending, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should be required to vote on that proposal instead of killing it by inaction.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also seeks the line item veto, authority for a president to knock a single spending item out of an appropriations bill without rejecting the whole bill. That wo n't happen easily, if at all, because it would undo one of the ways <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can force a president to accept what it wants done. When an entire appropriation is hostage to an unwanted provision, presidents often sign rather than fight. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had sought the same thing, and the economic commission majority said presidents should have authority either to veto line items or to rescind appropriations once they have become law. Commission Republicans advocated a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget and, in a bow to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s no-new-taxes pledge, said it should include a ceiling on revenues that can be collected. They also recommended what would amount to a permanent system of appropriations, proposing that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> set up spending resolutions that would continue automatically at the previous year's dollar levels, with no increase for inflation. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is a lot better at setting deadlines than at meeting them, so that might be the most significant change of all were it to happen. It wo n't.

 The coffee shop on Bleecker Street where <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> had wanted to meet was jam-packed with soggy tourists seeking refuge from the sudden downpour. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> pushed his way through the crowd and suggested a quick sprint to his apartment a block away. Inside the fourth-floor walkup, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> checked the refrigerator for vittles and extracted white bread, mayonnaise and cold <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION>, which he graciously offered his guest _ no thanks _ who was busy removing drying sweatsocks from the back of the vinyl dining-room chair. While slathering mayo on bread, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> considered comparisons of the show on which he stars, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s `` Married ... With Children,'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s new sitcom, `` Roseanne.'' Both are centered on lower-middle-class families with kids. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, a hapless shoe salesman with a primping, stay-at-home wife -LRB- <PERSON> Katey </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagal </PERSON> -RRB- and two borderline juvenile-delinquent kids -LRB- <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Applegate </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Faustino </PERSON> -RRB-. On `` Roseanne,'' plump protagonists <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> struggle valiantly, if sardonically, against the financial realities of the blue-collar'80s, surrounded by a halo of family love. `` I like the idea that they -LRB- ` Roseanne' -RRB- have people who are n't typically real good-looking, you know, television-type people, character people, and that's nice, I think I think that's part of the appeal of it, it's just kinda like folks,'' said <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> who grew up in <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the son of a truck driver. On `` Married ... With Children,'' it's a little more work to find any evidence of familial love. It is suggested to <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> that the humor on his show is, well, kind of mean. `` The thing I like about our show is that we are mean-spirited a lot of times,'' he said. `` We do n't even try to hide it or make excuses for it.'' No kidding. A couple of major sponsors recently pulled advertising from `` Married ... With Children'' because of a letter campaign by a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> housewife who said she found the show anti-family. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> says it has a waiting list for commercial spots nevertheless. In a recent episode, the <ORGANIZATION> Bundys </ORGANIZATION> gleefully hied to a fancy restaurant to blow the pittance a deceased relative had left them. When the bill came, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> realized he had left his wallet at home. The kids, sent to fetch the money, were faced with a moral dilemma _ return to bail out the folks, or purchase tickets to that night's Tears and Vomit concert The kids split with the cash. Such no-holds-barred slaps at typical sitcom family life have found an audience for <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. `` Married ... With Children'' is pulling a network-quality share of the Sunday audience and has become a force to be reckoned with by the big guys at <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, a serious <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stage actor who had found some success guesting on network shows and starring in a couple of pilots, heard about the new <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> network on a trip to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` I read it, and I was laughing,'' he recalled. `` And I went in and read for them -LRB- executive producers <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Leavitt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Moye </PERSON> -RRB-, and they were such funny guys. They were such off-the-wall characters, I immediately thought, ` I like this.' ... I had, like, this connection to the character.'' Back in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, his agent advised to pass on the sitcom, since he was `` hot'' at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, having starred in the made-for-TV movie `` <PERSON> Popeye </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>.'' `` So I said, ` OK, pass.' So about 20 minutes later, I'm just sitting here, thinking, ` I like that.' So I called <LOCATION> L.A </LOCATION>. I said, ` All right, if they'll give me $ 4,000 more a week, tell'em they have a deal and I'll be there in the morning.''' Now <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> has become something of a latter-day <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramden </PERSON>. Fans, who know him as `` Al,'' stop him on the street. `` Somehow they identify with the guy. They relate to him some way. And I know I did when I read the pilot. It just reminded me of a couple of my uncles. It's a self-deprecating humor. People that do n't have a lot going for them, the ones that always interest me the most are the ones who can laugh at their situation a lot as sort of a way through it, and I saw that in the character.''

<HEAD>Tissue from Aborted Fetuses at Center of Scientific, Ethical Debate</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The use of aborted fetuses is redefining the ground rules of medical research, pitting scientists who hope to alleviate suffering against ethicists who fear the specter of Nazi-style experimentation on unwilling subjects. Critics of fetal tissue research envision abortion-for-profit from tissue sales and foresee organ `` parts shops'' in hospitals. Proponents counter that researchers are steering a morally neutral course. Can science separate the use of human material from the way it was obtained? That central ethical question of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuremburg </ORGANIZATION> medical trials following World War II is being raised again over fetal tissue research, a new frontier of medicine. `` The only answer to this obviously is the answer ... which our whole culture is in anguish over: Are these people -LRB- fetuses -RRB- human beings?'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuhaus </PERSON>, a Lutheran theologian who was among more than 500 signers of an interfaith letter urging the federal government to ban funding for research using intentionally aborted fetuses. `` If we learned anything from the medical trials at <LOCATION> Nuremberg </LOCATION>, it is that science is not in itself good. It can be used for good or evil,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Doerflinger </PERSON>, associate director of the Office of Pro-Life Activities of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our point is, the way science is implemented has to respect human dignity.'' On the other side there are human concerns, too. For decades, a 52-year-old patient of Dr. <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Freed </PERSON> has suffered from degenerative Parkinson's disease but now, after implants of fetal tissue to the brain, the man is improving, said Freed of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The implants may alleviate the sudden loss of function and other symptoms that <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>'s sufferers endure. `` They may find themselves frozen sitting in church, for example,'' Freed said. `` It would be that kind of phenomenon, eliminating freezing episodes.'' A special <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> decided last December it would be `` acceptable'' for the federal government to back medical research involving the transplant of tissue of intentionally aborted fetuses. And a month later, at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> classified right-to-life advocates who would ban all research with fetal tissues as among `` the enemies of scientific progress.'' Researchers hope that transplanting fetal cells into people with diabetes and <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>'s disease may provide an effective treatment, and also see the potential such research has for similarly treating other serious diseases such as Alzheimer's. Tissue can be obtained elsewhere, including from the patient's own body, but some experts say fetal tissue has the advantages of eliminating the need for surgery on the patient to gather the tissue and its immaturity may make it more adaptable `` We must separate the issue of abortion from medical research,'' said the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION>, retired federal appeals Judge <PERSON> Arlin </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The committee recommended guidelines such as prohibiting profits from the sale f fetal tissue, but the panel's majority opinion was that the ethics of where the tissue was obtained largely should not be considered. If not used, fetal brain cells and other tissues would simply be discarded, say many researchers who see no reflection of the moral abyss of the Nazi era. `` From my perspective, the bottom line is, once a woman decides she's going to have an abortion ... I just do n't understand why it -LRB- fetal tissue -RRB- should n't be used,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Genel </PERSON>, a professor of pediatrics and an associate dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. `` I say this as one who had a substantial number of my family destroyed in the Holocaust.'' To others, it's impossible to distance the act of abortion from the use of resulting fetal tissue. `` It's as separate as me being here and you being there and we being held together by only the one bullet which I have just fired,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Burtchaell </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> panel who dissented from its report. `` It's an absurd claim.'' <PERSON> Burtchaell </PERSON>, a professor of moral theology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION>, said government sponsorship of fetal tissue research would be the most powerful expression of public approval of abortion since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision in <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. The ambivalence and misgivings that make the abortion decision so painful for some women `` could easily be relieved by the rationalization, yes, this is a tragic thing, but some good could come out of it,'' <PERSON> Burtchaell </PERSON> said. If the research becomes profitable, ethical concerns may be forgotten, <PERSON> Neuhaus </PERSON> added. `` Health is big bucks, superbucks, mega bucks. ... There are few things Americans are willing to pay more for than health for the prolongation of life,'' he said. `` The commercial dynamics are powerfully on the side of blocking out moral reflection. It is not in any way far-fetched to envision that in not too many years every hospital will have a parts shop.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, sees a `` vexing moral problem'' with using aborted fetal tissue and believes research must be closely regulated. Fetal tissue should be handled, he said, through a third-party system like that used for organ donations. Such donations are regulated to separate the physicians awaiting the organ from the patient's treatment, in order to assure the patient, as <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> put it, `` I'm not trying to kill you to get your parts.'' It also is no longer simply academic speculation that someone might create life to destroy it for valuable tissue, <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> said. `` I know of three people who have been willing to get pregnant to donate tissue either to themselves or a family member.''

But science per se is neutral, <PERSON> Rudin </PERSON> said. `` Our moral and public policy guidelines are just now catching up with what we're capable of doing.''

<HEAD>Mutual Fund Taxes: A Matter of Records</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For mutual fund investors who do n't keep careful records, tax time can bring some big-league headaches. Like anybody else, fund investors can turn the labors of filling out the forms over to a hired expert familiar with all the twists and turns of the tax code. But even an accounting wizard ca n't do much for them if they do n't have the proper records of all their activity. Suppose you cashed in half of a $ 10,000 holding of fund shares in 1988 to treat yourself to a hard-earned vacation. How much of that $ 5,000 is subject to tax? It depends on your `` cost basis'' for those shares, which can be computed in several different ways. The cost basis includes not only the cash you used to buy into the fund but any dividends and capital gains distributions that were subsequently reinvested in additional shares. `` Investors sometimes sell fund shares without realizing that reinvested dividends have raised their total cost basis,'' observes <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in its weekly advisory publication, The Outlook. `` So they pay taxes on the income a second time.'' Let's assume, for the sake of illustration, that you began investing in Hypothetical Fund several years ago with $ 5,000. Over the five subsequent years, the fund paid dividends and capital gains distributions totaling $ 2,500. Even though you had the payouts automatically reinvested in additional shares, you were obliged to report them as taxable income in the year they were made. Then suppose that last year, at a point when your investment was worth $ 10,000, you wearied of the ups and downs of the stock and bond markets and switched it into a money fund. Such switches are considered tantamount to selling one investment and buying another, creating what accountants call a `` taxable event.'' If you thought of your cost as only your original cash outlay, that left you with a capital gain of $ 5,000. But if you had kept a file of statements from the fund over the years, you would be able to determine, and to substantiate, that your cost basis was actually $ 7,500, thus cutting your taxable gain in half. In the real world, of course, even modest mutual fund accounts are rarely as simple as that example, with its convenient round numbers. Many fund investors make multiple purchases over time in their efforts to accumulate a nest egg. All that, however, only makes good record-keeping more important. The right records are essential if you want to take advantage of a system called the `` actual cost'' method of determining your tax liability when you sell. Let's say you made purchases of a fund at times when its net asset value stood at $ 10 and $ 14, and now you want to redeem some of your shares with the net asset value back down at $ 12. If you can identify the shares in your redemption letter as those you bought for $ 14, and get confirmation from the fund that it followed your instructions specifically, that allows you to claim a capital loss that may be deductible on your tax return. `` The key to this method is detailed and accurate record keeping,'' says <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s Moneyletter, an advisory publication on matters of personal finance. `` You have to accurately document what you buy or sell, when and for how much. But your effort is well worth it.''

<HEAD>USDA Foreign Attaches Not Noted for Linguistics, Says GAO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In most cases, says a federal review, the people hired by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to be the eyes and ears of American farmers in foreign countries ca n't talk turkey unless the conversation is in English. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative agency of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, found the language gap in the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which has maintained an overseas network of agricultural attaches for more than 30 years to help promote <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm commodities. During the 1988 fiscal year, which ended last Sept. 30, the service _ primarily at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies _ operated 65 posts and 14 agricultural trade offices overseas with 103 attaches responsible for representing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm interests in more than 100 countries. The agency also employs about 160 foreign nationals to help attaches in those offices. Last year's budget for those foreign operations was $ 24.8 million. Rep. <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kika </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, asked for a review of the attache system. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report was submitted to him last month. Historically, the report said, the criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency has focused on requirements that the attaches make too many reports that take time away from market development functions. Recent changes have helped ease that situation, but further improvements should be made. One of the most glaring deficiencies in the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> involves language skills, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said, which are necessary `` to effectively communicate'' in host countries. `` The service has not formally set minimum proficiency levels for the principal language of the country to which the attache is assigned,'' the report said. `` The service believes that a speaking-reading proficiency level of 3 -LRB- based on a 0 to 5 scale -RRB- is sufficient to perform the general business activities of attaches but that a higher proficiency level is required to conduct sensitive or technical negotiations.'' Among 93 attaches assigned as of September 1987 to countries with non-English languages, only 24 _ 26 percent _ had at least the level 3 proficiency, the report said. By comparison, a list of 1,021 <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees assigned to <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> jobs showed that 676, or 66 percent, showed at least a level 3 language proficiency. The FAS told investigators that some of the attaches -LRB- which included trade officers and higher-ranked agricultural counselors for purposes of the review -RRB- had not yet completed five years of foreign service, the minimum time allowed for achieving language proficiency. Others had been commissioned as attaches in languages different from that required in posts at the time of the review, and sometimes under different standards prior to current requirements. Also, the agency said, `` foreign service nationals,'' or FSNs, can readily provide translations needed to gather and read information in a foreign language in the overseas posts. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report concluded that attaches `` generally appear to possess acceptable levels of education and experience'' when they are accepted as overseas candidates but that `` the majority of attaches seem to fall short in their ability to communicate effectively in the principal foreign language practiced in their host countries.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said in a letter responding to the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report that the agency `` fully concurs'' that language efficiency should be improved. `` And we are already doing more,'' he said. `` We have designated five languages _ Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic and <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> as hard languages _ and we are now providing a year's language training.'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said the agency's policy is to rotate overseas staff back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> more frequently before going out to another job and that this will also help `` assure that they get more adequate language training.'' But <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said that `` due to personnel and monetary restraints'' the agency can not provide extensive training in seldom-used languages that attaches would be only expected to serve once in their careers, or in posts where English is widely used. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> included a list of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> posts in countries where a foreign language is not required. Those are: <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. In addition, the agency operates in five overseas posts `` where English will suffice'' for attaches: <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 In theory, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is insulated from politics. But that is n't stopping the opposing sides on the abortion issue from mounting intense lobbying campaigns as the justices prepare to hear a controversial <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case that could end the country's current era of legal abortions. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is expected to hear the appeal, Webs, which favors abortion on demand. `` Our people want the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who's pushing the court on this issue, to know just how they feel,'' she said `` We are co-sponsoring what promises to be a massive march in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on April 9th and I wo n't be surprised if a quarter of a million demonstrators show up; our people are furious.'' <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON>, who is coordinating NOW's role in the march, said she thinks a big turnout wo n't go unnoticed at the court. `` Whatever the decision is,'' she said, `` it will be couched in legal terms but, in fact, it is a political question that, like Prohibition, ultimately will be decided by public opinion.'' <PERSON> Judie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> which opposes legalized abortions, said she, too, thinks political considerations will weigh heavily in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision. `` Public opinion means everything to the court,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who says her organization includes 200,000 families around the country. `` We feel all forms of expression will impact on the court.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s most expensive form of expression will be a series of full-page advertisements in <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times. The ads will run during the week before the opposition's April march and will cost $ 150,000. `` They will include just-released information we've taken from the file of the late Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> during the debate on <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>,'' she said. `` It's clear from these files that a small but very vocal minority was able to influence the decision which made abortion legal in this country.'' In <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, the court held that while a woman's right to privacy gives her the right to have an abortion, the state may regulate or prohibit abortions once the fetus is viable. Since the 1973 decision, there have been relatively few third-trimester abortions even though that same court, in <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>, said the mother's life or health should be an overriding factor in the decision of whether to permit an abortion even after the fetus is viable. In case to be in April, the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> passed a 1986 statute banning abortions at public hospitals or any other public facilities unless the woman's life is in danger. The act, whose preamble states that viability begins at conception, also forbids public funds from being used for abortions or for abortion counseling except when the mother's life is threatened. The statute was challenged immediately by two abortion clinics, <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and Planned Parenthood in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In March 1987, a federal district judge in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> declared the major sections of the statute to be unconstitutional infringements of <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. In July 1987, the 8th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the bulk of the lower court's decision. Last year, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s attorney general, asked the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to review the case. He also asked the court, if it should side with the appeals courts, to then consider whether <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> itself is constitutional. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> announced in January it would consider the case, setting off a flurry of planning and activity on both sides of the issue. `` We've already raised most of the $ 150,000 for our upcoming newspaper ads,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, adding that $ 150,000 is an exceptionally large expenditure for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> already has spent more than $ 500,000 on newspaper advertising. The full-page ads, which feature a coat hanger, a reminder of the days of back-alley abortions, first ran on Jan. 22. `` We're running them in some of the major newspapers across the country,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NARAL </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director. `` We're also doing radio and TV ads and making ourselves available to the media for interviews and talk shows and the like. So far, she said, there has been a tremendous response to the ads, which ask for pledges of support. `` We've had more than 30,000 responses to the January ads,'' she said. `` The ads cost $ 300,000 and we took in $ 350,000.'' <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON> said while <ORGANIZATION> NARAL </ORGANIZATION> sees a drawn-out fight over the abortion issue, she feels the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> can be influenced. `` There's no doubt we're in trouble, given the changes in the court since <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>,'' she said. `` But the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> does n't act in a vacuum; it is sensitive to the political and social climate of the country.'' Because of this, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, acting president of the <ORGANIZATION> Planned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parenthood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, his group is trying to mobilize mainstream Americans. `` There's no question this is a political issue and, while the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ca n't be lobbied directly, it can influenced by a great outpouring of voices,'' he said. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> MacGear </PERSON> of Operation Rescue, a <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based, pro-life group which has helped stage protests at abortion clinics around the country, said, `` We plan keeping with our agenda'' of demonstrations and civil disobedience. `` Frankly,'' she added, `` I do n't know whether the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> can be swayed by what happens in the streets but we're watching closely. What we're really hoping for, though, is a right-to-life amendment to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Constitution.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, legal director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right-To-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged that the court's acceptance of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case and the resulting news media focus have `` provided an unusual forum.'' He said he has been `` kind of amused'' by some of the efforts to get the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s attention. `` In our view,'' he said, `` these efforts are unlikely to influence the case. Our legal brief certainly is n't going to talk about the Harris Poll, it talks about the Constitution.'' Then, he added, `` but <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> was a political decision, an act of judicial lawmaking.''

<HEAD>Italian Financier Denounces Report of Money Laundering, Mafia Ties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Giancarlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Parretti </PERSON>, the Italian financier trying to assemble a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> movie powerhouse, denounced news reports suggesting he has been involved in money laundering and has ties to the Mafia. <PERSON> Parretti </PERSON>, who with a partner has in recent months bought controlling interests in the <ORGANIZATION> Cannon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Pathe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cinema </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, said in a news release that the money for the purchases came from legitimate sources. Reports in the trade and financial press have questioned the source of <PERSON> Parretti </PERSON>'s money, as he and his partner, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiorini </PERSON>, invest with the avowed goal of becoming a significant force in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. A Business Week magazine article March 13 quoted unidentified associates of <PERSON> Parretti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fiorini </PERSON> as saying the pair's network of foreign holding companies include money-laundering operations. The magazine said associates of <PERSON> Fiorini </PERSON> have warned him that <PERSON> Parretti </PERSON> has ties with Sicilian crime families. `` The article makes untrue and baseless accusations of money laundering,'' <PERSON> Parretti </PERSON> said in his news release Monday, citing outside audits of his companies. `` The suggestion of supposed ` close ties with Sicilian crime families' is slanderous and totally false.'' The magazine's editor in chief, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, responded in a statement: `` We have nothing to add except to note that Business Week already printed Mr. <PERSON> Parretti </PERSON>'s denial in our story.'' <PERSON> Parretti </PERSON>, through an employee, refused an interview request Tuesday. <PERSON> Parretti </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Orvieto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, has been charged with criminal offenses twice in that country and jailed briefly, according to Business Week and an article last week in the Wall Street Journal. He was acquitted of charges that he defrauded a bank that failed in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION> and is awaiting trial on charges stemming from alleged misstatement of the balance sheet of his soccer team, <PERSON> Siracusa </PERSON> <PERSON> Calcio </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>, the magazine said. Additionally, <PERSON> Parretti </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in 1986, but the extortion charge was dropped, Business Week said. <PERSON> Parretti </PERSON> says he and his partner intend to assemble their various movie assets into an entertainment conglomerate under the name <ORGANIZATION> Pathe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>. It will be headed by moviemaker <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who brought `` Star Wars'' to the screen, they say. Through holding companies, <PERSON> Parretti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fiorini </PERSON> control <ORGANIZATION> Melia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a Spanish travel agency, and <PERSON> Renta </PERSON> <PERSON> Inmobiliaria </PERSON>, a Spanish real estate firm. Separately, <PERSON> Fiorini </PERSON> is part-owner of <ORGANIZATION> Sasea </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> merchant bank. They recently bid $ 22 million for <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laurentiis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is in Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy proceedings, and have hinted interest in <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Reported prices for the pair's recent acquisitions include $ 150 million for <ORGANIZATION> Pathe </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and $ 138 million for <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> Financing for the recent acquisitions was arranged through <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lyonnais </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and public and private equity and revenue from the pair's various firms, <PERSON> Parretti </PERSON> said.

 Industrialized nations committed themselves to banning chemicals destroying the ozone layer, but they reacted coolly to Third World demands for money to find substitutes. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and other populous developing nations embarking on mass production of consumer goods containing chlorofluorocarbons reason that since the West invented and produces most of the ozone-destroying chemicals, the West should pay to replace them. Despite the split, the 123 countries at an international conference on the ozone layer agreed Tuesday that pressure is on scientists and industry to find safe alternatives before more damage is done to the fragile atmospheric shield.

 The stock market posted a small loss Tuesday after the Dow Jones industrial average made a short-lived run past the 2,300 level. The average fell 4.11 to 2,290.71. The dollar rose against most foreign currencies. Bond prices fell slightly as traders awaited Friday's release of February unemployment figures. A resurgence of commercial and speculative buying pushed platinum futures prices to a 3-month high, boosting gold and silver futures as well; crude-oil futures tumbled; soybeans retreated; grains were mixed; cattle futures advanced; and pork futures fell.

 For patrons of the heavily traveled <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> air routes, a by-the-book pilot job action to support <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strikers had little effect, but that did n't stop people from talking and griping about it. The travails of the airline industry seemed to be on many passenger minds Tuesday, the first day of the job action by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in response to what the union called safety concerns raised by the Eastern strike. If a <LOCATION> Miami-Atlanta-Washington-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> itinerary was any indication, there were delays of up to an hour for reasons that ranged from bad weather to luggage-loading, runway deicing and overbooking. That could be any typical flying day during the winter on one of the nation's most congested air routes. But when a nearly full <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was waylaid for what the cockpit crew called a cargo delay, many passengers immediately suspected the pilots were behind it and were n't pleased. `` I think it's in poor taste. Nobody wins,'' said <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, a merchant marine captain en route to <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>. Another passenger, <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizenzi </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> engineer, said, `` I think they're doing it more out of sympathy. At a layover in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s sprawling <LOCATION> Hartsfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> counters were eerily empty, their erstwhile patrons swarming to alternate flights on <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, the region's dominant airline. Eastern pickets walked peacefully, saying they were n't surprised at their employer's decision to ground most flights in response to the refusal by pilots and flight attendants to honor a strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union. `` Finally, the company was truthful with the American flying public,'' said <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>, a 10 -LCB- - year <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilot He said the pilot slowdown `` demonstrated that <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> is united in our support of the Machinists' position.'' Later, on a fully booked <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> flight, the plane was delayed half an hour at the terminal because of what agents called a delay at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> for runway deicing. Shortly before the plane began its descent, the cockpit crew informed passengers the plane would have to circle because of an unspecified air traffic problem at National. `` We really ca n't adequately explain the delay,'' the flight captain said. That riled some business passengers already miffed about the earlier stall. `` The pilots are antagonizing the public,'' said a company executive, who spoke with a reporter but did n't want to be quoted by name. `` They're making me upset right now and that's stupid.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> opposed part of the Wall Street firm's landmark securities fraud settlement but went along with it out of fear the government would bring more serious charges, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive is quoted as saying in court papers. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> agreed to dismiss bond trader <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and withhold his pay depite the company's disagreement with the terms, Chief Executive <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said in a separate filing Tuesday. It was the first time <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> publicly asserted that the firm opposed parts of the $ 650 million criminal plea agreement reached in December. Lawyers for <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> told employees that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> settled because the government planned to bring charges under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corruption Organizations act that could have frozen billions of dollars of the firm's assets. The documents were filed in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal court as part of a challenge by <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, also a <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> executive, to provisions of the criminal settlement that capped a two-year investigation of securities law violations. `` They were going to indict us under RICO ... -LRB- and -RRB- there would be a multihundred-million-dollar forefeiture,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said Jan. 6 in a telephone hookup with employees, papers filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION> stated. `` We ultimately concluded the bottom line was the firm absolutely had to settle _ that a financial institution can not stand up to a RICO indictment,'' he stated, according to the court papers. The plea agreement forces <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to dismiss <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and withhold his more than $ 100 million in 1988 pay and keep at least half of <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s pay and fire him if he is indicted. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said in an accompanying affidavit that the <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> provisions `` were initiated by the government and inserted in the plea agreement at the government's request.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> opposed the action but took them `` in order to reach an overall agreement with the government.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> would be willing to pay the <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION> if not for the pact. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said the government would have no comment on the filings. A hearing on the <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION>' motion is set for March 14. One week ago, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> filed a supporting affidavit for the government in the same case, admitting that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> `` entered into the plea agreement voluntarily and without coercion after consulting with counsel.'' The government has said the possibility of indictment on more serious charges does not constitute coercion and that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> was not threatened with RICO charges during negotiations. The <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION> are asking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Kimba </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> to reject or modify the settlement, under which <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to pay $ 650 million in fines and restitution and plead guilty to six felonies, because it violates the <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION>' rights. To show <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> was under contract with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, his attorney Tuesday submitted a 1975 agreement _ still in effect last year _ stating the high-yield `` junk'' bond trader is entitled to a minimum of 15 percent of any profits under $ 1 million to 35 percent of department profits over $ 8 million. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> is one of the biggest targets of a federal securities fraud crackdown and is expected to be indicted on fraud and racketeering charges. He was named in a civil suit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> last September but faces no criminal charges and has denied any wrongdoing. The criminal plea can not take effect until the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> settles civil charges with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. Negotiations are continuing.

<HEAD>Favorable Ruling In England Boosts High Voltage Takeover Hopes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A favorable ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> won praise from <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voltage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> but was dismissed as `` an interesting sidelight'' by the company's takeover target, <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> exchange decided Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Berisford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> food company financing High Voltage's $ 643 million, $ 35-a-share bid for Milwaukee-based <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, does not have to ask its shareholders to approve its role in the takeover. `` We're very excited,'' said <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Press </PERSON>, deputy chairman of High Voltage. Press said that, in light of the decision, <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voltage </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Berisford </ORGANIZATION> are considering changing a provision under which a change of ownership of High Voltage or <ORGANIZATION> Berisford </ORGANIZATION> would allow the other to purchase the stake in <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>. Press said the attempt to bring <ORGANIZATION> Berisford </ORGANIZATION> into the takeover action has been `` a complete sideshow, a desperate effort -LRB- by <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to avoid dealing with us. We're pleased it's been put to bed.'' But <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, a Universal Foods spokeswoman, discounted the impact of the <ORGANIZATION> Berisford </ORGANIZATION> decision. `` <ORGANIZATION> Berisford </ORGANIZATION>'s problem with its shareholders is an interesting sidelight,'' she said. `` But it's just that; it's peripheral to the issues being decided by Judge -LRB- <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> -RRB- Stadtmueller.'' She was referring to High Voltage's effort to get <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>' anti-takeover defenses overturned in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. High Voltage launched the takeover attempt for <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> in December. The <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, Mass.-based company is owned jointly by <ORGANIZATION> Berisford </ORGANIZATION> and two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investors. Universal Foods, seeking to have the High Voltage takeover attempt halted, has argued that <ORGANIZATION> Berisford </ORGANIZATION> failed to reveal its exact role in the takeover bid, in violation of the requirements of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> stock closed Tuesday at $ 34.75 a share, up $ 1.50, on volume of 514,800 shares. <ORGANIZATION> Berisford </ORGANIZATION> also said Tuesday that it hopes to renegotiate its partnership with <ORGANIZATION> Hyde </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Berisford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> own equal stakes in High Voltage. The decision to seek changes in the partnership accord was <ORGANIZATION> Berisford </ORGANIZATION>'s first public response to complaints from <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, which owns a 24 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Berisford </ORGANIZATION>. Associated British Foods argues that the partnership accord may constitute a so-called poison pill that would discourage any company considering a takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Berisford </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> also has sought to have <ORGANIZATION> Berisford </ORGANIZATION> submit details of its role in the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> bid for shareholder approval.

<HEAD>Time Stock Soars As Takeover Rumors Abound</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wall Street analysts have dismissed rumors that <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> might receive a takeover bid more lucrative than the media giant's planned $ 18 billion merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But investors were captivated by the idea of a possible outside offer, and bid Time stock up $ 9.25 a share Tuesday to $ 116.75 in heavy <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, rose 62 -LCB- cents to close at $ 48.87 -LCB-. Time has been the target of persistent takeover rumors, but the analysts rejected the latest talk and predicted the company's plans to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> through an exchange of stock would go through. `` It would be puzzling that anyone would necessarily -LRB- make a bid -RRB- now, because of the discount value -LRB- Time has -RRB- traded at for years,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kukowski </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` There's been a window of opportunity and no one did it before, so why do it now? <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said `` the odds are better than 50-50'' against a bid, partly because of the anti-takeover atmosphere in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after the late 1988 wave of multibillion-dollar leveraged buyouts. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration have suggested steps be taken to curb takeovers following the record $ 24.53 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Big buyouts financed through heavy borrowing, such as the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> deal, are seen as un-American, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said, while Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> `` are positioning the deal as pro-America and pro-business. `` If I read <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> correctly, they would prefer to see someone run the business and not break it up and lay off employees,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> say no jobs will be lost as a result of their merger, and that the combined company will be better able to compete with other international media giants. Although investors focused Tuesday on Time, they continued buying stock in other media companies, whose stock prices rose sharply Monday in industry-wide takeover speculation. <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, rose $ 1.25 to $ 47.12 -LCB- a share Tuesday, while <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 1.25 to close at $ 54.25. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which soared $ 6 on Monday, finished down $ 2.12 -LCB- at $ 170 on Tuesday. Other questions about the <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> merger lingered, such as the possible opposition of <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder When the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> board voted 12-0 with one abstention to approve the merger, <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> was the abstaining director, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> source who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, who has bickered with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> for years, has kept an uncharacteristically low profile since the <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> deal was announced. He did not return a reporter's telephone calls seeking comment on the merger Chris-Craft acquired its stake when it helped <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> fight an unwanted takeover by media giant <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> in 1984, but <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> tried to stop <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s recent acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In the past, he and <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> argued about the makeup of the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> board and the size of <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>' salary. But analysts, noting that <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>'s power will be diluted in the merger, said he wo n't be able to stop the deal. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> officials say <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>'s stake in the new company will decline to 6 percent to 7 percent from his current 11 percent <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> share, while the amount of shareholder votes he controls will drop to 14.2 percent from the 17 percent he controls at <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. Chris-Craft stock closed down 12 -LCB- cents a share at $ 33.37 -LCB- following a $ 3.75-a-share rise on Monday.

<HEAD>Critics Say Time Warner Merger Could Reduce Variety on Cable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The proposed merger of the media giant <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and entertainment producer <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> could lead to fewer programming choices on their huge cable system operations, critics say. Both companies own cable systems that are among the five largest in the nation. The combination would rank second behind the biggest cable operator, <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The proposed <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> combination could `` diminish the free flow of information,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Access </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, which describes itself as a public interest law firm. He said Tuesday that the combined cable operations may turn to the programming produced by sister businesses at <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> _ which has major movie and television production operations _ rather than buy it from independent producers. `` It will affect the prices paid for programming and the variety and diversity of programming that is available and impair the ability of other companies to come in and compete effectively,'' <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> division that is preparing to launch a new cable network, Consumer News and Business Channel, said the merger could make it tougher to get a big audience for <ORGANIZATION> CNBC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> said cable systems with 12.5 million subscribers already have signed up for <ORGANIZATION> CNBC </ORGANIZATION>, ahead of earlier projections for the service's launch. But he said Time has refused to put the service on its cable systems, adding that could be because <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> has the right to take over another cable service, <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, if <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s owner, <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is sold. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> is merged into Time, that is 5.5 million subscribers that are outside <ORGANIZATION> CNBC </ORGANIZATION> distribution,'' he said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Luftman </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said it was premature to speculate how the combination would affect programming choices. But he said that once the merger is completed, the cable systems will be run fairly autonomously even though one person will oversee both of them. <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, an analyst for the <ORGANIZATION> media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> firm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said the combined cable operation probably would be able to command a cheaper rate for programming than the systems paid as separate entities. She said there also may be economies of scale in combining some of their administrative operations. She said the combination extends a trend toward consolidation in the cable business, which has raised concerns that the operators, who have been freed from federal rate regulation, will boost their prices. Those fears were not borne out last year, the first year of full rate deregulation, when the average basic cable rate rose about 10 percent, down from a 19.7 percent rise the previous year, she said. Time owns 82 percent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. It is the second-biggest cable system operator, with about 4 million basic subscribers. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, has about 1.5 million basic subscribers and ranks fifth among operators. But a combined <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> cable company still would trail Denver-based <ORGANIZATION> TCI </ORGANIZATION>, which has about 9.7 million subscribers. That figure includes its share of subscribers to systems in which it has a part interest, <PERSON> Kagan </PERSON> said. Officials of Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> told securities analysts earlier this week that they anticipated no serious antitrust problems with their merger, which was announced Saturday. The merger requires stockholder approval. They said <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> may have to sell <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>'s cable system in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which has 30,000 subscribers, because of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s minority interest in <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns television station <ORGANIZATION> KCOP </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> The government prohibits companies from operating a television station and a cable system in the same market.

<HEAD>Checks Given To Ford Workers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Forty-two <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> employees got a little extra along with their profit-sharing checks _ a brief chat with the company's vice chairman. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> dropped by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s sprawling Rouge complex on Tuesday to hand out profit-sharing checks of about $ 2,800 apiece to workers at the <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> assembly and stamping plants. <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> chatted briefly with <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> employee for 16 years, who's been at the <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> assembly plant for 13 of them. `` I told him I was going to put it down on a new car,'' she said after talking with <PERSON> Poling </PERSON>. She said she has n't decided which car she would buy, but it definitely would be a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. A little further down the line, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hines </PERSON> got his check and told <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> it would go for his daughter's college tuition. <PERSON> Hines </PERSON>, 62, has been a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> employee for 35 years. And before heading to the line, <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> gave a check to <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, who's been working at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> assembly plant for 25 years. `` I already put it in a money market account,'' he said. `` I've always have put it in a money market. <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> said that if a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> employee had been around to collect all six profit-sharing checks the automaker has issued, the worker would have received about $ 12,200. `` Despite my reputation as a cost-cutter, I'm a strong believer in profit sharing, count on it,'' he said before his stroll by an assembly line on which new <ORGANIZATION> Mustangs </ORGANIZATION> rolled past. More than 152,000 workers received their checks Tuesday. The amount was the second-highest in auto industry history and far outpaced those of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which will distribute their profit-sharing checks later this month. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has said its typical worker will receive $ 254, while <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s average check will be about $ 720. Profit-sharing among each of the nation's Big Three automakers is based on financial performance in their North American operations. Profit for those activities must reach certain levels for profit-sharing to kick in. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> began distributing profit-sharing checks in early 1984, and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has continued every year since. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, which will mail this year's checks March 14 to about 450,000 hourly and salaried workers, had no profit-sharing payments in 1987 or 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will distribute its profit-sharing checks Friday to more than 82,000 hourly and salaried workers. The No. 3 automaker did n't begin profit-sharing payments until this year, but handed out $ 500 checks to employees in each of the past two years in lieu of profit sharing Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> provided about $ 3,700 per employee in profit-sharing, the largest in the five-year history of the payments by automakers. The lowest amount <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> workers have received was about $ 400 each in 1984. While some <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> employees celebrated this year's profit-sharing checks with dinners or long-planned purchases, others never will see the money. Last year, in an agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friend </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the company withheld profit-sharing checks for more than 2,300 employees who were behind more than $ 500 in child-support payments. For the most part, though, Tuesday was a happy day at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> factories. `` It makes the whole year worth it,'' said <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a quality upgrader at the <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> assembly plant.

<HEAD>Stocks Down On News Of New Scandal Arrests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s main index fell today after word of new arrests in a major stock-profiteering scandal, and the dollar fell against the Japanese yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 61.08 points Tuesday, fell 100.28 points, or 0.31 percent, closing at 31,837.66. After gains in early trading, news of the arrests discouraged investors, said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest brokerage. Prosecutors today arrested former <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, 58, for allegedly receiving bribes from the employment information conglomerate Recruit Co.. Former Recruit executive <PERSON> Masao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatsumi </PERSON>, 46, was arrested for allegedly offering bribes This brought to 12 the number of arrests in the case. The scandal, uncovered last fall, has shaken the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. Three Cabinet ministers, including Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitazawa </PERSON>, have resigned in connection with the affair. `` The news of Wednesday's arrests contributed to the downtrend because trading already was becoming unstable without incentives for buying,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> dealer said. `` Institutional investors, who have big influence on the direction of trading, lost buying interest, which caused the losses in the afternoon,'' said the dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity. Investors also were waiting for February's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figure, due to be announced Friday, the dealer added. In active trading, with sell orders outweighing buy orders, volume traded on the first section was estimated at 1.2 billion shares. On the foreign exchange market, the dollar ended at 128.73 yen, 0.30 yen lower than Tuesday's 129.03-yen finish. The dollar opened at 128.68 yen and ranged between 128.65 yen and 128.90 yen. `` The dollar-yen rate has hardly moved since around 10 a.m.,'' said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, also requesting anonymity. He also cited caution before announcement of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobless figures. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> told a news conference today that he did not see foreign exchange rates as likely to fluctuate widely, but added that the central bank was prepared to `` take appropriate measures'' if rates showed significant changes.

Dealers said they expected the dollar to trade within a narrow range for the rest of the day. `` It's purely a technical market today,'' said a trader at a major West German bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. `` The dollar is desperately searching for a trend, but ca n't find one.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.30 Japanese yen to a closing 128.73 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 128.55 yen.

 A federal judge on the bench less than three months has until Friday midnight to decide two questions that could determine the outcome of the Machinists' strike again Eastern. One question: Does the Machinists' right to picket railroads, including <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION>, mean the railroads' own employees have a right to observe those picket lines, even if their bosses order them to work? The other: What's the difference between trains and planes? Specifically, does the fact that this case involves two industries distinguish it from a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision involving two railroads? The man on the spot is <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. He was elevated to the bench Dec. 20. `` He's ruling in an arcane area of labor law, he's under rea time pressure, and he's going to have to make new law,'' says a management labor lawyer speaking on the condition of anonymity. `` This case is out at the edge of where the law is.'' `` This is arcane stuff even for labor lawyers and veteran judges,'' said another lawyer who spoke on the same terms. `` This judge has got some learning to do.'' In an apparent attempt to force federal intervention, the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> last week announced plans to picket railroad stations as part of their strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>. But on Sunday, <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> _ who was spending the weekend upstate at his country home, <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oaks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> _ issued an order that barred railroad union members from striking until 3 p.m. Wednesday, and set a hearing an hour earlier. On Tuesday, he extended his order until midnight Friday. The key decision to which <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> will be referring is <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Northern Railroad vs. Maintenance of Way Employees, in which the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the Railway Labor Act of 1926, which covers railroads and airlines, does not prohibit secondary strikes. Such strikes are prohibited in most industries by the Taft-Hartley Act. The railroads concede the Machinists' right to picket rail stations but argue that the railroads have the right to order their employees to cross those picket lines. The railroads' contracts with their unions do n't contain explicit no-strike clauses, which would override the unions' right to honor a secondary strike. But <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION>, says his commuter railroad's labor contracts contain `` an implicit no-strike pledge'' because they stipulate that all disputes be subject to arbitration. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, disputed that. He said that unless a labor contract specifically bars a secondary strike, it is a `` protected act'' under federal law. `` You either have the right or you do n't,'' said <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, who represents unions. `` I'm at a loss to explain the judge's decision'' to grant the restraining order. The importance of the second question _ Are airlines and railroads separate industries? _ stems from the fact that years ago, the fledgling airline unions got themselves covered by the Railway Labor Act. It subjects railroad workers to a separate body of labor law from other workers. In the <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Northern case, the court held that the Railway Act, by not mentioning secondary strikes or boycotts, implicitly permitted them. But that case involved several freight lines. Does the fact that this one involves an airline and several railroads significantly distinguish it? The cross-industry issue may be important for another reason. With some exceptions, including those outlined in the Taft-Hartley Act, federal courts lack jurisdiction to issue injunctions in labor disputes. But the law that established that principle, the Norris-La Guardia Act, established an exception of its own: cross-industry secondary strikes. That legislation reflected <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'s conviction that strikes should be economic battles, not political ones, and thus fought only by unions and companies in the same industry. Whether this applies to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> and company is for <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> to say.

<HEAD>Soviets Boosting Sales of Nuclear Fuel to American Utilities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Energy Department says growing Soviet sales of nuclear fuel to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electric utilities are costing the federal government hundreds of millions of dollars in lost business. Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the Soviets are grabbing customers by offering lower prices, and that erosion of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear fuel program by foreign competition posed a threat to national security. `` With excess capacity and a need for hard currency, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been receptive to opportunities to sell enriched uranium to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> utilities both directly and indirectly through brokers,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said in a written response to a variety of questions from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. A text of <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' responses was made available Tuesday at the committee's offices. As recently as 1974 the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was the only supplier of enriched uranium to nuclear power plants throughout the non-communist world. Last year the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of the world market had plummeted to about 45 percent, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. The Energy Department runs the country's uranium enrichment operations at plants in <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION>, Ky. These plants increase, or `` enrich,'' uranium-235 atoms beyond their natural concentration for use in nuclear reactors. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> uranium enrichment operations lost more than $ 170 million in sales over the past three years to the Soviets, who have made about 30 percent of their enrichment capacity available for foreign sales. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stands to lose another $ 1.7 billion to foreign competition over the next nine years, he said. `` Based on proprietary and government confidential commercial information, the department is concerned that sales of Soviet enrichment services to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> utilitie do in fact pose a very real threat to <PERSON> DOE </PERSON>'s market share,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> wrote. He said the Soviets had succeeded in grabbing new foreign sales of its enrichment services by offering prices as much as 50 percent below the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> price. He said about half the Soviet sales are made to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> utilities through brokerage firms. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> provided no further details about specific Soviet transactions with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> utilities. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was preparing a legislative proposal to create a government corporation that would take over the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s uranium enrichment operations in order to restore their competitiveness. `` The department does not have the flexibility or discretion to compete effectively in the tight world market which has developed,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said, adding that maintaining a healthy uranium enrichment business `` has important energy security and national security implications.'' The plants also supply enriched uranium for the government's defense nuclear reactors A 1985 <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> study attributed the loss of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dominance in nuclear fuel sales to concern in foreign countries about the reliability of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supplies. Many nations also objected to restrictions on nuclear fuel use that were enforced through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> enrichment contracts, the study said. Rep. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, D-Tenn., introduced a bill last month that would prohibit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> utilities from directly or indirectly purchasing Soviet enrichment services She expressed concern that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could become too dependent on the Soviets for nuclear fuel, posing a potential threat to national security. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> also said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is committed to completing a program designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new technology for enriching uranium. The technology, called the Advanced Vapor Laser Isotope Separation process, would allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to compete with the lower Soviet prices. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the department needed $ 500 million between 1989 and 1991 to complete the demonstration program. He said the process could be put into operation by 1996. The administration has requested $ 148 million for it for the coming budget year.

<HEAD>Committee Advances Bill to Push Bush on Eastern Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congressional Democrats are moving to force President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene in the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike, but spokesmen for the company say it may not survive long enough for the bill to pass. A subcommittee voted 21-12 Tuesday to advance the bill directing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to call a presidential emergency panel to mediate the strike, now in its fifth day. But <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Onstad </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, told the panel that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s survival is `` open to question'' if pilots continue to honor striking machinists' picket lines. The strike has stopped all but a few Eastern flights and caused the company to nearly shut down, laying off all but 1,500 of its nearly 11,000 nonunion employees. The battle pits <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> against Democrats and organized labor, which sent its top official, <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, to testify Tuesday in support of the bill to force the president to call an emergency panel to mediate. Creation of the panel would end the strike for up to 60 days. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> suggested that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s failure to act gets him off to a bad start with labor, but <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he would recommend a veto if the measure passes. The Public Works' aviation subcommittee voted to send the bill to the full committee which is expected to take it up on Thursday. House action is expected by the middle of next week. The bill also would have to pass the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. If the president vetoes it, a two-thirds vote of both houses would be required to override. Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the subcommittee, said after the subcommittee vote that the Eastern strike is the `` wrong issue for organized labor.'' He said the bill would have a rough ride in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where rules allow any opponent to tie it up. Even if it passes both houses, he said, there are not enough votes to reject a veto. `` Organized labor is almost certainly in a power struggle it will lose to the president,'' said <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>. All 19 voting Democrats on the subcommittee, along with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> Reps. <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Boehlert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, supported the bill which directs <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to call an emergency panel. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated his determination to let the machinists' union and Eastern settle the dispute without federal action. Although the Railway Labor Act gives a panel 30 days to mediate and imposes an additional 30-day cooling-off period, subcommittee Chairman Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., indicated he might support a shorter period for mediating the dispute <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON> said even if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoes the measure, it would send the message that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants the strike settled. The bill as passed by the committee also calls on the panel to mediate <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s negotiations with its pilots and flight attendants even though contract negotiations for them have not reached the same impasse as the machinists' dispute. `` We want to stick it all into the same bag, settle it all at once,'' said <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, an Eastern attorney told a federal judge the airline could not operate more than 48 to 72 hours without pilots. But the judge refused to compel pilots to return to work. <PERSON> Onstad </PERSON> told the congressional panel that if the airline had to pay the wages it was paying before the strike, that too could quickly kill Eastern. `` I do n't think Eastern has the cash to survive two weeks of a presidential emergency board,'' he said. Since the airline began bargaining with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, he said, it has reduced its demand for $ 200 million in wage reductions to $ 125 million. The union wants $ 50 million in raises. <PERSON> Onstad </PERSON> declined to say how much Eastern was losing as a result of the strike but he said losses totaled $ 1 million a day before Feb. 1 and had increased since then. He said, however, the airline could still continue operations if its pilots would return to work and agree to a plan that would increase their productivity by $ 64 million without cutting wages. He said the company could pick up between $ 190 million and $ 375 million in revenue from gradual recovery of the business it was losing and from planned programs to attract new passengers. That, he said, would be enough to avoid bankruptcy.

<HEAD>With Eastern Weakened, Pan Am Launches `Shuttle War'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pan Am marshaled its ammunition as the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike loomed: More planes. More free coffee. Crates of laminated luggage tags. Stacks of frequent-flier sign-up forms. And when the Machinist union walked, the Shuttle War was on. `` This just gives us a golden opportunity to get those <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> die-hard passengers,'' <PERSON> Perette </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> marketing director, said Tuesday. `` Hopefully they'll become loyalists to the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> shuttle.'' `` When <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> was struck in 1985 we did the same thing, going for their routes,'' shrugged Eastern's <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. `` It's a dog-eat-dog world.'' But the dogs were fighting over a particularly big bone this week: the immensely profitable <ORGANIZATION> Boston-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-Washington </ORGANIZATION> shuttle business, in which <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> are the only competitors. Eastern, after meeting just half its shuttle schedule Saturday and Sunday and 60 percent Monday, struggled to restore its presence Tuesday, throwing its strike-diminished work force into the effort. `` Fly Us With No Reservations,'' Eastern declared in full-page newspaper advertisements. Seeking to reassure time-pressed business travelers, the text pledged: `` Our No. 1 priority is to keep the shuttle flying.'' But ridership was low at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which has operated the shuttle for 27 years and made about $ 30 million on the service last year. Most of Tuesday's flights carried only 15 to 20 passengers, according to a company source who spoke on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, moving aggressively, reported as much as double its normal shuttle business. The <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> shuttle has grown since its inception in 1986 to about 5,000 passengers each weekday, or nearly half the market. Since Eastern's strike began Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> has doubled its rush hour service, put on a bigger airplane to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and aggressively promoted its frequent-flier program to shuttle passengers. It has gone so far as to laminate travelers' business cards into free luggage tags at its terminals. Airline analysts gave the effort its due. `` Pan Am has an open shot at this market right now,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> brokerage house. `` The hardest thing in any marketing business is to get somebody to try your product,'' <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> said. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> indeed is able to provide a good product, there's a good chance they'll be able to keep at least some of the additional traffic they've taken from Eastern.'' The problem may not be Eastern's for long: It is selling its shuttle for $ 365 million to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON>, president of the Trump Shuttle, said he was `` not the least bit worried'' about losses to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're not just taking over the Eastern shuttle. We are starting a new airline,'' said <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON>. `` So the condition of the Eastern shuttle at the time we close is really not material.'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s agreement with Eastern could be canceled in a case of `` material adverse change'' to the property, <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON> said. But no revenue level or market share was set, he said, adding, `` We are going to close this deal.'' Still, some analysts suggested that the strike, if it led to bankruptcy for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, could endanger the sale. And others simply said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> will be buying a tarnished property. `` It's just that instead of starting out as Number 1,'' said <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>, `` he may start as Number 2.''

<HEAD>Ex-Labor Official Arrested In Widening Stock Scandal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Authorities today arrested a former government vice minister on charges he took bribes from a Japanese conglomerate, the latest bombshell in a widening stock scandal that has tainted the highest echelons of power. The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prosecutors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> arrested <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, 58, the former vice minister of labor and the highest-ranking public official yet arrested in the scandal. <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> was charged with accepting bribes from <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, when he bought bargain-priced stocks in <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary. He allegedly earned about $ 56,000 in profits when he later sold the stock after the company went public and share prices skyrocketed. Prosecutors allege that <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, in return for the stock deal, influenced a ministry decision on publishing employment information that would benefit Recruit, an information conglomerate. Prosecutors today also arrested <PERSON> Masao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatsumi </PERSON>, 46, a Recruit executive, who they claimed conspired with Recruit's founder and former chairman, <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, in bribing <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>. The arrests brought to 12 the number of scandal-related arrests. <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> was apprehended Feb. 13 on bribery charges. Two minor Recruit Co. officials were released Tuesday and prosecutors have yet to decide whether charges will be formally filed against them. <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>'s arrest had been widely anticipated since prosecutors last month arrested <PERSON> Shigeru </PERSON> <PERSON> Kano </PERSON>, a junior officer to <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, on bribery charges. Prosecutors today also searched <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>'s residence in <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION> along with several Recruit branch offices in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The stock scandal, in which more than 150 politicians, public officials and business leaders were offered bargain shares in Recruit-Cosmos and earned handsome profits, has rocked the administration of Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> since last summer. Many politicians, including <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, have been linked to the widening scandal after it was revealed their aides had purchased thousands of the low-priced shares. Three Cabinet ministers, including Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>, have already stepped down after their involvement in the scandal was revealed. Meanwhile, opposition parties stalled deliberations in the Diet, the Japanese parliament, on the nation's budget and demanded the <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> administration resign en masse or summon <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> to the Diet for questioning on his involvement. `` Without <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> appearing in the Diet, we can not participate in the session,'' said <PERSON> Shun </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohide </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest opposition group. `` You must resign now, Mr. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> at a speech in northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on Tuesday night. `` If you ca n't resign en masse, you must dissolve the Diet and appeal to the confidence of the people by calling for an election.'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> repeatedly has called for political reform in efforts to leave the scandal behind, but almost daily developments have caused the administration's popularity to plunge in media polls. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that of 2,211 adults polled, just 21.3 percent said they supported the <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> administration, down 6.1 percentage points from a similar poll in January. The January poll's findings marked first time below 30 percent for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> since he became prime minister in November 1987.

Voting occurred Tuesday during a six-hour, closed-door meeting. `` We almost had a riot,'' said reporter <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who related that the anger was directed at union leadership for reaching the tentative contract just hours after union members voted to authorize a strike. <ORGANIZATION> Graphic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> negotiator <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabhorn </PERSON> was at times pelted with dog biscuits, said reporter <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>. When the company's final offer was described to employees, disenchanted workers urged negotiators to `` throw the bone back.'' `` It was a zoo,'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said. `` Our mission now is to continue to publish the bright, lively and reliable newspaper our readers and advertisers have come to expect,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> chief operating executive <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>. Reporter <PERSON> Alina </PERSON> <PERSON> Tugend </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> workers will receive wage increases of 5 percent effective immediately, 4 percent the second year of the contract and 5 percent the third year of the three-year pact. The contract also improved health benefits for families of employees. The union represents about 500 of the paper's 800 union members. The union had compared the pay scale at the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>, a money-losing operation for several years, to its sister paper in the <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>. Under the old contract, top-scale <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> reporters received $ 563 a week, compared to an $ 801 weekly salary paid to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s top reporters. The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>'s circulation is 235,000.

 Share prices were higher in calm dealings at midday Wednesday, as shares were boosted from the outset by a buy program. Dealers also noted strong buying in futures, which inspired a good deal of confidence in the overall cash market. `` People are obviously prepared to pay a high price because they believe we're on the way up,'' one dealer said. `` The market feels healthy,'' another market maker said. `` We've risen for the last six days on some not-so-good news so I think all we need is one moderately favorable development to kick us really higher.''

 `` Tired of the nine to five grind? See more of the world in a month than most people see in a lifetime,'' the help-wanted ad said. The job? Flight attendant at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Never mind that the nation's seventh-largest airline has furloughed 9,500 employees, grounded almost all of its flights and is teetering on the brink of ruin. Approximately 20 young men and women showed up at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel on a cold, snowy Tuesday to answer the ad that appeared in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. The Eastern official who did the interviewing, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, insisted the ad was not placed in anticipation of the strike that hit the airline Saturday. `` What we are doing is trying to fill the commitment we made in the newspaper ads, rather than lock the door. We had no idea we would be faced with this situation,'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said. Members of Local 533 of the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the flight attendants, scoffed at the claim. `` They're hiring scab flight attendants to replace us,'' said <PERSON> Teal </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, a stewardess with Eastern for five years, as she picketed outside the hotel. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer of the local, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> conducted similar interviews in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Sunday and Monday and in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Tuesday and planned to do so in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> today. `` We are meeting these people at every hotel,'' Ms. <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON> said. `` We have had great success in convincing people to turn away. We handed them a flier and told them about other airlines that were hiring flight attendants and would pay them more money, and we said please come back some day when things are better at Eastern.'' The pickets drew the support of Local 25 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union, which represents workers at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> hotel, where the interviews were held. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, executive secretary-treasurer of the local, said he telephoned <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, general manager of the hotel, Monday night and `` asked him to throw Eastern out of there.'' `` His response was that they had already rented the place, and they could n't legally get out of it, but that it was just that one morning, and he did not think they would be back,'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said. `` It is strange for a union company to hold a meeting of that nature in a union hotel,'' said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. `` It was a situation that they could have avoided. I do n't foresee it happening again.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Chatilovicz </PERSON>, labor counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he spoke with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s lawyers about the matter Tuesday. The job-seekers, meanwhile, were mostly oblivious to the furor over Eastern. `` I want a job,'' said a young woman who would identify herself only as <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. `` I really did n't know about the controversy that was going on.'' She said company interviewers did not talk to her about the union or tell her that people were being laid off. She also said she was not given encouragement that she would get a job. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an unemployed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> resident, said he was not aware that Eastern had been struck and was furloughing employees. He said he just wanted to work for an airline. `` We are not passing out applications,'' said <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>. `` We are just trying to get an idea of those individuals who would be interested in working for Eastern in the event that we had to do some replacement of flight attendants.''

I will be 60 next month, so I'm going home.'' <ORGANIZATION> PS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors named <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shortley </PERSON> as <PERSON> Barkley </PERSON>'s successor Shortly, 48, joined <ORGANIZATION> PSA </ORGANIZATION> in 1968 as controller and currently serves as executive vice president of the firm. <PERSON> Barkley </PERSON> will remain a member of the board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> PS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of its exeucitve committee. <ORGANIZATION> PS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> was the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> PSA </ORGANIZATION> until it sold the San Diego-based carrier to <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> last year. <ORGANIZATION> PS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> then emerged as a `` liquid investment company'' that is building one of the nation's largest travel networks as well as leasing aircraft and selling fuel to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines <PERSON> Barkley </PERSON> `` quietly led the company and kept it stable during the deregulation period,'' said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> PSA </ORGANIZATION> president who is now the vice president for commercial marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I'm happy for the calm, but it certainly is n't the same world'' as the heated days of cut-throat competition in the deregulated airline industry, <PERSON> Barkley </PERSON> said. `` It was a tough business to be in, but it was exciting and dramatic.'' The most difficult year in <ORGANIZATION> PSA </ORGANIZATION>'s history was 1978, the year that deregulation was announced, he said. A collision over <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> that year involving a PSA jet and a private plane killed 144 people, including 37 <ORGANIZATION> PSA </ORGANIZATION> employees. Fuel prices began to climb in 1978, prompting PSA to make the tough choice of buying a new fleet of aircraft for short flights to replace its gas-guzzling 727s.

 Tortellini, ravioli and manicotti will soon be added to the cookies, crackers and snacks sold by <ORGANIZATION> Keebler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> if the proposed buyout of a Toluca-based frozen pasta manufacturer goes through as planned. <ORGANIZATION> Keebler </ORGANIZATION> has signed a letter of intent to purchase <ORGANIZATION> Bernardi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> _ a family business which traces its roots to 1932 and a small restaurant run by the son of <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> immigrants. Today, <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON> employs about 120 people in the production of about 40 varieties of fresh and frozen pasta which it distributes nationally and in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` They are going through our books right now and we're supposed to close the deal in mid-April,'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON>, chief executive of the pasta company, said Tuesday. Terms of the proposed sale were not disclosed. `` But nothing is going to change here,'' <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON> said. `` It's going to be business as usual and everything will remain under the <LOCATION> Bernardi </LOCATION> label We will be a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Keebler </ORGANIZATION>, operated independently. My son, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>, and I are even going to continue to run it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Keebler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenblatt </PERSON>, at company headquarters in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Elmhurst </LOCATION>, said the purchase of <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON> was tentative and requires the approval of <ORGANIZATION> Keebler </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biscuits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -LRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- PLC of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Greenblatt </PERSON> said the acquisition would give <ORGANIZATION> Keebler </ORGANIZATION>, which ranks second to <LOCATION> Nabisco </LOCATION> with $ 1 billion annual sales of cookies, snacks and crackers, a foothold in the lucrative and growing pasta food market. `` I would n't say we're looking to get into frozen pasta,'' <PERSON> Greenblatt </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON>'s is a good fit with our current food service operations. And we have a frozen snack bread product so we're already into frozen foods. `` But this would be our first pasta operation.'' <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON>'s interest in the pasta business dates back to 1932 when his father, <PERSON> Nildo </PERSON> `` Mona'' <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON>, opened a restaurant in <LOCATION> Toluca </LOCATION>, a town of 1,500 located about 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON>, 58, joined his father in the restaurant and in 1969, he bought a machine that automatically makes the family specialty: tortellini. The machine allowed <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON> to replace five women who produced about 150 pounds of tortellini each week by hand _ production the machine could match in one day. <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON> began mass-production of the pasta in an old meat-packing plant and in 1980 entered the frozen-food business, marketing his product under his father's nickname `` <PERSON> Mona </PERSON>'s.'' Along with frozen tortellini, <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON>'s menu includes pre-cooked, filled pastas, such as ravioli and manicotti. Other items include lasagna and rotini and raw pastas such as egg noodles, fettuccine and gnocchi. The company also sells its own line of entrees with sauces. <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON> originally sold tortellini and other pasta primarily to area restaurants, school cafeterias and private institutions. `` Italian food and pasta has become extremely popular,'' <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON> said. `` In the last two years, the growth has been tremendous.''

 When biologist <PERSON> Abigale </PERSON> <PERSON> Alling </PERSON> steps inside an airlock, she'll begin a stay in what eventually will be a new world on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Starting late today, Ms. <PERSON> Alling </PERSON> is scheduled to live for five days inside a self-contained environment _ a completely closed ecosystem independent of the air, water and nutrients of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, which researchers call Biosphere I. Her five-day stay in the module is a precursor to a two-year stay in a larger and more complex version of the airlock, or Biosphere II. Project spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyhr </PERSON> said researchers hope Ms. <PERSON> Alling </PERSON>'s five days in the airlock will have no startling developments. In similar but shorter experiments, `` nothing dramatic happened, which is exactly what we wanted,'' she said. `` Nothing unusual goes on, and then that's normal.'' Ms. <PERSON> Alling </PERSON>, a 29-year-old design coordinator for the Biosphere II project, will be monitoring and studying the various systems that control the environment inside the sealed 15,000-cubic-foot glass-and-steel space-frame structure. Project managers on the outside will be doing the same. Ms. <PERSON> Alling </PERSON>'s heart and respiration rate and other vital signs also will be monitored during her five-day stay. `` I will be breathing air that is apart from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Water recycling will be apart from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. This is really a milestone,'' Ms. <PERSON> Alling </PERSON> said. The nearly 2.5-acre, 7-million-cubic-foot Biosphere II is under construction, and in September 1990, eight researchers called `` biospherians'' will be sealed inside for two years. The aim will be to see whether man can exist in a complex and evolving but completely enclosed world. Biosphere II will have seven separate environmental systems, including a tropical rain forest, marsh, and desert. About 3,800 plant and animal species are being selected for the project. `` Learning how to do a better job of stewardship of Biosphere I,'' will be the `` big payoff of Biosphere II,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> and a consultant on Biosphere II. Such global problems as air pollution, acid rain and the greenhouse effect would be some of the issues studied, he said. The $ 30 million Biosphere II project is being undertaken by <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biospheres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ventures </ORGANIZATION>, a private company funded largely by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>. There have been 2 -LCB- years of unmanned studies and a three-day manned study in the test module.

 The stock market was narrowly mixed today as traders awaited new government figures on the employment situation.

 <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock plunged nearly 14 percent in heavy trading after the personal computer software publisher announced it expects lower sales and profits for its third quarter, ending March 31. The stock sank $ 8.50 a share to $ 53.50 Tuesday and was the most actively traded over-the-counter issue, with more than 5 million shares changing hands. <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> blamed the lower forecast on delays in shipments and overstocking by key distributors. `` This came as a nasty surprise. We ca n't tell how serious it is yet,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendelson </PERSON>, a stock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> said, `` Customer demand for our broad range of products remains good,'' and better results are expected in the final quarter. <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, director of administration and investor relations for <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>, said investors overreacted. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitlow </PERSON>, a securities analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lotzgesell </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Ragen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MacKenzie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, agreed. `` None of this is a reflection of the company's position or its products,'' <PERSON> Whitlow </PERSON> said. In heavy over-the-counter trading, <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> was off $ 8 a share at $ 54 late in the session, a drop of nearly 13 percent. In a news release, <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> predicted third-quarter sales of $ 180 million to $ 200 million, down from the $ 200 million to $ 215 million expected by many market analysts. <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> had sales of $ 161.8 million for the third quarter of last year and profits of $ 37.3 million. The company said it expected profits for the current quarter `` to be somewhat less than a year ago.' Shipments of <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>'s new versions of its word-processing program, <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> Word 4.0 for Apple Macintosh and Word 5.0 for IBM-compatible computers, were delayed and strong demand caused the company to run out of stock for current versions of both, <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the new versions should be shipped next month. Overstocked distributors are reducing their inventories, and demand for other <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> products remains good, said <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>. `` The shipping of both new <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> Word versions and the inventory reductions will improve our results in the next quarter,'' he said.

 An affidavit filed in a case stemming from a $ 10 million attempted extortion of the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> shows stolen documents detailed company secrets for its spandex fiber. In the affidavit filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Special Agent <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Flagg </PERSON> said the documents ranged from `` blueprints for the construction of the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lycra </ORGANIZATION> manufacturing plants'' to the company's specific process for manufacturing the spandex fiber, `` including mixtures, formulas, pressures, operating temperatures, plant maintenance and all necessary related technology.'' In the affidavit, <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, who directs <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide Lycra business and helped develop the spandex fiber process, told <PERSON> Flagg </PERSON>, `` a knowledgeable individual or chemical company would be in a position to duplicate the Lycra manufacturing process'' if they had access to the documents. Lycra is primarily used in swimming suits, sportswear and stockings. Four former employees at the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lycra </ORGANIZATION> manufacturing plant in Mercedes, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, were arrested Feb. 28 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> after an aborted meeting at which they were to pick up the $ 10 million in exchange for more than 1,000 documents stolen from the plant. A fifth suspect, also a former employee, remained at large Tuesday. All are charged with attempted extortion and conspiracy to extort, according to Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Falgowski </PERSON>. If the suspects fight extradition, it could take up to two months to have them returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Falgowski </PERSON> said, adding, if they waive extradition, they could be in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> in about a week. The affidavit alleges <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Assa </PERSON>, a Mexican citizen who manufactures spandex in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, hired <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Skerianz </PERSON>, who in turn enticed three employees of the <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> plant to work for him. <PERSON> Skerianz </PERSON>, who worked for <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> 20 years ago, was among the Argentine nationals arrested last week. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON>, 36, former superintendent of Lycra operations, and <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Inigo </PERSON>, 39, former maintenance supervisor of Lycra production at the plant, were allegedly recruited by <PERSON> Skerianz </PERSON> and arrested last month. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Ines </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianchini </PERSON>, 39, former custodian of the technical records at the plant with access to the documents, was also arrested.

<HEAD>Texas' Largest McDonald's Opens at Houston's Galleria Area</HEAD>

 Another McDonald's is opening for business today but this one has the bragging rights of being the biggest in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> where customers can munch on a Big Mac and fries. What also sets this 10,000-square-foot, two-story restaurant apart from others is that patrons can monitor the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on an electronic ticker at the restaurant, receive telephone calls at their tables or fax their orders to pick-up through a double drive-thru. `` We're anticipating to do big business at this restaurant and we have every reason to believe it'll be the most successful ever opened,'' said <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, senior marketing manager for <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns and operates the new 156-seat restaurant in the Galleria business center. The hamburger palace is the first fast-food restaurant in the predominantly business area and was opened with the businessman's needs in mind, Ms. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said `` We're always looking into innovative ways to fill the needs of our customers and this is just one of those ways at the Galleria,'' she said. A McDonald's on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Wall Street has a ticker tape and a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> restaurant has telephones at tables, but the new <LOCATION> Galleria </LOCATION> restaurant is the only one to incorporate all the amenities, including the facsimile machine. What patrons will find at the new restaurant is an upscale interior of teal blue, mauve, gray, silver and black with marble accents instead of the bright red and yellow found at the other 134 <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurants in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` We are targeting the business people that work there by putting amenities in the store that appeal to them _ the ticker tape and telephones at selected tables. This way the businessman can continue to do work and eat their favorite McDonald's meal,'' she said. Aside from the usual menu of Big Macs and fries, the restaurant also will offer fruit-filled breakfast tortes, soup of the day, freshly baked chocolate chip cookies and a low-calorie whipped dessert. The new restaurant `` represents McDonald's largest investment in the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and it shows how we feel about <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. There's confidence here that <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> is rebounding,'' she said Despite the bragging rights as the biggest <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant in the state, the new restaurant will be minus a huge `` Golden Arches'' sign. McDonald's officials originally wanted to place the sign on a 42-foot pole near the building to attract motorists from nearby Interstate Loop 610, but the hamburger chain yielded to pressure from area businessmen who complained the sign was too big. And although the restaurant is the biggest <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, it's just a small fry when compared with the chain's largest outlet _ a 26,000-square-foot restaurant in <LOCATION> Vinita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, that spans the Will <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnpike </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Sale Of Coleco Explored</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors has authorized management to explore a sale of the toy company as a means of solving its financial problems, but no potential purchasers have been identified. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of the Avon, Conn.-based company, said the board took the action two weeks ago. The committee representing <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors in its bankruptcy case has also approved exploring a sale, <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Handel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, said no purchase offers have been received. He would n't say whether any talks with interested bidders have been held. Testifying in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said selling the company is an alternative to proceeding with the debt repayment plan <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> has proposed. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>, which filed in January for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, has proposed a plan for repaying some of its $ 540.3 million in debts. The creditors' committee is fighting the plan, saying it would give most creditors only 10 cents of every $ 1 <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> owes them <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Prudence </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> put off a decision until April 4 on <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s request for approval of the plan's disclosure statement, which explains how much the company is proposing to pay each group of creditors. <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>'s approval is needed before the plan can be sent to creditors for a vote, which is necessary before <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> can emerge from bankruptcy protection. <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>, saying <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> should n't be surprised that most creditors object so strongly to its plan, reminded those in the courtroom of a popular 1960s song called `` Wipe Out.'' `` That's exactly what the unsecured creditors perceive the plan offers them,'' the judge said. `` I ca n't think of another plan where I've seen the unsecured creditors so wholly wiped out as they are in this case.'' Many of those unsecured creditors are investors who own about $ 335 million in <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> bonds. The creditors' committee on Feb. 14 filed a lawsuit against <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlmutter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Marden </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financiers who are the only secured <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> creditors, meaning they are first in line for repayment. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization plan proposes that <PERSON> Perlmutter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marden </PERSON> be repaid with stock and cash worth $ 70 million of the $ 80 million they are owed, effectively giving them control of <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>. The lawsuit questions business dealings the two had with <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> in the past two years and claims the men owe the company $ 71 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> did something that <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON> did n't, and the oil company could wind up paying some $ 80 million for its artistic blunder. <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> used white Italian marble sheathing on the outside surface of its 80-story headquarters building in downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. But the marble has weakened over the years. So all 43,000 of them will be replaced with granite during a facelift that begins next month. `` Carrara marble, which is what's on the building, is beautiful,'' says <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> architect <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Netsch </PERSON>. `` Michelangelo used it. But <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON> did n't leave his work outside.'' The repair job could cost up to $ 80 million before its completion in three years, said <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, manager of engineering for <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION>. Stainless steel strapping was installed last year to hold the 350-pound marble panels in place, even though the clips that attach the slabs to the building have never failed, a company spokesman said. In late 1973, a winter storm caused a construction scaffold to hit a slab that fell and demolished a car, said the spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. But he said that was before the building opened in 1975, and no pieces have fallen since. `` We decided to bite the bullet rather than continue forever on a maintenance program,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said Monday of the replacement project. ` We decided to get it over with.'' The replacement granite has a salt-and-pepper look up close, but will be whiter than the marble when viewed from afar, he said. At 1,136 feet, the structure was the fourth tallest in the world when it was completed. It's still the tallest marble-faced building anywhere. The marble was hauled from near <LOCATION> Carrara </LOCATION> in north central <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> at the direction of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Swearingen </PERSON>, then company chairman, and his socially prominent wife, <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON>. Now the company says it was a blunder to use the marble, which has badly deteriorated over the past two decades. `` Tests show conclusively that many of the marble panels have lost strength and must utimately be replaced,'' said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. The old marble can not be reused in building construction and no decision has been made as to what to do with it once it's removed from the building. It's too weak for buildings and too warped for countertops. Until a buyer is found, the marble will be piled up outside the headquarters, said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. The granite comes from a quarry in Mt. Airy, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, which is one of the world's largest suppliers of gravestones. `` This granite is very strong and stable,'' said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. `` I wanted to make sure that 15 years from now someone does n't have to go through what I'm going through.''

 Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today that private industry, and not the government, must take the lead in developing high-definition television production in this country. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said HDTV sales in this country could reach $ 140 billion in the next 20 years and that the impact of <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> will go far beyond entertainment uses. He cited potential advances in education, retailing and the military and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must take a leading role in this developing industry. But the private sector should remain `` pre-eminent'' in this effort, he said, and any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds that are expended for research in HDTV should go to the domestic industry and not to foreign competitors. `` In my view the private sector must take the lead ... and we're the ones who will be getting the hindrances out of the way,'' he said He suggested the government role could include tax incentives and possible antitrust exemptions for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers of HDTV products. He said development of a government policy in this regard has the `` highest priority'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and that he expects to be able to make a recommendation to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the government role in the next two months. A private study released Tuesday said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must move aggressively into the new high-definition television and flat-screen display industries or lose more than 2 million jobs annually and suffer a $ 225 billion trade deficit in electronics by the year 2010. If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not compete effectively with the Japanese and other nations in the high-technology arena, the personal computer and semiconductor industries alone could have respective deficits of $ 114 billion and $ 76 billion early in the next century, the report from the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said. Its author, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, said: `` Our nation stands at a critical juncture. If we do not create a strong industrial base centered on development of HDTV and flat-display screen technology, it will not only weaken our industrial base, but also reduce the numbers of skilled jobs that are needed to make us more competitive.'' Proponents of HDTV claim it can provide motion picture-quality images on flat television or computer screens using digital components. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> expects to have an HDTV system in full operation by the mid-1990s, whereas the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> telecommunications industry has barely begun testing of HDTV technology. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is soliciting bids for companies to share in a $ 30 million HDTV research and development program. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said HDTV technology will improve the entire `` food chain'' in the electronics industry. `` HDTVs will be used in the home, as display screens for personal computers, and by the nation's businesses to improve controls over automated production in auto, steel and manufacturing plants, to integrate video and print media in newspapers, and for the collection and transmission of important medical results such as X-rays and computer tomographs,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. He said he based his study on findings recently released by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> AEA </ORGANIZATION> study, a `` strong'' scenario represents a case in which 50 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market for <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> is controlled by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. In a `` weak'' scenario only 10 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market would be controlled by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said that with a strong HDTV base the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personal computer industry would attain an estimated $ 176 billion in sales by 2010, in contrast to an expected $ 44 billion in sales with a weak HDTV sector. In the semiconductor industry, sales would be $ 99 billion in a strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> HDTV industry compared with $ 25 billion in a weak industry. The trade imbalance in electronics could range from an estimated surplus of $ 10 billion under a strong HDTV program to a $ 227 billion deficit with a weak HDTV program, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. In the employment area, the personal computer industry could have 588,000 employees in 2010 under a strong HDTV scenario, or 147,000 employees under a weak HDTV program, he said. In all related industries, including <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> receivers and VCRs, automated manufacturing equipment, personal computers and semiconductors, there could be nearly 1.1 million jobs under a strong scenario and 274,000 jobs under a weak program. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said spinoff employment from a strong HDTV program could create another 1.1 million jobs _ even more if flat-screen display technology is used extensively in retailing, education or in automobile assembly. The <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> is a labor-backed think tank based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 Grain and soybean futures prices were trading mostly lower this morning on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting slack demand and forecasts for milder weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>. Pressure on the soybean market also stemmed from lower cash prices domestically and lower values for soybean meal and oil on overseas markets. But analysts said losses in the soybean oil market were limited by perceptions that <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> may be in the market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean oil. The corn and wheat markets also declined amid slow export demand despite rumors of new Chinese or Soviet buying interest in wheat. An expected warm-up to springlike conditions in the nation's midsection also weighed on grain futures by reminding traders that spring planting and increased barge shipping are not far away In early trading, wheat was -LCB- cent to 1 cent lower with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.33 a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 -RCB- cents lower with March at $ 2.76 -LCB- a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent lower across the board with May at $ 2.13 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were -LCB- cent to 3 -RCB- cents lower with March at $ 7.60 -LCB- a bushel. Livestock and meat futures were narrowly mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were unchanged to .10 cent lower with April at 77.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent lower to .13 cent higher with March at 81.95 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent lower to .13 cent higher with April at 44 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .25 cent lower to .25 cent higher with March at 38.85 cents a pound. Cattle futures settled lower on Tuesday while pork futures advanced.

<HEAD>Pepsi Changes Plans To Run Madonna Ad On MTV</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> changed its plans to run its new two-minute commercial with pop star <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> last weekend after the cable network started running the singer's potentially controversial new music video, a source close to the soft drink maker confirmed Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> ad with <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, which was dubbed `` Make a Wish'' and included an abbreviated verision of her new song `` Like a Prayer,'' debuted last Thursday on what <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> said were top-rated television shows in 40 countries. The next day, the cable network <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> began running a separate music video designed to herald the launch of the singer's new song. The video shows <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> in a black slip, dancing among burning crosses and seeking refuge in a church where she kisses a statue of a saint who comes to life. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> had planned to run the two-minute ad last weekend on <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>, but withheld it while the video is running, according to the source who spoke on condition he not be identified. The source said the change in plans was motivated by a desire to avoid competing for attention with the video and not by worries about the controversy that could be stirred by the video. <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>, said the network has received no complaints about the video, which has been running since last Friday. <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'s record label, said the record company had received no complaints here about the video She said a state-run television network in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> delayed its plans to carry the video last weekend after a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> group objected to what it had heard may be in the video. But she said the network has since reviewed the video and plans to begin airing it within the next 10 days. <PERSON> Tod </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>, declined to comment on whether the <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> ad was withdrawn from <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> but said the company had not changed its overall ad campaign plans. He said those plans were to air the two-minute version of the commercial before the song was released and then air shorter versions of the two-minute ad after the singer's record had begun to rise on the record charts. The single of <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'s song was released earlier this week, and the album is due out later this month. <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> said he could not say when the shorter ads will begin appearing.

 Some of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest electronics concerns, and some of their biggest foreign competitors, have filed applications for start-up money from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to develop high-definition television technology, the Pentagon announced today. All told, 87 proposals for funding were properly filed before the Feb. 27 deadline and will be evaluated over the next few months, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We are gratified by the extremely strong response from industry,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON>. Fields, the deputy director for research of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> DARPA </ORGANIZATION>. `` Many of the proposals are of impressive quality and they demand a careful evaluation,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the first contract grants could be awarded as early as April. Roughly $ 30 million in government grants is being set aside for the research effort. Despite some scattered congressional and industry opposition, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced in January it would not bar foreign-owned companies from submitting requests for research funding. The department cited federal procurement rules that call for fair and open competition, and the fact that it is too early to assume that all of the necessary research andt to stay on the ground, but in this modern age that is impractical for many. ... The questions that must be asked and answered now are these: Should airlines be forced to retire their old ... airliners when they reach a certain age, rather than continue to repair them? What should be the criterion for an airliner's retirement? And does the aviation industry react quickly enough to correct the problems of aging aircraft once they become known? For years, the industry has argued that age alone is no reason to ground a plane permanently, provided it is properly inspected and maintained. But now ... airline engineers are correctly having second throughts. ... The awful reality is that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s tardiness actively contributes to the fear _ not to say the danger _ of airline travelers already alarmed by these midair calamities involving older aircraft. That has to change, and change quickly, before more lives are sacrificed to the truly worrisome combination of ignorance and procastination.

They are dead wrong, from an ethical as well as a political standpoint. One of the reasons for the huge proposed pay increase was to make it more palatable for lawmakers to stop padding their individual salaries with tens of thousands of dollars supplied to them by interest groups in the form of speaking fees. Such payments _ totaling more than $ 10 million a year _ are an insidious form of legalized bribery and congressional leaders acknowledged as much when they intiated steps to abolish speaking fees in exchange for the raise. ... The chairman of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new Commission on <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION>, retired federal judge <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkey </PERSON>, reflects the unsparing view of most voters: `` The practice -LRB- of speaking fees -RRB- is evil.'' Joining a host of other ethics-minded groups, the presidential panel has unanimously recommended that speaking fees and other outside payments from special interests be abolished, irrespective of the question of a congressional raise. This is the only step that will quell the voters' justifiable wrath.

<HEAD>Sponsor of Connecticut Ad Tax Proposal Rates Its Chances as Slim</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The chief sponsor of a bill that would impose the state's 7.5 percent sales tax on advertising says it has little chance of becoming law. But Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBella </PERSON> said he wants to keep all options open with the state facing huge deficits. `` There was n't much support for it, was there?'' <PERSON> DiBella </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hartford </LOCATION>, joked after a day-long hearing on the issue Tuesday. The proposal is not being given serious consideration as Democrats look for hundreds of millions of dollars to erase this year's deficit and balance next year's budget. <PERSON> DiBella </PERSON>, co-chairman of the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, estimates that such a levy would produce $ 120 million a year for the state. <PERSON> DiBella </PERSON> rejected arguments that the tax would hurt the economy, saying it would simply be passed on to customers in the form of higher prices for products, as most other taxes are. Under his proposal, newspapers, television stations and others accepting advertisements would collect the taxes from advertisers and pass them along to the state. <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> faces a $ 195 million deficit in the current year, and Democrat Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> has called for $ 737 million in new taxes to balance the 1989-90 budget taking effect July 1. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s tax package did n't include the advertising tax, but he said again Tuesday that he is willing to look at any proposal. If the tax is enacted, it would be the only one in the country. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> imposed an advertising tax in 1987, but it was repealed later that year after a storm of protest from retailers and the media. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> experience was repeatedly mentioned during Tuesday's hearing. The committee heard hours of testimony from scores of people on the proposal, and not one favored it. A committee vote on the proposal could come as early as Thursday. Most of those testifying said it would be self defeating and cost <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> jobs. They also said it would be difficult to administer and collect and would hurt new businesses competing for customers. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisch </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courant </ORGANIZATION> speaking on behalf of the 21-member <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, told the committee that `` advertising is the spark plug of the economy.'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, senior vice president for advertising for the May stores, including <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION>'s, said a tax on advertising `` will depress advertising and related sales and will result in a decrease in sales tax revenues. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> of the painters union in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, whose members paint billboards, said the tax would almost certainly result in layoffs. Typical of the media opponents was <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pape </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, editor and publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Waterbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and American. `` A tax on advertising would seriously and adversely affect the <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION> newspapers, the retailers and businesses which rely on us to present their merchandise and services to the public, and the public itself, which would receive a diminished amount of information on which to base its buying decisions,'' <PERSON> Pape </PERSON> said. `` Inevitably, sales tax receipts of the state will be reduced,'' he said.

<HEAD>Radioactive Leakage Formed Underground Pools, Newspaper Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three buildings at the Fernald uranium processing plant stand over previously undisclosed radioactive ponds, which may pose a threat to drinking water supplies, a newspaper reported today. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION>, which has operated the Feed Materials Production Center for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> since 1985, said efforts to address the problem have already begun. Plant memorandums from 1965 through 1968 indicate that up to five gallons a minute of uranium-bearing water mixed with nitric acid ate through brick flooring and drain systems of <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON>'s Plants 2 and 3 and the Pilot Plant, The <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported. The underground pools discovered beneath the three plants add to the problems of a production center already plagued by a 25,000-gallon radioactive pool under Plant 6 and six toxic and radioactive waste storage pits. The memos describing the leakage were discovered among thousands given by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to attorneys involved in a $ 300 million class-action lawsuit neighbors filed against <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON>. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON> team manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the information was not surprising. `` We've had general knowledge that the refinery -LRB- Plants 2 and 3 -RRB- dealt with many more liquids than Plant 6 did,'' he said. `` Plant 6 was kind of a surprise, because it did n't deal with many chemicals, so we had the feeling it was n't the only one.'' The danger of the underground pools is that the radioactivity could seep into drinking water supplies, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Reafsnyder </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s site manager at <ORGANIZATION> Fernald </ORGANIZATION>, said clay under the plant seems to have confined the contamination. He said there is a plan to drill wells to assess the environmental risk. <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON>, 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, processes uranium for the federal government's nuclear weapons program. <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have refused to close the 1,050-acre, 37-year-old plant, saying its operations do not endanger residents or the environment. But the department has begun a 10-year, $ 500 million cleanup and modernization effort. The plant is one of 16 nationally that produce nuclear materials for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>. Several other plants are in various states of shutdown while health and safety problems are investigated.

 The stock market headed higher today as traders awaited new government figures on the employment situation. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.83 to 2,300.54 by noontime on Wall Street.

Wall Streeters hope the data will show a slowing of economic growth, providing a favorable portent for the inflation outlook and a possible easing of upward pressure on interest rates. But evidence of that kind has been slow in coming for many months now, leaving many market participants leery of any surprises in the data.

 Three members of a prominent <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> broker group and another floor trader have been fined a total of $ 400,000 and suspended for up to one month following allegations of violating <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> rules, according to their lawyer. The Merc charged that the brokers prearranged trades to circumvent limits on trades among members of the same broker group. The violations occurred in the pit where futures contracts are traded on Eurodollars, attorney <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said today. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowrance </PERSON>, who resigned from the exchange's board of governors last month, was fined $ 200,000 and suspended for 30 days, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lowrance </PERSON> stepped down before an appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> disciplinary committee in the case. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothner </PERSON> received a $ 75,000 fine and a 10-day suspension. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> was fined $ 25,000 and barred from trading for five days. Floor trader <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, who was accused of serving an an intermediary in the violations, was fined $ 100,000 and suspended 30 days, according to Cole. The penalties were imposed in an agreement reached late Tuesday under which the brokers neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. Broker groups are teams of floor traders who fill public orders. They are legal, but have come under scrutiny by an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation into suspected fraudulent trading at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> and Cgation, he said. `` There is no doubt the fines were as high as they were because of the climate in which traders currently find themselves because of the federal investigation,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. Last June, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> was fined $ 1,000 for exceeding limitations on customer order filling in Eurodollar futures. <PERSON> Rothner </PERSON> was fined $ 1,000 for a similar violation in Eurodollar contracts in April 1988.

 Lawyers for striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> machinists argued today that a federal judge improperly barred railroad workers from honoring picket lines that could close down <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s commuter railroads. The order by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> `` violated the clear command of the Norris-LaGuardia Act,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrieri </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, lawyer for the machinists, told the 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. That law says federal courts can not issue injunctions in labor disputes, except in cross-industry secondary strikes. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> `` was wrong in enjoining unions from engaging in secondary boycotts,'' said <PERSON> Guerrieri </PERSON>. `` The unions are free to engage in a full range of secondary activities.'' <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> on Tuesday extended until midnight Friday his temporary orders barring strikes at <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s commuter railroads in sympathy with the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> walkout. He scheduled a hearing for today on whether to issue a long-term ban on sympathy strikes. An aide said the judge extended his temporary orders _ which would have expired at 3 p.m. today _ to allow himself time to rule. Before <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>'s hearing, the appeals court heard an appeal by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signalmen </ORGANIZATION> of his temporary order. The <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> has said it may set up picket lines at the railroads, and rail workers' unions have said they would honor such lines. That could severely disrupt rail transit. The unions asked the appeals court to consolidate the three lawsuits brought by the various railroads into one case and delay <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>'s restraining order or order him to throw it out. But <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plum </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commuter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, argued that their employees are required to honor their labor contract until they have exhausted all non-court remedies under federal railroad laws. `` Those contracts require people to come to work every day. That's a basic obligation,'' said Plum. <PERSON> Plum </PERSON> said that under the Railway Labor Act, `` The question is that they first had to go to -LRB- those procedures -RRB- before it was determined if they could honor picket lines.'' Appeals court Judge <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> noted, `` Whatever we do, really, is meanigless because you're going to right to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> _ either side _ wo n't they?'' Plum conceded the parties probably would `` given what is at stake.'' The appeals panel, which included judges <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardamone </PERSON> as well as <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, said it would issue a decision later today. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> LIRR </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> sought and won the temporary orders from <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> forbidding walkouts.

<HEAD>Witnesses Call for Changes in Crop Insurance</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, a witness at the first of 15 hearings on the federal crop insurance program, said the program is wasteful and fails to provide farmers with fair and equitable protection. `` Our country is in tough times right now,'' the congressman said Tuesday. `` We're looking for a decade of economic stagnation. Our debt of $ 2.8 trillion and our interest payments ... have gotten us in such a situation that we must not waste dollars. The bureaucratic way in which the federal crop insurance group was put together causes us to waste a lot of federal dollars. We need to refine that.'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, a Democrat who represents <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s largely rural 3rd District, was among 27 witnesses who lined up to testify before the Commission for the Improvement of the Federal Crop Insurance Program. The 25-member commission, created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to protect more farmers from droughts and other disasters, will hold hearings in 14 states. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> noted that crop insurance reform has the backing of key <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> lawmakers, including Sens. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wyche </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, and said he is optimistic such legislation could win congressional approval. <PERSON> Kellye </PERSON> <PERSON> Eversole </PERSON>, the commission's executive director, said 50 crops, including peanuts, tobacco, soybeans and peaches, are eligible for crop insurance. Growers can select policies that cover 50 percent, 65 percent or 75 percent of their average yields. Ms. <PERSON> Eversole </PERSON> said concern about the nation's record budget deficit could mean farmers will have to rely more heavily on crop insurance, rather than disaster payments. `` We're trying to find out what is wrong with the crop insurance program and why participation is so low,'' she said, noting just 17 percent to 27 percent of the nation's farmers opt for crop coverage. <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peanut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said the two chief objections of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s 10,500 peanut growers is that crop insurance penalizes growers who have had low yields because of disasters and forces growers to insure all of their crops, rather than acreage that faces the greatest risk. `` The risks in farming are great, and government rules and regulations are constantly changing,'' he said. `` These factors have led to higher costs of production and low prices. We believe it is extremely important to ... help farmers bear the unpredictable risks of farming.'' <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Deal </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Statesboro </LOCATION>, said his bank requires borrowers to have crop insurance on at least some of their crops. `` In many instances we will have insurance only on peanuts or in some cases tobacco,'' he said. `` Only a small percentage of our farmers carry federal crop insurance on corn, wheat, soybeans or cotton. Their reasoning is that the premium is too high for the dollar amount of coverage they receive.'' Another banker, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Way </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Planters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hawkinsville </LOCATION>, said banks may decide to grant fewer agricultural loans unless the crop insurance program is improved.

<HEAD>Norway's Economic Cure Working Despite Side Effects, Bank Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Norwegian state bank said Wednesday the country's economic health appears to be improving following tough government measures but that rising unemployment is a worse-than-expected side effect. `` There has been signficant progress,'' <ORGANIZATION> Norges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said in its quarterly report Wednesday. The central bank praised recent negotiated and legislated wage limits but said unemployment, which doubled in one year to 3.9 percent in February, was higher than expected. Another 2 percent of the jobless were employed in extraordinary government programs. `` There is no simple way to reduce unemployment, but it is vital that the measures used do not undermine efforts to turn the Norwegian economy around,'' said the report. <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Hermod </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaanland </PERSON> said he did not foresee a prompt decline in unemployment but that state intervention will probably not overstimulate domestic demand. Income from <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil fields, now pumping 1.44 million barrels per day, plummeted with the 1986 oil price collapse, at the peak of a domestic spending and borrowing spree. Such earlier measures as interest rate hikes and legislated wage limits, now extended to March 31, 1990, helped turn <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s trade deficit into a January surplus of 3.7 billion kroner, or $ 552 million, and reduce 1988 consumer spending by 1.6 percent.

Both <PERSON> Beeksma </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, asked senators to phase in the stricter capital standards over five years, instead of two, arguing that most institutions could meet the standard over time. `` The current timetable ... is totally unrealistic,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mary-Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Meany </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, called the league's proposal to make commercial banks pay for <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L problems `` a deadly prescription for a dangerous disease.'' `` They seem crazy with desperation,'' she said. `` Their backs are against the wall and they're not thinking straight.'' The bankers group supports the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., said S & amp; L groups, by asking for more time on the capital standards, `` invite us ... by ignoring the lessons of history, to relive it. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, D-Nev., characterized the industry's position as `` let's have business as usual. Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON>, D-Ala., saying the league had in the past tried to play down <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls' poor condition, told the lobbyists, `` You have no credibility here today. `` I'm sure you all have lots of friends here, but less than you used to,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. However, Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, said he would press for provisions to ease capital requirements for smaller savings and loans, such as those in his state. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last month proposed spending about $ 150 billion over 10 years _ half of it from taxpayers _ to close or sell insolvent S & amp; Ls. He also would restructure the regulatory system by giving the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> control over the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Critics have charged the industry with exerting too much influence over the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L agency. The league, but not the national council, opposes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s effort to exert greater administration control over <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulators. Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, the senior Republican on the committee, said industry influence on regulators could be reduced without turning over control to what he called `` the gnomes of <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>.''

 The stock market staged a rally today as traders awaited new government figures on the employment situation. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 18.58 to 2,309.29 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 798 up, 533 down and 566 unchanged. Analysts said investors were growing more optimistic awaiting the employment report for February from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. Wall Streeters hope the data will show a slowing of economic growth, providing a favorable portent for the inflation outlook and a possible easing of upward pressure on interest rates.

The average made a run past 2,300 on Tuesday but then fall back. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> slipped -LCB- to 116 \ after jumping 9 \ points on The big gain was attributed to speculation that the company, in reaching its weekend agreement to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, might have opened itself up to a takeover bid from some other direction.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> today endured the fifth day of its Machinists strike with a major court defeat that keeps its pilots out of its planes, but a federal appeals court refused to allow sympathy strikes at commuter railroads in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area. The pilots' union said its members at other airlines would follow all safety rules to the letter again today, at whatever cost in service delays. The clearest effect on travel, however, was at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which was forced to lay off 9,500 employees this week and ground most flights because of pilots' support of the 8,500-member <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union strike over <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s demand for contract concessions. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> denied <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s request for a temporary injunction forcing the airline's 3,600 pilots to return to work, despite warnings from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s attorney that the company faced imminent bankruptcy proceedings if pilots were n't forced to cross picket lines The airline flew just 57 flights of its Northeast Shuttle on Tuesday, and 41 flights were used to return stranded planes to home bases from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and other points, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said today. Before the strike, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had more than 1,000 flights daily. Eastern, which has only 1,500 employees of a pre-strike work force of 31,200 still working and contends it has `` no business on the books,'' said it planned to file an appeal this afternoon with the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the option to file for protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy laws remains `` a course of last resort.'' However, some union leaders have contended that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> owner <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has planned all along to tear the carrier apart. `` Mr. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has obviously not got the trust and confidence of his company. A company does n't work unless it's a team,'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said today on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` This Morning.'' `` Congress ca n't get involved and the president ca n't get involved. You do n't create a working relationship between a company and its employees by congressional act and you ca n't keep letting the situation deteriorate,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. The pilots union reported that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management called its negotiators Tuesday evening to try to set up new talks for their contract, which expired in June 1988. Union spokesman <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said today that the contact `` was just a telephone conversation, a contact. We're officially supposed to meet March 9.'' The ruling in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, is `` a victory for labor in general,'' Eastern pilots' leader <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON> told a raucous rally of nearly 3,000 striking employees gathered downtown Tuesday night for a teleconference beamed by satellite to 11 other groups across the country. `` All of us or none of us!'' chanted the crowd of strikers who jammed <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s Knight Center. Earlier, about 200 non-union workers, most of them among those laid off this week, demonstrated on company property across from pickets, shouting `` We want our pilots back!'' About 60 percent of the 40,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday followed its request that rule books be stringently observed, said Capt. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, a union spokesman. The job action began Tuesday and could cause major flight delays around the country, but <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said, `` the reports we have are that there has been no effect on operations.'' There were minor delays in arrivals at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this morning that might have been caused by a pilots' slowdown, said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. This morning, no major delays were reported at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` There have been sporadic requests for special handling by flight crews,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mort </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>. `` The number is very few. ... It has n't disrupted the system.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, refused to budge from his opposition to government intervention to halt the walkout that the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, representing mechanics and ramp service workers, began Saturday. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel, however, approved a bill that would compel <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appoint an emergency board to study the 17-month contract dispute and issue a recommendation. The action would include a cooling-off period of up to 60 days in which striking employees would return to work. Pilot leaders were trying to get support for the bill, which is not expected to reach the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor before next week. Lawmakers concede there are not enough votes in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to override an expected presidential veto. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters the strike at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's seventh-largest airline, should be settled through bargaining And the president said if the Machinists try to shut down rail service later this week, he will ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ban such secondary boycotts. Secondary boycotts, particularly in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan area, could disrupt commutes for hundreds of thousands of people. Unions representing workers at three suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> rail lines have appealed a federal judge's order issued last weekend barring them from honoring any Machinist picket lines set up at railways. The judge has extended his order, originally set to expire this afternoon, through Friday. A three-judge panel of the <ORGANIZATION> 2nd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> heard arguments this morning and later refused to lift an order barring commuter railroad workers in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area from honoring any picket lines set up by striking Machinists. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> `` was wrong in enjoining unions from engaging in secondary boycotts,'' said Machinists lawyer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrieri </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` The unions are free to engage in a full range of secondary activities.'' Appeals court Judge <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> noted, `` Whatever we do, really, is meaningless because you're going right to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> _ either side _ wo n't they?'' The lawyer for two of the railroads conceded that was likely. Eastern, which carried 100,000 passengers on 1,040 flights daily before the strike, has continued operating only its shuttle between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and three round trips weekly between <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. The airline wants $ 150 million in concessions; the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> want $ 50 million in raises. Eastern has said it lost more than $ 1 billion this decade and $ 1 million a day before the strike.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar ended slightly higher after drifting without direction in dull European trading Wednesday, with the market lacking any fresh news on which to trade. Gold prices rose. `` The market is slightly favorable toward the dollar, but there is a lack of conviction over what extent the dollar should rise,'' one <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealer said. Another <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealer said: `` No one knows what's going to happen next. There's an equal spread of people who think the dollar will rise and those who think it will fall.'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.7200 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.7220 late Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's rates included: 1.8585 West German marks, up from 1.8520; 1.5865 Swiss francs, up from 1.5847; 6.3080 French francs, up from 6.3000; 2.0930 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0945; 1,362.20 Italian lire, down from 1,362.37; and, 1.20155 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1985 In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.30 Japanese yen to a closing 128.73 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it also was quoted at 128.73 yen. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 393.80 a troy ounce, compared with $ 391.45 bid late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid of $ 394.75 compared with $ 390.90 bid late Tuesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 4.74 to close at a bid of $ 388.21. Silver bullion prices rose on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market where the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 5.91 a troy ounce, compared with $ 5.88 bid late Tuesday.

 Consolidated Oil and <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, recently taken over by a group of disgruntled investors, has filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court for the District of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. In its filing Tuesday, Consolidated listed assets of $ 38.6 million and liabilities of $ 51.5 million. The company has been under financial pressure in recent years because of slumping oil and gas prices. In 1987, it reported a $ 9.3 million loss, compared with a loss of $ 21.5 million the previous year. A group of investors headed by <ORGANIZATION> Maryland-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and Texas-based Investment Limited Partners reacted by launching a proxy fight for control of the company. The investors captured control of Consolidated late last year, ousting existing management, including founder and chairman <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trueblood </PERSON>. During the takeover bid, the investor group accused <PERSON> Trueblood </PERSON> and the company's board of directors of milking the Consolidated assets for their benefit.

<HEAD>Soybeans Break Sharply On Farmer Selling, Brazil Harvest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices closed sharply lower Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as speculators were unnerved by the looming Brazilian harvest and an increase in farmer selling. Grain futures fell in sympathy with soybeans. Soybean growers in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the world's second-largest producer after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, are preparing to harvest their largest crop ever. The movement of Brazilian _ and then Argentine _ soybeans into the global pipeline will help ease the supply tightness that has contributed to the market's recent firm tone. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has estimated <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s 1988-89 soybean crop at 20 million metric tons compared with 17.8 million the previous year. On Wednesday, a widely watched private weather service raised its Brazilian soybean estimate to 20.7 million metric tons from 19.6 million. `` I think the real qustion is not whether it's going to be a record, but how much of a record,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, a grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> said a rise in soybean prices over the past 10 days had prompted more selling of stockpiled beans by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers. At the close, wheat was 1 -RCB- cents to 4 cents lower with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.30 a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent to 2 -RCB- cents lower with March at $ 2.75 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 5 cents lower with March at $ 2.05 a bushel; soybeans were 4 -LCB- cents to 11 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 7.56 a bushel.

 Some <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilots are n't as quick as fellow strikers to vilify boss <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> with shrieked epithets and shredded effigies _ they want to reach him through Christian dialogue and the Scriptures. A group of pilots and other employees at strike-torn Eastern are praying that `` someone sends Christian witness to <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuhrman </PERSON>, who has flown for Eastern for 16 years. `` We need some dignity; we need our voices to be heard,'' <PERSON> Fuhrman </PERSON> told a reporter as he stood on a picket line Tuesday in the empty Eastern terminal at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s sprawling <LOCATION> Hartsfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fuhrman </PERSON>, 43, said there are about 1,000 members in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Fellowship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION>, including about 100 pilots The other members include <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants, mechanics, baggage handlers and ticket agents. Many angry <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers have screamed `` Down with <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>!'' on airport picket lines up and down the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. On the first night of the walkout, strikers outside the airline's <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> office tore up <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> effigies and held placards reading: `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>: We are Your Worst Nightmare!'' <PERSON> Fuhrman </PERSON> has a quieter message for the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>: `` Mr. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, I hope that you know the love of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> and if you do n't, I hope that the Holy Spirit guides you to knowing the love of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> We pray that if we can find that common bond and we can stand in God's love and wisdom, we can run <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` We need the dignity and we need the respect and we need your love, Mr. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>.''

 Grand Metropolitan PLC, the British food and liquor concern that acquired <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, announced Wednesday the sale of the company's Steak and Ale and <PERSON> Bennigan </PERSON>'s restaurant chains to a management-led investor group for $ 431 million. Grand Met said the investors included senior management of the operating company for the two Dallas-based chains, S & amp; A <ORGANIZATION> Restaurant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and DJS-Inverness and <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based private investment partnership. Financing for the deal is to be provided by <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and other sources, Grand Met said in a statement. Grand Met announced its intention to sell <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; A in January, after the British conglomerate acquired <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> for $ 5.7 billion, because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> laws prohibit liquor companies from owning outlets which sell alcoholic beverages. Grand Met's businesses include liquor distilling. Wednesday's announcement followed a move Monday in which Grand Met said it would lay off 550 of the 2,350 employees in <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> headquarters, citing an `` overlap of functions'' and desire to streamline the company The layoffs affected all job classifications, from clerical support employees to managerial and staff-level functions. Last week, Grand Met announced it had eliminated <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s affirmative action office and created two new units, Grand Metropolitan Foods <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, to aid international expansion of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s food brands <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> and a Grand Met director, said proceeds from the restaurant sale would be invested in the growth of its <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> and Burger King units `` to enhance our shareholders' investment.'' `` We received several expressions of interest,'' he said, but the deal from the investor-led group was the only one to be `` clearly in the best interests of the <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Met </ORGANIZATION> shareholders and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; A employees.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON>, an analyst at the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Hopwood </PERSON>, said the sale should have positive effects for <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>. `` The long-term winner is obviously Burger King,'' he said. In the year ended May 31, S & amp; A had operating income of $ 50 million on sales of $ 716 million. It employs about 33,000 people with 159 Steak and Ale outlets in 24 states and 221 <PERSON> Bennigan </PERSON>'s in 32 states. Grand Met is a real estate, liquor and gambling conglomerate. Its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> holdings include <PERSON> Alpo </PERSON> dog food and <ORGANIZATION> Pearle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION>, and its liquor brands include Smirnoff vodka and J & amp; B scotch. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> makes <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> flour, <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> vegetables, <PERSON> Haagen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dazs </PERSON> ice cream and a variety of other products.

<HEAD>Rising Car Inventories And Strong Production, Can They Mix?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers are likely to relay more on sales incentives than on production cuts to reduce swollen inventories of unsold cars, analysts say. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have been maintaining production levels that have led to a big rise in the number of automobiles on hand. The authoritative <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s Automotive Reports said that at the end of January, there was an 85-day supply of of cars made by U.S.-based companies in inventory, up from 67 days at the end of December. Although incentives tend to cut into the automakers' profits, they are more appealing to customers and autoworkers, who want to keep production high. `` It's becoming increasingly clear that if you can maintain production volumes at a fairly steady pace, it's easier to control raw materials, your work force is happy and, ultimately, your warranty costs come down,'' said analyst <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirnan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I think they're going to hesitate on the -LRB- cutting -RRB- production route as long as possible and rely heavily on incentives,'' <PERSON> Kirnan </PERSON> said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s inventory was reported at 95 days, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s at 80 days and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s was at 89 days, the weekly journal said. Higher inventories early in the year are n't particularly worrisome to automakers, since January and February sales typically are slower than other months and companies sometimes build up their supplies before the usual spring sales rush. However, there is some concern on Wall Street. `` To the extent that inventory stays up and sales go down, something has to give,'' said analyst <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Verschell </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` Eventually, there will have to be an adjustment, cut production or increase incentive programs.'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has done both. Earlier this week, the nation's No. 1 automaker extended some existing incentives into April and May and created new ones in an effort to lure buyers to dealers' showrooms. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> doubled a two-week shutdown of its <LOCATION> Doraville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Oldsmobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cutlass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> assembly plant because, as plant manager <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said, `` We've got too many cars out in the field.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> did not immediately match <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s new incentives, but its existing enticements have no time limits. On the same day <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> issued its new incentives, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> said his company would remain competitive with other car makers' marketing schemes. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> is in better shape. For months, the No. 2 automaker has been producing more than 15 percent of its vehicles on overtime, meaning <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> can withstand a sales slump and still remain at full production. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, meantime, has been struggling in sales as a number of its factories change over to new models or begin `` ramping up'' production of newly introduced cars. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON> said the Big Three would be tested this month, when sales are expected to rise from January and February levels amid continued reliance on incentives. Car sales by the Big Three are down 10.6 percent during the first two months of this year compared with January and February of 1988. February car sales for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> were 14.4 percent below the pace for the same month last year. Verschell and <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> wondered whether the usual spring buying surge would be enough to shrink inventories to levels easing pressure to boost incentives or cut production `` There are just so many cars out there fighting for the same consumer,'' <PERSON> Verschell </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think it's going to be enough to reduce it,'' <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Kirnan </PERSON> was more bullish about spring sales, saying, `` The inventory problem will probably disappear by late March and early April, and production schedules are probably going to be maintained for the second and third quarter. `` I just do n't the,'' <PERSON> Kirnan </PERSON> added. `` I think thee degree that some people believe,'' <PERSON> Kirnan </PERSON> added. `` I think the traditional types of incentives are going to continue to do some magic.''

<TEXT>
 Energy futures prices rose Wednesday, driven by market rumors and technical factors. The April contract for the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, settled 24 cents higher at $ 18.54 a barrel, regaining some of the ground lost Tuesday when the contract fell 37 cents on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the April contract for wholesale home heating oil settled 0.29 cent higher at 51.37 cents a gallon, after falling 0.35 cent the previous session. April unleaded gasoline, which lost 0.18 cent on Tuesday, rose 0.44 cent to 51.85 cents a gallon. `` Having settled on a sour note Tuesday night ... the market has really turned around,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Some of incentive for the turnaround came from reports circulating in the market of a conflict between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Before details of the reported conflict filtered fully through the market, energy futures rallied temporarily with dealers buying in speculation that tensions between the two <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> countries might cause supply disruptions. The buying lost momentum once it became clear in the market that the conflict referred to an incident that occurred in mid-February. But at the same time, the rally drove crude past technical price thresholds that triggered more buying, <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON> said.

 The dollar strengthened Wednesday against all major currencies in moderate trading as some traders concluded that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was showing flexibility on a tax increase to reduce the federal budget deficit. Gold prices declined after rising overseas. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 391.90 a troy ounce of gold around 4 p.m. EST, down $ 1 from Tuesday's late bid. Currency dealers attributed the dollar's rally Wednesday to a report quoting <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, chairman of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, as saying the administration `` has not ruled out a discussion'' of taxes as part of a formal budget negotiation. <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> also said the administration has not abandoned its opposition to higher taxes. His statements were consistent with those of other administration officials in recent weeks. Nevertheless, the market chose to interpret <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>'s testimony as good news for the dollar. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, senior currency trader for <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is now conceding that he may allow higher taxes.'' Dealers said there were reports of the Federal Reserve selling small amounts of dollars to stem its rise Wednesday but that most market participants saw that intervention as more symbolic. `` I think they just wanted to remind us that they were still out there,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.30 Japanese yen to a closing 128.73 yen. It also was quoted at 128.73 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and later, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it rose to 129.225 yen from 128.825 yen Tuesday.

<HEAD>Mexico Said Seeking To Slash Foreign Debt Payments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ISAAC A. LEVI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has told the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> it aims to slash payments on its huge foreign debt to get its stagnant economy growing again, two leading newspapers said Wednesday. The privately owned <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiero </ORGANIZATION> and the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> said President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s administration informed the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> in a draft-letter of intent that it plans to reduce payments to 2 percent from 5 percent of the annual gross national product over the next three years. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Financiero </PERSON> said the letter was drafted after an <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> team visited <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> last week to evaluate an application for $ 500 million in `` special drawing rights'' to bolster the country's foreign currency reserves Special drawing rights, or SDRs, are a type of international money created by the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> for use in settling international payment imbalances. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> toured <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s principal creditor nations in February, unsucessfully seeking $ 100 million in fresh loans from private banks, together with a reduction in the paper value of the country's debt. Quoting unnamed government sources, the two newspapers said the debt situation was analyzed by <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> and other members of the cabinet's economic team at a meeting with <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> Tuesday night. Government spokesmen refused to talk about the debt situation. `` In due time, we shall make the appropriate information public,'' <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> replied in a telephone interview Wednesday. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> wants to use money saved on debt payments to spur economic growth to about 4.5 percent annually, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Nacional </PERSON> said. After two decades of 6 percent growth, the economy completely stagnated under <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' predecessor, President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, in part due to an austerity program put into effect to keep up with debt payments. Despite efforts to encourage non-petroleum exports, reduce government deficit spending and cut inflation, the economy has remained in the doldrums. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> _ de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s budget secretary _ has been warning since he took office in December that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> may be forced to suspend debt payments if it fails to wrest timely concessions from foreign creditors. Officials have been saying <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> wants to cut its annual service costs by about $ 7 billion from the $ 14 billion in principal and interest paid last year and the $ 16 billion scheduled for 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> estimates <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s debt was $ 106 billion in December. Deputy Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurria </PERSON> on Tuesday denied the debt had gone up to $ 108 billion and said it was actually on $ 100 billion. <PERSON> Gurria </PERSON> said in a television interview that the public sector foreign debt currently stands at $ 81 billion, the short-term inter-bank debt at $ 7 billion, the private sector debt at $ 7 billion, and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> is owed another $ 5 billion. El Financiero quoted the eight-page letter to the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> as saying the `` present -LRB- debt -RRB- situation is not acceptable or sustainable'' and `` it is urgent the Mexican economy start growing again'' in order to check growing unemployment. From 1982 to 1988 the economy failed to grow, per capita income dropped some 15 to 20 percent, the purchasing power of wages was halved, the newspaper quoted the letter as saying. The letter said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> needs to create 1 million jobs annually just to take care of new entries in the job market, but created only 1 million jobs over the six-year period. On the positive side, the letter noted that inflation was reduced from 159 percent in 1987 to 52 percent in 1988 and is projected at no more than 20 percent this year. The letter said that during that period, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s nonpetroleum exports have jumped from $ 3 billion to $ 14 billion last year, roughly equaling the income derived from crude oil, according to the newspaper.

<TEXT>
 Shareholders filed three suits in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> state court Wednesday to block the planned $ 18 billion merger between <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. One of the suits, filed by four <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shareholders against <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> Chairman, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, alleged the merger and a planned preliminary exchange of stock between the two companies _ known as a lock-up transaction _ would prevent an outsider from making a possibly higher bid for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> In the lock-up, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> will exchange 12.5 percent of its stock for 12 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s shares. Such transactions commonly are undertaken by companies planning to merge as a defense against unwanted takeovers. `` The merger and lock-up transaction are nothing more than a plan and scheme by the director-defendants to entrench themselves and to make it much more difficult and highly unlikely that <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> will be subject to an outside takeover,'' said the class action suit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The suit asked the court to declare the merger void or alternatively prevent the defendants from proceeding with it. The merger, which would be accomplished through a stock swap, would create the world's largest communications concern, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Spokesmen for Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said their companies had no comment on the suit. Court papers for the other two suits were not immediately available, and it was not immediately known who filed the actions or who the defendants were. The suits were filed in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> because Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> are incorporated here.

 If a student in the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> wants to give teacher a little apple, it will have to come from home. Fresh apples have been pulled from school cafeteria menus because of worries about carcinogenic pesticides. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, which feeds students in 1,200 public and parochial schools under a federal program, barred the sale of apples last month, at least until it receives advice from the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>, director of support services for the board. The Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has reported that the pesticide diaminozide, which is known by its brand name Alar, could increase the incidence of cancer in children who drink a lot of apple juice. Apple growers contended only about 4 percent of all apples sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> show any traces of Alar and those amounts are well below <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> standards. Alar is used to maintain firmness and resist bruising in fruits and vegetables. <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>'s program sells or hands out about 13 million apples a year. He said students had not been complaining about the fruit's disappearance `` It's only been a few weeks, and we offer a wide variety of fruits,'' he said. Applesauce and apple juice are harder to replace and will continue to be served, he said.

<HEAD>Soybeans Tumble As Speculators' Nerve Crumbles</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 13th graf, West Texas ..., to CORRECT that crude oil prices
rose, sted fell.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices fell as much as 10 -RCB- cents a bushel Wednesday, erasing much of the past week's gains as speculators unnerved by the looming Brazilian harvest and an increase in farmer selling backed away from the market. On other markets Wednesday, energy futures posted strong gains on signs of renewed tensions between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>; precious metals retreated; copper futures fell; and livestock and meat futures finished mostly lower. Grain futures followed soybeans lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat settled 1 -RCB- cents to 4 cents lower with March at $ 4.30 a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent to 2 -RCB- cents lower with March at $ 2.75 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 2 -LCB- cents to 5 cents lower with March at $ 2.05 a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 10 -RCB- cents lower with March at $ 7.55 -LCB- a bushel. Soybean growers in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the world's second-largest producer after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, are preparing to harvest their largest crop ever. The movement of Brazilian _ and then Argentine _ soybeans into the global pipeline will help ease the supply tightness that has contributed to the market's recent firm tone. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has estimated <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s 1988-89 soybean crop at 20 million metric tons compared with 17.8 million the previous year. On Wednesday, a widely watched private weather service raised its Brazilian soybean estimate to 20.7 million metric tons from 19.6 million. `` I think the real question is not whether it's going to be a record crop, but how much of a record,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, a grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean growers harvested 1.54 billion bushels last year, or about 41 million metric tons. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> said said a rise in soybean prices over the past 10 days had prompted more selling of stockpiled beans by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers. Oil futures rallied on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following a report that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ambassador had accused Iraqi soldiers of killing five Iranian soldiers on Feb. 17. The incident would mark the bloodiest clash between the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> nations since the beginning of their 7-month cease-fire. The energy market's rally also was seen as partly a reaction to Tuesday's weekly <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> report, which showed declines in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks of gasoline and distillates, although crude-oil supplies increased. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 24 cents to 45 cents higher with April at $ 18.54 a barrel; heating oil was .29 cent to .97 cent higher with April at 51.37 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .44 cent to .83 cent higher with April at 51.85 cents a gallon. Gold and silver futures retreated on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, selling off late in the session after gold for April delivery encountered resistance at $ 398.80 a troy ounce. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Savaiko </PERSON>, a metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said April gold's failure to close above $ 396 an ounce indicated `` the recent rally is tiring.'' Gold settled 30 cents to 60 cents lower with April at $ 395.40 an ounce; silver was 1.2 cents to 1.8 cents lower with May at $ 5.947 a troy ounce. Copper futures also finished lower on the Commodity Exchange after initially rising. Analysts said the decline reflected perceptions that physical demand for copper has slowed with the metal's rise in price during the past month. Copper settled 2.9 cents to 4.1 cents lower with May at $ 1.404 a pound. Weakening cash markets contributed to a late slump in cattle futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Most pork futures retreated on ideas that Wednesday's increase in hog marketings would result in lower cash prices on Thursday. Live cattle finished .25 cent to .45 cent lower with April at 77.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent lower to .03 cent higher with March at 81.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower to .08 cent higher with April at 44.10 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .25 cent lower to .12 cent higher with March at 38.85 cents a pound.

 Prices for Mexican crude oil exports to the Far East rose by 23 cents per barrel in February over January levels, the government oil monopoly <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Exports of <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION>'s light Isthmus crude sold in the Far East at $ 15.08 a barrel last month, up from $ 14.85 in January, <ORGANIZATION> Pemex </ORGANIZATION> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> slashed its shuttle fares and sold all its gates in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> in the fifth day of a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> strike Wednesday, and its sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> took up the lucrative New York-Miami run. Eastern, in a desperate attempt to lure back customers to its ailing <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> shuttle service, said it will reduce one-way fares to $ 12 on weekends, from $ 69 - $ 99, and $ 49 weekdays, down from $ 99 Pilots at other airlines continued strictly adhering to safety rules, but for a second day there was little evidence of a backup on runways. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> announced it would begin daily nonstop flights from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> said it will run four daily round trips. `` This is not a direct result of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> strike,'' <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said of the new routes. `` What this is, is a response to market demand of what we've seen in the past few days.'' In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> announced it had closed a $ 70 million deal with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, after months of talks, to acquire all eight of the airline's gates at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, third-largest of the airline's four hubs. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> said it will use the counter space, along with baggage and related services, for operations of <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which will merge with <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> this year. Eastern picked up $ 15 million more in a separate deal, selling <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> its Philadelphia-Tornonto and <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia-Montreal </ORGANIZATION> routes for $ 15 million. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> said both deals would require court approval if Eastern declares bankruptcy. The labor dispute rested Wednesday with courts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where Eastern went to court to appeal a judge's refusal to order union pilots back to the cockpits. Eastern contends it is near collapse, losing at least $ 2 million a day. Its lawyer said in court Tuesday the nation's seventh-largest carrier can not survive the week if its pilots maintain their support for the Machinists. The airline is running just 4 percent of its flights and says it will consider bankruptcy court, though as a last resort. It sent 9,500 workers home this week and has just a skeleton staff of 1,500 remaining. The 8,500-member Machinists union walked out Saturday, and with the support of pilots and flight attendants soon nearly shut down <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>. Eastern is seeking $ 125 million in concessions; the union wants $ 50 million in raises. The Machinists also threatened to disrupt commuter rail traffic with secondary boycotts, which it contends are legal under the 1926 Railway Labor Act. But the union held off when a federal judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> over the weekend temporarily barred rail workers from honoring Machinists picket lines. Among developments: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> have asked <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> to seek control of the carrier, and he said he is willing to talk with them. `` I would be willing to speak to the unions only if <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> permits me to, because I do not want to be accused by Eastern of interfering with the collective bargaining process,'' <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> had mulled a bid for Eastern a few months ago, when its boss, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, was considering selling But <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and the unions could n't agree on terms for a worker stake in a merger of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, and talks broke off. Eastern had no comment. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 100, would not comment on <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s statement but said in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>: `` If there is willingness -LRB- by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to sell, there are certainly interested parties. ... It would be a tremendous opportunity to see the phoenix rise from the ashes.'' _ In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> marketing vice president, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> denied that reduced shuttle fares were a move to protect the pending $ 365 million sale of the shuttle service to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Competitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it would not match the fares. _ In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> refused to allow commuter rail workers in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area to honor any Machinists picket lines. But the judges said they expect the dispute to go to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. _ <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, who issued the initial ruling, heard arguments Wednesday evening on whether to make permanent his ban, covering <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commuter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION>. The railroads carry hundreds of thousands of commuters. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, after 7 -LCB- hours testimony, recessed the hearing until 10 a.m. Thursday. He was not expected to rule immediately; his orders barring strikes at <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> and the other railroads expire at midnight Friday. _ Eastern lawyers filed notice with a federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on plans to continue efforts to force pilots to work. `` I do n't expect our brief to be filed until tomorrow morning,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>. _ In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, a federal judge Wednesday issued a preliminary injunction, extending a temporary restraining order that prohibited rail unions from honoring pickets set up by Machinists at <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> facilities, which carry 100,000 passengers daily. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, whose contract with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> expired in June, said the airline has asked to set up talks. Union spokesman <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said a meeting was set for Thursday. _ President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has resisted calls from organized labor and some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he appoint an emergency panel to mediate. But he has also said he will not tolerate disruptions throughout the transportation industry. `` The president believes that in a free enterprise system workers in business should work out their differences without congressional or governmental interference,'' Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said Wednesday on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` This Morning.'' If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intercedes, an emergency panel could impose a 60-day cooling-off period. Some union officials have said throughout the 17-month dispute that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> want to dismantle the airline. `` Our people have recognized from the very earliest days of this dispute that that kind of a result -LRB- bankruptcy -RRB- could be forthcoming,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON>. `` They are so fed up with the way they have been treated, so fed up with the environment on the job, that they're willing to walk away and if that is the result they'll accept it,'' he said on the CBS program. Airports reported no problems on the second day of a work-to-rule action by union pilots around the country. `` We're operating close to normal,'' said <PERSON> Mort </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` There have been sporadic requests for special handling by flight crews,'' such as having instructions repeated. `` There are no problems,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Braden </PERSON>, spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've got so much air space we're looking for new carriers.
