 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused Wednesday to stay the execution of a convicted child killer scheduled to die Thursday morning, after his attorneys lost similar appeals in three lower courts. The emergency request by <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was denied by the high court in a 7-2 vote. The justices also turned down his formal appeal to review his death sentence. Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, who oppose the death penalty in all circumstances, voted to spare <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. Earlier Wednesday, the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> denied a request for a stay of execution for <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, saying it did n't `` find merit in any of the claims raised.'' The 11th Circuit's decision Wednesday night followed rejection of <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' appeal by the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in the morning and by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> II in the afternoon. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal was filed in anticipation of the lower court rejections, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON>, head of the state agency that handles final appeals for inmates facing execution. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, 31, a former officer at <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION>, was originally scheduled to die Tuesday for the murder of an 8-year-old <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> girl, but the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> issued a 48-hour stay Monday. He is scheduled to die in the electric chair at <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> State Prison near <LOCATION> Starke </LOCATION> at 7 a.m. EDT Thursday. If <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> is put to death, he will be the second man executed in the state this year and the 21st since <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> resumed executions in 1979. In January, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was executed for killing a <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> schoolgirl _ the last in a string a serial killings that started in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> is under his fourth death warrant for the Jan. 23, 1978, murder of <PERSON> Trisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornley </PERSON>, a third-grader last seen on her way home from school. The girl's mutilated and naked body was found in a plastic bag March 15, 1978, by hunters in a remote area about three miles from her home. An obscene phone call to the girl's home was traced to <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' home, and he eventually admitted picking her up He said he recalls that she screamed at some point, he placed his hand over her mouth to silence her and she suffocated. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and his wife, a teacher's aide, were friends of the victim's parents. He had been scheduled to die in 1984 and twice in 1986 when three psychiatrists ruled him mentally competent to be executed. State law requires that inmates be able to understand why they are being punished before they can be executed.

 A chemical fire in an electronics plant Tuesday released an acid gas, and 19 people were hospitalized, authorities said. The fire that started in chemical processing equipment at <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dielectrics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s circuit board plant filled the sky with hydrogen bromide fumes before being brought under control around 4:30 p.m., said <PERSON> Cathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Shonk </PERSON> of the Fremont Fire Department. Hydrogen bromide is an acid gas that is extremely irritating to the nose and throat when inhaled, <PERSON> Shonk </PERSON> said. The cause of the fire was being investigated. Orange smoke filled the plant's halls. The fire department evacuated about 100 employees and 225 workers from the <ORGANIZATION> Sequoia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a training center next door to the factory in an industrial park.

 A fire that started while a tank truck was loading gasoline destroyed a fuel storage facility and 275,000 gallons of oil, burning the vehicle's driver critically, officials said. The fire sent up a column of smoke that could be seen for at least 20 miles. Five hours after the blaze broke out, flames still were shooting 50 feet in the air, but fire officials said the fire was under control and would be allowed to burn itself out overnight.

Sometimes you just get lucky.'' `` Triptych May-June,'' done by <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> in 1973 and inspired by the suicide of the artist's close friend, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON>, sold for $ 5.7 million.

A Sotheby sale next Tuesday features <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>'s `` Mata Mua,'' circa 1892, completed during the artist's first trip to <LOCATION> Tahiti </LOCATION>.

 The government on Wednesday rejected student protesters' demands that it recognize their new independent unions, setting the stage for more pro-democracy demonstrations. On Tuesday, student leaders gave the government 24 hours to recognize their student union or they would take to the streets again. Thousands demonstrated for democracy and freedom in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. The developments added new tension to a situation the government has been trying to calm by holding talks with officially sanctioned student unions. Last week's activism crested with a march of 150,000 students and their supporters in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s capital. The official student unions took no part in the marches, the biggest in communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s history, and student activists say the talks wo n't satisfy their yearnings for a freer and more open <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> police announced they would close central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square on Thursday, the 70th anniversary of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first student protests, in what appeared to be an effort to head off a new student march The government also said unidentified non-students who oppose <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule have been advising the student protesters from behind the scenes, and suggested that leading dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> might be one of them. Government spokesman <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON> told a news conference that these people `` try to accomplish during disturbances goals that they can not attain in circumstances of political stability.'' Yuan stopped short of directly accusing <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, an internationally renowned astrophysicist, of advising the student protesters. But he questioned <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>'s patriotism and said, `` The role Mr. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> wants to play in the current disturbances will be decided by his words and deeds.'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, who previously has called Marxism a failure and called for multi-party democracy, has not taken part in any of the student protests that began April 15. Speeches he made on campuses in 1986 were blamed for stirring up 1986-87 pro-democracy marches, and he was ousted from the party. Yuan refused to say what the government will do if students try to march Thursday. The protest in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most important trading and industrial city, began in the early afternoon when about 6,000 students, carrying banners reading `` give us democracy and freedom,'' blocked traffic in front of city government offices. Student leaders presented petitions demanding political reform and the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the protest ended about 10 p.m.. An American teacher said a class boycott, which started in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and spread earlier this week to <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION>, has moved to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> About half of the students at <ORGANIZATION> Fudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the city's leading school, are striking, said <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, Ore. He quoted student activists at <LOCATION> Fudan </LOCATION> as saying that student leaders from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> helped organize the strike and the march. Student leaders have also been sent to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for more coordination, he said. Earlier, students from <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> came to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for guidance with their movement. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, 65 student leaders from 33 universities bicycled more than 7 -LCB- miles to deliver an ultimatum to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature; the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, its cabinet; and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> In a handwritten letter, the students demanded the government recognize and hold talks with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION>, an independent association set up during their 2-week-old campaign for democratic reform. They want a free press, freedom of assembly and publication and an end to official corruption. Thursday marks the 70th anniversary of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first student demonstration, which turned into a movement for democratic and scientific reforms. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> students already have marched five times to Tiananmen Square since April 17, defying police warnings. An estimated 70,000 students at 41 colleges in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> also have been boycotting class since April 24. After a march April 27 drew cheers and applause from tens of thousands of bystanders, the government held a series of meetings with invited students. However, most of those invited have been members of the officially established student unions. The government has declared the students' new association illegal. For its part the association has rejected the talks with the government as a sham, accusing officials of trying to placate students without agreeing to democratic reforms. Despite student complaints, however, the government does seem to be responding to public pressure. On Saturday, Sunday and Monday, ministers of three government bureaus along with the government's leading spokesman and the mayor and party secretary of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> met with students. The meetings were unprecedented in a society whose leaders hide from public scrutiny. The state-run press has softened its shrill editorial stance on the movement and several in-depth reports on the talks and the demonstrations have appeared.

 Behind the red door on Makhoul Street in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, there's a watering hole where the regulars huddle to share a drink, seek shelter from the shelling, and maybe sing along to a Sinatra tune. Here's what the `` war clientele'' were up to on a recent night:

 Hunched over a beer in the Backstreet Bar, the only tavern in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> that has stayed open throughout the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> fighting, a doctor was decribing the horrors of the casualty ward after recent ferocious shelling. Around the Lebanese doctor, a veteran of more bad nights than he can recall in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s relentless bloodletting, the tavern was filled with about 40 people drinking from <PERSON> Habib </PERSON> <PERSON> Ne'aimeh </PERSON>'s well-stocked bar during a lull in the shelling Ne'aimeh has kept his bar open six nights a week during the fighting. `` When the shelling gets heavy I turn up the music,'' he said, standing behind his red and black bar on a recent night. `` These people are not as relaxed as they try to appear. They're drinking more.'' The doctor works at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, once one of the best medical centers in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Now, after 14 years of civil war, it's short of medicine and trained staff. It has taken several direct hits in recent fighting. `` One night 15 people were brought in,'' he said, clutching his beer tightly. `` Four of them were dead. `` There was a baby. We thought its mother was among the dead and we did n't know what to do with it,'' said the doctor. `` Suddenly, this woman appears out of nowhere as one of our people is trying to soothe the baby. Turns out it's the mother.'' That story had a happy ending. But for thousands of other Lebanese, the last seven weeks have brought only death, injury, devastation or confinement in bunkers and basements. Nearly 300 people have been killed and nearly 1,000 wounded since March 8 in almost non-stop battles between army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mainly Christian forces and an alliance of Syrian troops and Druse Moslem militiamen. Ne'aimeh's coterie of customers, what he calls his `` war clientele,'' regularly make it to the Backstreet through the darkened alleys, past packs of dogs scavenging through rotting, rat-infested garbage, to the red door in <LOCATION> Makhoul </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>. Shortages have forced Ne'aimeh to trim his menu to cold cuts, cheeses and grilled steaks. His customers, flung together by the war, are a bizarre group of people who for their own reasons have hung on in the Lebanese chaos and the kidnappings. As more than 150,000 people have fled the city amid the carnage in recent weeks, the Backstreet has become an oasis for this disparate group. There are Swiss from the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, Spanish and Belgians from the French-based Medecins Sans Frontiers agency, a couple of Russians, the odd Bulgarian or two and some Lebanese. Ne'aimeh is a <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, one of several thousand who live in the Moslem sector. Most are leftists, with little in common with the Maronite Catholics, who make up the vast majority of the Christians trapped in their enclave in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the mountains and coastal strip running north. His only waiter is a Sunni Moslem _ the others refuse to leave their underground shelters to go to work _ and the cook's a Shiite Moslem. Despite their different religious preferences, they're a tight team, a microcosm of what's possible in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> if the warring sects and factions could only get their act together. This night at the bar, everyone's having a good time, letting it all out. But there's an undercurrent of apprehension. The laughter sometimes has a brittle edge to it. Everyone knows someone who's been killed or wounded or lost a relative, or whose home has been hit in the bombardments. They've all wondered whether the next rocket or shell to fall will have their name on it Most are skeptical things will get better, and many are trying to leave <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. As the sound system belted out <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> singing `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' everyone joined in the line `` I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps'' _ enjoying the irony that the shelling makes sleep a luxury few get in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. At that moment, the bar's generator sputtered and gave out About 11 p.m., rockets began to arc across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line, three miles of unrelieved devastation, where Christians and Moslems have faced each other from sandbagged positions and gutter apartment buildings for 14 years. `` Incoming or outgoing?'' a young woman asked as an explosion thundered nearby. `` Incoming, I think. I saw the flash,'' a young man answered hesitantly. `` Anybody got a radio?'' someone said. `` What's it say?'' A Lebanese reporter working for a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> news organization tuned his transistor radio to the Christian-run Voice of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` Shells hitting the Christian side,'' the reporter said. `` It's outgoing. `` That's OK then,'' the young man replied. Then the radio said the source of the shelling had been pinpointed to west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The young man lost his poise, told Ne'aimeh he'd pay his tab later, and left. He knew the Christian army gunners were probably at that moment training their 155mm howitzers on the area around the Backstreet Bar to retaliate.

 Despite severe economic problems, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is spending up to $ 5 billion a year to rebuild its military now that a cease-fire has been reached in the 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, analysts report. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> also are warming and the fundamentalist Moslem regime is turning to the Soviet bloc increasingly for arms, apparently paying for tanks, artillery and other weapons with crude oil. On Monday, Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> soon would buy weapons from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and was negotiating with countries he did not identify for advanced fighter bombers. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> must broaden its source of arms, he said, because `` if we depend on one particular country or bloc, then they take advantage of the situation. ... They want to impose their own ideology on us.'' <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON> did not say what kind of Soviet weapons <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would buy or what the cost would be. `` Strengthening the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s defense capabilities is one of the major tasks we face during the reconstruction period,'' President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> told senior military commanders at a recent conference. Both belligerents have large forces along the cease-fire line and, with peace talks deadlocked eight months after they began, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s rapid buildup is causing concern among Western officials. `` It's very worrisome. They're rebuilding much faster than we expected,'' a senior official of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also is seeking new weapons to modernize its armed forces, and both countries have been developing their own arms industries, including missile production, since the cease-fire Aug. 20. Earlier this month, the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> daily <PERSON> Payam </PERSON> <PERSON> e-Enqelab </PERSON> said the missile firepower of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> will `` increase five-fold in the near future'' using domestically produced weapons with ranges of up to 100 miles. The American source said of the Iranian rearmament program: `` It appears they're talking in the range of $ 20 billion over the next 4-5 years. They've got serious economic problems and yet they're spending this kind of money on rebuilding their military The question is: to what end?'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other Western officials said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s major arms suppliers in the latter stages of the gulf war, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, still are its main sources. Diplomatic sources in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region reported recently that the Chinese are helping <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> build a plant to produce surface-to-surface missiles. Al-Ittihad, a daily in <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION>, quoted military sources last month as saying <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would provide 40 new Silkworm anti-ship missiles, a reconnaissance satellite and batteries of HQ-2J surface-to-air missiles, the Chinese version of the Soviet SAM-2. Evidence increases, however, that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also is turning to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for Soviet-designed weapons. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources said most of the equipment is tanks, trucks, artillery and small arms rather than high-technology weapons. Gulf newspapers have said <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> would supply nearly 500 tanks, armored vehicles and tank transporters; help build a naval base on <LOCATION> Qeshm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, and convert a tractor factory in <LOCATION> Arak </LOCATION> to produce armored vehicles. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> will supply <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> with 180 T-54 and T-55 tanks and help build a plant to make anti-tank weapons, the papers have reported. No independent confirmation of the reports was available, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has made trade agreements with several Soviet bloc states, including <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, providing for payment in crude oil. It has a similar pact with <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, now the world's sixth largest arms exporter. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official media, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said only that the deals involve `` products and services,'' but analysts believe arms are involved. `` The <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc will be swimming with T-54s and T-55s because of <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> force reductions and it makes a lot of sense that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would be getting a lot of hardware from this quarter,'' said <PERSON> Hans-Heino </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopietz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> source's view, arms deals with the Soviet bloc `` have obvious advantages, including all-land transportation through <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s northern neighbor. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> also has strengthened military links with its eastern neighbor <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, a Moslem nation. The Pakistanis are developing their own arms industry and are advanced in the production of missiles and some other high-tech weapons. Both Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> <PERSON> Sattari </PERSON>, the air force commander, and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamkhani </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> minister, visited <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> in recent weeks to meet with senior Pakistani military officials. `` We'll soon see the fruits of these talks, which have defense and other objectives,'' <PERSON> Shamkhani </PERSON> said without elaboration. Official Iranian media have reported a defense allocation equivalent to $ 5.85 billion in this year's budget, described as about half last year's total. Reselat, a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> daily, said <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> also approved a secret budget bill in which defense spending was considerably higher. Exiled opponents of the regime claimed to have a copy of the secret budget. They said it included $ 4.9 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and $ 3.6 billion for Revolutionary Guards. The <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, also told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> those figures did not represent <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s `` entire planned military spending,'' Analysts have estimated that, on the basis of such needs as combat jets, tanks, radars and missiles, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would spend about $ 5 billion a year on new weapons.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Palestinian uprising has produced a new game that has Israelis battling stone-throwing Palestinians on computer screens and getting burned _ either by firebombs or world public opinion. Computer buff <PERSON> Shahar </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> said the game is being passed around by computer enthusiasts and is popular among children in <LOCATION> Rehovot </LOCATION>, a town near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> housing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Weizman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> is a photo editor at the Israeli daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION>, which printed a story on the game Tuesday. He said the program was signed only by `` Mike'' and added: `` Some details of the program indicate it was done in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... I do n't know who wrote the program but he seems to be a very good programmer.'' The game is titled `` The Intefadeh,'' the Arabic word for `` uprising'' that is commonly used for the nearly 17-month revolt against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Palestinian children have made up their own street game on the uprising in which they take turns playing soldiers and stone-throwers, shoot with plastic guns and even hold mock funerals for `` martyrs.'' `` The Intefadeh'' is much more sophisticated, with players getting points for inflicting casualties _ but only with specific weapons allowed by changing rules. These mirror real life, since Israeli soldiers face a complex set of regulations on using tear gas, rubber or plastic bullets and live ammunition in putting down riots in the occupied lands. The game has political implications. Players gain points for helping to elect right-wing politicans. Players can lose points for upsetting world public opinion, again reflecting reality. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has drawn international criticism over the more than 450 Palestinian deaths in the revolt. One set of instructions for the game begins: `` You can use the wooden club you were issued on any rioter. Use tear gas any time you feel it is needed. You are authorized to shoot any rioter with rubber bullets. Shoot rubber or plastic bullets at any rioter who throws Molotov cocktail. You are not allowed to use live ammunition under any circumstances.'' The screen then shows a typical street in a Palestinian village or town, with a lone <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier facing protesters. The trooper is pelted with rocks and firebombs and may respond with gunfire or chase the protesters along narrow `` streets.'' But the rules can change according to who is the `` defense minister in charge,'' randomly chosen by the computer and listed at the top of the screen. Under <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s real-life foreign minister, live ammunition can not be used. But under <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> _ a hawk forced to resign as defense minister in 1983 during <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> _ live ammunition is a must. Points are scored by inflicting as many casualties as possible within a given time limit by using proper ammunition. An injured soldier is evacuated by an ambulance or bursts into flames and is declared dead. The computer labels him `` just another victim of Arab terrorism.'' Palestinians injured by tear gas move in dizzy circles, but intensify stone-throwing attacks later. At the end of the game, an `` Israeli Defense Forces evaluation form'' is displayed on the screen, featuring the number of protesters injured, killed or captured. A successful player is congratulated for helping Israeli right-wingers win the national elections. The game is made even more complex, however, by the presence of the `` public opinion index.'' Indiscriminate shooting of protesters can lead to a chilling judgment on the screen. One example: `` Performance: You have gone wild. Public opinion index: zero. Your inefficiency in supressing the violence is appalling. You must be sleeping on the job. The government lost the elections mostly as a result of your inaction.''

 SIRISIAR BRIDGE, On the <LOCATION> Indian-Nepalese </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Border </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A friendly sort of friction has set in at this crossing point between <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the political and military giant of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, a tiny and landlocked kingdom. For more than a month, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> has been defying and exasperating <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> by refusing to renegotiate trade agreements on <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s terms. As a result, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has imposed a partial blockade and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> is suffering severe shortages of fuel needed to operate motor vehicles, provide electrical power and cook food. Medicines, baby food and other essential goods also are in short supply. The problem is as tangled as the traffic jam of bullock carts, horse-drawn carriages and bicycle-powered rickshaws trying to negotiate the narrow wooden bridge over the <LOCATION> Sirisiar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> without getting stuck in the cracks between the creaking planks. The bullocks' long, pointed horns scrape and snag on the rickshaws' cloth canopies, much as the government officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION> are scraping and snagging in the political impasse. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, population 880 million, perceives <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> as an ungrateful neighbor, seeking preferential treatment for itself while refusing to grant <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> reciprocal privileges. <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, population 17 million, sees <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> as a bit of a bully, trying to thwart Nepalese efforts to diversify its trading partners. Officially speaking, the Indian blockade is not total. Practically speaking, its effects come close to being total. `` This is not a blockade. You can see the trucks are moving,'' customs collector <PERSON> Asit </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitra </PERSON> said in the Indian border town of <LOCATION> Raxaul </LOCATION> as a score of vehicles lumbered over the bridge to <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, hauling burlap bags of salt, cases of baby formula and brand new _ but empty _ tanks for cooking gas. `` The goods are coming in, but not as they were,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Vimal </PERSON> <PERSON> Srivastav </PERSON>, three miles up the road in the Nepalese town of <LOCATION> Birganj </LOCATION>. At the <LOCATION> Birganj </LOCATION> customs yard, the goods are unloaded from Indian trucks. But the porters are sleeping in the midday heat atop the cartons they normally would be transferring to Nepalese trucks. The diesel and gasoline to run the trucks 75 miles north to <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, the Nepalese capital, no longer arrive from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, itself a net importer of petroleum products. `` It's like you get the torch -LRB- flashlight -RRB-, but not the battery,'' said <PERSON> Pashupati </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaha </PERSON>, a hotel owner in <LOCATION> Birganj </LOCATION>. When the bilateral trade and transit treaties expired March 23 with no replacements in the offing, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> closed 13 of the 15 official crossing points on the 1,095-mile border. Only Raxaul and <PERSON> Jogbani </PERSON> remain open. <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> wanted to renegotiate the two treaties separately, one governing trade with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the other covering vital transit rights from <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION> to the border for non-Indian imports. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sought a single treaty to safeguard its own trade with <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> has little to offer foreign trading partners, apart from goatskins and a few spices. But it imports machinery, housewares, textiles and food in addition to pharmaceutical and petroleum products. For the last two years, about 40 percent of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s imports were Indian. Fifteen years ago, more than 80 percent were Indian. Especially of concern to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> are recent Nepalese efforts to expand trade with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s longtime regional rival and the only other country with direct land access to <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s pique heightened last fall when <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> purchased anti-aircraft guns and other weapons from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, prompting two questions in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>: Why was <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> making purchases from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and why did the tiny <LOCATION> Himalayan </LOCATION> monarchy, which has about 35,000 men under arms compared to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 1.4 million, need anti-aircraft guns, anyway? <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> considers its trade and defense needs its own business. `` Trade has its own nature,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shailendra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> <PERSON> Upadhyaya </PERSON> told a reporter in <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION> this week. `` Trade will increase normally with any country with which we receive a fair deal.'' One more nettle is <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s decision requiring the 150,000 Indians in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> to obtain work permits, while <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has made no similar requirements of the estimated 5 million Nepalese in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. In addition, <PERSON> Birganj </PERSON> had long been a shopper's delight for Indians, whose own country prides itself on self-sufficiency and imports little of the Western and Japanese goods widely available in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. The Nepalese joke about their ability to sell just about anything with a foreign label to Indian visitors. <PERSON> Shaha </PERSON>, the Birganj hotel owner, remarked, `` You can blame <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> for this. The Indians can find some of these things cheaper in <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION>, but they want to come to <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and buy. Some merchants import saris from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, stamp ` Made in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>' on them, and the Indians are very happy to buy.'' `` The Nepalese will buy seven or eight times what they need of something, import it through <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, then smuggle it back across the border to sell it in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>,'' an Indian government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

 The surprise declaration by Sudanese rebels of a monthlong cease-fire reprieves the <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> government's beleaguered troops and boosts an international effort to save 100,000 people facing starvation It also raises hopes for an end to six years of civil war that drains $ 1 million a day from the coffers of one of the world's poorest countries Monday's announcement by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, comes at the height of his greatest success of the war _ a six-month string of victories that has government forces reeling. Rebel fighters also have been intensifying pressure on the strategic southern capital, <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>. Its fall could have determined the war's outcome by forcing the government from its largest stronghold in the embattled south. But at least as important, the cease-fire could boost the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' struggling operation to transport more than 100,000 tons of food and supplies to the south before heavy rains start this month. Last year, relief officials say up to 500,000 southerners died in the fighting or from war-induced disease and famine in villages isolated by flooded roads and airstrips. <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>, a U.S.-educated renegade army colonel, said the unilateral truce will hold only so long as the government refrains from redeploying or reinforcing its troops. He said it could be extended. Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> welcomed the move. `` Each step taken by <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> toward peace will be reciprocated by two steps from the government,'' he said in a May Day speech. Only last month, <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> rejected a U.N.-proposed `` month of tranquillity'' to allow the $ 132 million relief operation easy access to 2.3 million war-affected southerners. Instead, he guaranteed safe conduct for specific relief convoys. But attacks by unidentified armed groups, bureaucratic hassles, inadequate transport infrastructure and bad planning have hampered the operation. Only 37,000 tons of food was delivered in April. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials say they will continue until the rains cut transport routes. `` I think the overriding reasons behind this decision are political, but they are bound to be connected with the relief effort,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, the regional director of <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> who conducts most <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> negotiations with the rebels. `` We're keeping our fingers crossed, but it ought to help the operation if only by easing things and reducing the level of anxiety,'' <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Military experts in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> interpreted the rebels' rejection of the original truce as evidence of unwillingness to impede their battlefield winning streak. Since then, <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> has come under army pressure and approved a tentative peace plan, which the rebels welcomed with cautious optimism. The cease-fire `` was the next logical step in the peace process,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>, a lecturer at <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Reading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a specialist on <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> who returned from <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> last week. `` Now it's up to the government to arrange for further steps,'' <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>'s broadcast said all his forces will remain in their positions `` to wait for the government to implement the requirements of the Sudanese peace initiative.'' A joint technical military committee then would work out a comprehensive cease-fire, he said. The agreement's most politically sensitive clause calls for the suspension of harsh Islamic laws in force since late 1983. The mainly animist and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> rebels took up arms against the Moslem-dominated government a few months earlier, demanding autonomy for the south. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>, the leader of a Sudanese Moslem sect, approved the suspension last month, leaving the way clear for a constitutional conference. In the two years that the rebels have won an upper hand in the war, southern civilians have suffered as both sides used food as a weapon. <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>, a city of dusty streets and thatched-roof mud huts whose population is swollen by refugees to five times its normal 30,000, has been besieged for more than two years. Rebels intensified their attacks these past few months. `` The <ORGANIZATION> SPLA </ORGANIZATION>'s military successes created a very difficult political situation for them,'' said <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>. `` If they took over the major towns in the south ... it would mean a de facto separation of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, and it would be much more difficult to try and negotiate a peaceful settlement for a united <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. Now, they negotiate from a position of strength.'' Military sources in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> say about 20,000 troops are holed up in the middle of <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>. One source estimated the army's strength at 75,000 and the rebels at 57,000. But government troops are outnumbered in the war because only 10,000 soldiers remain in major southern towns other than <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>.

 When Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> won a fifth term three weeks ago, it should have been a time of celebration for the 71-year-old sharecropper's son. Instead, he found himself facing what's become the political crisis of his career. After 16 years of an administration free of personal scandal, the usually bland and steady <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> is the subject of a conflict-of-interest probe for accepting thousands of dollars in consulting fees from banks that did business with the city. He says he was unaware of the business ties when he accepted the money. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> also is under fire because his daughter was employed by a project to which he helped funnel nearly $ 400,000 of city money, the Task Force for Africa-Los Angeles Relations. He said he was unaware she had been hired. The allegations, which began surfacing at the end of the campaign, have tarnished the nice-guy image of <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, a former police lieutenant dubbed the Teflon Mayor for his ability to escape blame for the city's gang, growth and pollution problems. Other mayors have had bigger problems. Political allies of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> have committed suicide or gone to prison. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> admitted a close personal relationship with a woman not his wife. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> has been slapped with a paternity suit by a former city employee. But for <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, probably the blandest of big-city mayors, it's a major embarrassment For politically dull <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> it's a rare taste of a scandal at the very top. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> has scrambled to defuse the controversy by placing his investments _ which range from an estimated $ 101,000 to $ 1 million _ in a blind trust. He has established an ethics panel _ which announced Monday it wo n't investigate <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and will instead rewrite the city ethics code to restore public trust in city government. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> also has retained lawyers from <LOCATION> Manatt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phelps </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rothenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> political insiders that is handling the ethics defense of House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. He is refusing comment until a city investigation is completed. But allegations surface daily. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> reported that <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> was allowed to hold $ 600,000 in city money for three months in 1987 without paying interest. It said the account was set up by <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>. Two months after the situation was discovered, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> started earning $ 18,000 a year as a consultant to the bank. He has since returned the money, saying he was unaware <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> had business ties with the city. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, the city's first black mayor, won a fifth term April 11, barely escaping a runoff with challenger <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> and drawing the lowest turnout in decades. `` Unquestionably the issues that have been raised over the course of the last three weeks have raised some doubts in the minds of some people,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. Supporters predict, however, he will survive the controversy. `` He's a super-quality guy. He has never done anything the least bit questionable on anything,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coliseum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and a Republican who supports the Democratic <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>. `` He's so perfect that people want to knock him off his hill and find his imperfections,'' he added. <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, who made headlines by buying back semi-automatic weapons from the public, said: `` I think the quicker we get to the bottom of this matter the better everything's going to be. Business at City Hall is stopped. It's at a standstill.'' In addition to examining <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s relationships with Far East and the African task force, investigators are focusing on <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> was paid at least $ 71,000 to serve on its board while it did business with the city. He resigned the post the day after his election.

<HEAD>Bionic Duo Win Battle of Sunday Movies</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s bionic reunion garnered some bionic ratings, outrunning <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s critically praised `` My Name is Bill W.'' and the first installment of CBS' two-part <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> saga. The Sunday showdown was the first big movie faceoff of the May sweeps, one of four months when network affiliates' local ratings are measured to determine advertising rates. According to <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Bionic Showdown: The Return of the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman II'' ranked 11th among prime-time shows for the week, with a rating of 17.6 and a 28 share. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` My Name is Bill W.,'' the story of the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, had a 15.2 and 24 and ranked 24th. `` Guts & amp; Glory: The Rise and Fall of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'' got a 14.0 and a 23 share to rank 31st. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 90.4 million homes with television. The share is a percentage of sets in use. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne,'' even though a repeat, edged a new episode of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show'' for first place. `` Cosby'' had a slightly lower rating, but a higher share. That apparently was due to daylight-saving time's disadvantage for earlier shows. There are fewer viewers in front of the set at 8 p.m. EDT when `` Cosby'' is broadcast. `` Roseanne'' is on at 9 p.m. The rest of the top 10 last week were: `` Cheers'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` A Different World'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Murder, She Wrote'' CBS; `` Golden Girls'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Dear John'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` L.A. Law'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` The Wonder Years'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; and `` Empty Nest'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> racked up its 45th weekly victory in a row, with an average rating of 13.7 to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' 11.7 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s 11.4. The `` CBS Evening News'' tied `` ABC World News Tonight'' in news ratings, each getting a 9.8 rating and 21 share. `` NBC Nightly News'' had an 8.7 rating and 19 share.

 Educators hope a new program will make a middle school a model for race relations and improved academics. The restructured school _ to be called the <ORGANIZATION> Prospect </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multiracial </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multicultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multiethnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> _ is to offer programs to encourage students to respect other races and teach staff members how to instruct students of other races, officials said Tuesday. `` Perhaps it will improve race relations throughout the entire city,'' said Principal <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pipkin </PERSON>. `` It will be the model where we develop programs, policies and practices for district-wide use,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said no new students or staff members would be added to the present <ORGANIZATION> Prospect </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the city's <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> neighborhood. She said the new programs are to begin next fall. School Superintendent <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said the idea came from principals and consultants who studied city schools last fall. He said concerns about racism stemmed from occasional fights in schools and the disproportionate number of black students who are suspended or referred to special education classes. `` I would n't say it's at this point a serious problem, a crisis situation, but we do n't want it to get to that level,'' <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said. Of about 39,600 public school students in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, 52 percent are black and 48 percent are white, officials said.

<TEXT>
 The old Chinese habit of shunning banks has caused an 82-year-old farmer to lose most of his life savings to mildew, an official newspaper reported today. When <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dexiang </PERSON>, who had buried his life savings of about $ 1,200 in his courtyard five years ago, dug up the money recently he discovered it was moldy `` almost beyond recognition,'' the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported. The farmer in northeastern <LOCATION> Liaoning </LOCATION> province was only able to salvage $ 400, which he exchanged for new bills at a local bank, it said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which has a surplus of cash in its overheated economy, is suffering from a shortage of funds for investment because many people, fearing runaway inflation, traditionally refuse to put their money in the bank. Personal caches like <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON>'s account for an estimated $ 133 billion. The interest rate on one-year deposits was raised last year from 7.2 percent to 8.64 percent, but fails to keep pace with 36 percent inflation.

<HEAD>Double-Stuffed Welfare Checks in the Mail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some of the state's poor opened their monthly benefit checks this week and got a surprise _ an extra check. But they ca n't cash in on the windfall because the extra checks belong to another recipient of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. The program sends out 23,000 checks totaling $ 4.5 million a month. The problem likely was caused by a mail-sorting machine at a company that has the contract for sorting mail and stuffing envelopes for the program, said <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitlock </PERSON>, who directs the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> division that administers the program. If the suction cups of the mail-sorting machine come down on computer holes on the checks, the suction picks up not only the intended check but also the one behind it, <PERSON> Whitlock </PERSON> said. The problem has surfaced in at least six counties, but may be more widespread, said <PERSON> Whitlock </PERSON>.

 Student protests from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> took aim Tuesday at proposed budget cuts, tuition increases and union recognition, and student pressure at a prestigious college led to a ban on <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> products. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, thousands of protesting <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students skipped classes and marched through lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> as a deadline approached on a state spending bill that would reduce money for higher education and force a tuition increase. Hours later, Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> vetoed the tuition hike. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hadley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holyoke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> administrators, under pressure from students to boycott Coca-Cola products because of the company's ties to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, announced a monthlong ban of the company's soft drinks. In the central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Granby </LOCATION>, nearly 400 students walked out of high school and into a heavy rain to protest budget cuts the principal says could cost the school at least three teachers and several programs. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, students and others who met to discuss a decision to ban a rap music concert Friday at <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> were released without bond Tuesday after a hearing on felony trespassing charges. Twenty-seven people, including students from several <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> colleges and some non-students, were arrested Monday for refusing to leave a student center, said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, teaching and research assistants on Wednesday were to begin a two-day walkout and picket the four major campus entrances to protest the school's refusal to recognize their union In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, about 4,000 students stepped up protests that began last week. Placard-carrying, chanting students from the university system assembled in front of the World Trade Center, where <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office is located. They blocked traffic for several hours, then paraded through the streets past City Hall to the <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> financial district. `` It's not just a matter of this tuition hike. If we let them go, it will be more,'' said <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, a 29-year-old physics student at <ORGANIZATION> Hunter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` It will cut out the opportunity for people to rise.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who had until midnight to sign or veto the tuition increase measure, had given no indication what his decision would be. But one hour before the deadline, it was announced he had vetoed the legislation, saying university officials had n't proven the need for the extra money. At <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION>, officials outlined immediate steps to replace <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> products with beverages from companies with little or no business interest in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The announcement came in a one-page release that gave no explanation for the move. Students at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION> and several other colleges in western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> have pressed administrators for two months to remove <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> products because, they say, the company is reaping profits that benefit racially segregated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` I think it's a monumental step. I think it shows some responsibility on the part of the adminstration in terms of listening to students,'' said <PERSON> Kuhusu </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanzu </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, which organized the campus boycotts. In <LOCATION> Granby </LOCATION>, students who comprise virtually the entire population of the little school stood for 45 minutes in heavy rain before returning to class, said Principal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullinan </PERSON>. `` The students felt this was the only way they could get their message across in a way that people would notice,'' the principal of the Granby Junior-Senior High said. At <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, neither the 3,200-member Association of Graduate Student Employees nor university officials would predict how many assistants would join the walkout. `` So far, our indications are that this could be more symbolic than a significant disruption,'' said university spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Debley </PERSON>. The dispute is over the university's view that the assistants' work can not be considered employment because it is so intertwined with educational experience, said <PERSON> Debley </PERSON> Assistants receive annual stipends from the university or research institutions averaging about $ 10,000. The association has been seeking recognition since 1983 as a union, but the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> recently ruled students do not have to be considered employees for the purposes of collective bargaining. The association is appealing the decision.

 Say bye-bye to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> The </PERSON> <PERSON> Cat </PERSON>, the drug-addled feline who's smooched <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> and swapped brains with <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> and the other residents of `` Bloom County'' are soon to be history, the latest victims of funny-page flameout. Cartoonist <PERSON> Berke </PERSON> Breathed pulled the plug on the Pulitzer Prize-winning `` Bloom County'' earlier this week, becoming the third comic-page fixture to leave fans hanging in recent years. But while <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> put their characters on vacation when cartooning became a grind, Breathed opted to off his. `` A good comic strip is no more eternal than a ripe melon. The ugly truth is that in most cases, comics age less gracefully than their creators. ` Bloom County' is retiring before the stretch marks show,'' Breathed said in explaining his decision. Readers of nearly 800 newspapers now will learn to live without big-beaked penguin Opus, his buddy <PERSON> Milo </PERSON> and motley party animal Bill The Cat; no longer will their lives intersect those of <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> or <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> _ three public figures frequently skewered by Breathed. But such bad news is becoming all too common for the discerning comic reader, who in the recent years has lost <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>'s `` The Far Side'' and <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>'s `` Doonesbury'' for extended periods while their creators escaped the day-to-day drudgery. `` I need a breather. Investigative cartooning is a young man's game,'' said <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> in announcing his hiatus from January 1983 to September 1984 _ a move that was questioned by veteran cartoonists such as <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Caniff </PERSON> of `` Steve Canyon. `` Another guy is waiting in the wings, and once you're out you often ca n't get back in _ the space is filled,'' said <PERSON> Caniff </PERSON>, who has since died. Similarly, <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>'s syndicate editor, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON>, explained the cartoonist `` felt he needed to get away from the deadline situation for a while so he could try to regenerate his cells.'' `` The Far Side'' is due back in 1990. While <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> and <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> took breathers to escape burnout, Breathed will resume his career with an entirely new Sundays-only strip. Others in the business say they understand his decision; penning a daily strip is anything but a million laughs for its creator. `` It's like pedaling a bicycle above a rotating blade, knowing that if you stop you'll fall and get cut up,'' said `` Peanuts'' cartoonist <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>, whose strip is in its fourth decade. `` You ca n't plan like a novelist, where you have three or four years to work,'' said <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>. `` A cartoonist does n't have time to stop. It's go, go, go continuously.'' Breathed's strip says sayonara Aug. 6, although there is hope that one resident of `` Bloom County'' _ nobody's saying which one _ may survive its doomsday. The cartoonist's new characters will not resemble the old ones `` with maybe one exception,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, general manager and editorial director of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which syndicates the strip. Opus, anyone?

 Nevadans voted 3-1 Tuesday to approve a $ 52 million mining tax hike, but balloting was close on a plan to double the money <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> can borrow for new state construction. With 25 percent of 609 precincts counted, the mining tax proposal was favored 26,692-7 ,966 The vote on the construction measure was 18,363 for and 17,051 against. Election officials around the state predicted low voter turnouts, ranging from 30 to 40 percent of the more than 383,000 people eligible to vote. `` It's nothing great but it's steady,'' <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> Clerk-Recorder <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> said of early voter turnout, which he estimated at about 30 percent. Recent polls indicated the mining tax would win approval. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and key lawmakers warned that without approval of the plan, the state would face fiscal chaos. Had the measure lost, officials said, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> would be in session an extra month slashing budgets and raising taxes to make up for the loss of the anticipated mining tax revenues, expected to be $ 52 million over a two-year period. The law would allow the state to impose a 5 percent tax on the net proceeds of mines. The ballot question was the result of an agreement struck during the 1987 Legislature between the mining industry, lawmakers and then-Gov. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>. The other question on the ballot would double the money <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> can borrow for new state construction. The governor's proposed budget includes money generated by state bond sales for new prison and university construction projects. Officials have argued that without doubling the constitutional limit on bond debt to 2 percent of the assessed value of all taxable land, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> will have to pay cash for such projects. But opponents argue that while <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> needs the bond money, lawmakers who wrote supporting and opposing arguments for the proposal intentionally neglected to mention that the state must repay new bond sales through higher property taxes.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of dead birds, snared in a giant glob of sticky oil, line a beach 300 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, victims of the spreading crude that has devastated <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s coast for weeks. While enviromentalists, government and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials trade barbs over blame, the oil drifts inexorably, fouling the shoreline and leaving dead, dying or dirtied birds, fish, otters, seals and sea lions. Even <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s lumbering, powerful brown bears have been seen prowling on oil-caked beaches. The oil is selective: It leap-frogs large stretches of coast, then hits others with contamination ranging from a light film to ankle-deep goo. `` We landed along a wide tidal basin, about six miles of beach,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Bane </PERSON>, superintendent of Katmai National Park. `` We found oil debris in large quantities throughout the tidal zone. We saw 2,000 to 3,000 dead birds. ... You ca n't really tell what they are. They're one big blob of oil.'' Since March 24, when the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> smashed into <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and leaked 10.1 million gallons of crude through its shattered hull, the reports of destroyed wildlife have multiplied steadily. The spill has reached <LOCATION> Chignik </LOCATION>, 525 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, and residents there are fearful the oil may interfere with their salmon season, which begins next week. `` What we found, say in every 100-foot distance, was four to eight dead murres on the average,'' <PERSON> Bane </PERSON> said of the sea birds. `` We also saw fresh bear tracks going back into the impacted areas. There was evidence of foxes and other scavengers. We observed one bear _ a sow and three yearlings _ that was in the contaminated area, feeding on dead birds. ...

 The countdown advanced smoothly today toward Thursday's scheduled launch of Atlantis with five astronauts and a robot probe to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. `` This time we're going to see if we can get it right,'' astronaut <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who will command the flight, said Tuesday. Four days earlier, a launch attempt was called off just 31 seconds before the planned liftoff. `` Looks like the vehicle's been turned around real well,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> told reporters. `` We're extremely pleased the folks here at the cape were able to do such a good and quick job getting it ready to go again.'' The other crew members are pilot <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabe </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleave </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Thagard </PERSON>.

Shuttle weather forecasters said there was a 70 percent chance conditions would be favorable.

Atlantis will carry into space the $ 550 million <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> probe, which the astronauts are to dispatch on a 15-month journey to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. The probe is to orbit the planet and map its cloud-shrouded surface with a high resolution radar system. The launch attempt was halted on Friday because of a short circuit in a fuel pump. Technicians working around the clock replaced the pump and a suspect fuel line in half the time expected. Engineers thought there was a leak in the fuel line, but tests turned up nothing. They believe a vapor cloud seen spewing from the line, thought to be gas, might have been trapped air. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON>, a shuttle test director, said the new countdown, which started Tuesday, was compressed from three days to two by eliminating some `` hold time'' that is built into the countdown in case of problems and by not repeating some tasks completed in the first attempt.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has closed down for its annual weeklong series of spring holidays, including one created by the government this year just to encourage the industrious workforce to let its reputation slide a bit. For many, the annual `` Golden Week'' started Friday, giving them the rare opportunity to take up to nine days off in a row. For others, time off began today, the first of three consecutive official national holidays. April 29, which fell on Friday, has been a holiday for more than 60 years, marking the birthday of the late Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. After his death Jan. 7, its name was changed to Greenery Day. Constitution Day falls on May 3 and Children's Day on May 5. This year, the government has made May 4 a national holiday also, to encourage more people to take consecutive days off. `` It's different from foreign countries. Japanese generally ca n't take several days of vacation at one time,'' said <PERSON> Reiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomizawa </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest travel agency. `` People even used to work every other day during Golden Week until the government made May 4 a holiday this year,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tomizawa </PERSON> said. `` It's just the national character of the Japanese to work hard without vacations.'' But government officials believe the Japanese should devote more time to leisure activities and spend more money on both them and imports in order to reduce the nation's huge trade surplus. Earlier this year, the government instituted a shortened five-day work week every other week for government employees. It is enouraging private business to follow suit. A record 17.7 million Japanese, or 14.7 percent of the population, are gong on trips of more than one night this week, and an all-time high of 365,000 are taking advantage of the high value of the yen to go overseas, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. The most popular family destinations this year are <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, Guam and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, the bureau said. Young, single `` office ladies'' are turning toward <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the agency said. They usually save money by living at their parents' home, and they have a reputation for being big holiday spenders. Japanese are spending an average $ 2,107 on travel abroad, up 8.7 percent, and $ 394, up 8.9 percent, for domestic travel, according to the agency's study. Many workers, however, see Golden Week as a time to lounge around at home and avoid the jammed highways, hot springs, and mountain resorts. `` It's too crowded and expensive to do anything,'' said <PERSON> Katsuya </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirai </PERSON>, 33, who works in the sales department of a Japanese automaker. `` And it's before our June bonus, so I do n't have any money right now.'' `` I can afford to take the family for a day trip to a safari park near <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fuji </LOCATION>,'' he says. `` But my wife says she wants to eat out every night.'' Hotels across <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> report room shortages during the week because of the Japanese influx, especially in popular destinations such as <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and even <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, until recently suffering from a hotel glut. `` To make matters worse, some hotels in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> are becoming disenchanted with tour groups, the mode of travel particularly favored by the Japanese,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keizai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s main economic newspaper. `` They are starting to focus on individual guests, where the profit margins are higher and the noise level is lower.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> investigators say they've discovered at least two `` silence-for-money'' deals between builders of a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> nuclear power plant and workers who received payments in return for dropping allegations of safety hazards. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on nuclear regulation said Tuesday it is widening its investigation to determine the frequency and legality of these secret deals. `` It's beginning to look like something that's throughout the industry,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, an aide to Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., the subcommittee chairman The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which licenses commercial nuclear power stations and enforces safety rules, has not commented publicly on the acceptability of agreements that limit a plant worker's ability to raise safety issues. In private notices to all nuclear plant operators and vendors, however, the commission last week said such restrictions were not acceptable under any circumstances. It asked the companies to notify the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> of any such deals by July 31. `` It is not acceptable to include in settlement agreements for discrimination matters ... or in any labor agreements or other agreement ... any restrictions on employees or former employees providing information to any members of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>,'' said the notice. A copy was obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>, a commission spokesman, said the letters were sent in response to concerns raised by one of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> nuclear plant deals cited by <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>'s panel. <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> said such agreements hold frightening implications for nuclear safety. `` It turns the licensing process into a sham if witnesses can be paid money to withhold their testimony,'' he said. The panel has scheduled a hearing Thursday to hear from parties to one of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> agreements, and from <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who was not involved in the deals. <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> has blasted <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> commissioners for not publicly condemning the agreements. Subcommittee sources, speaking on condition they not be identified further, said documents indicated <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Macktal </PERSON>, a former electrical foreman at the Comanche Peak nuclear station, received $ 35,000 for himself and his attorneys in a January 1987 agreement with the plant's builder, <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Root. They said the deal barred Macktal from testifying to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> regarding his concerns about plant safety. <PERSON> Macktal </PERSON> contends in a new complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that he signed the deal under duress. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> & amp; Root, in a statement from its <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> headquarters, said the payment to <PERSON> Macktal </PERSON> and his attorneys was in settlement of an earlier complaint he made to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that he was forced to quit because he had questioned <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Root's quality controls at Comanche Peak. The payment was meant to limit litigation costs, the company said. The company acknowledged that the deal prevents Macktal from appearing as a witness before the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, but it said the intent of this provision was to protect the company from `` the need to defend against'' his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> complaint in another forum. It said <PERSON> Macktal </PERSON> had ample opportunity to provide any safety information to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> prior to signing the deal. The first of two reactors at Comanche Peak is 99 percent complete and its owner, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is expected to apply for a low-power license next year. The other reactor at the site, near <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, is 85 percent complete. <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Democrat, said the Macktal agreement came to light after the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s atomic safety and licensing board had ended its Comanche Peak hearings last July. Subcommittee sources said the panel has documented another case at Comanche Peak in which a worker who had raised safety concerns received $ 30,000 as part of a deal with <ORGANIZATION> Gibbs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a contractor at the plant site. They said the arrangement prohibits the employee, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Polizzi </PERSON>, from testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> about safety issues. At <ORGANIZATION> Gibbs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> said she was not familiar with the case and no company official was immediately available to comment. The subcommittee also is investigating a contractor-worker agreement involving the Millstone nuclear power station at <LOCATION> Waterford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, the sources said. No details were provided.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of public water systems across the country will have to improve their purification equipment to reduce chemical contamination and comply with new <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> standards. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday proposed federally required ceilings on the maximum amounts of 38 types of cancer-causing chemicals and other pollutants allowed in drinking water. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> office which deals with drinking water contaminants, said most public water systems already meet the proposed requirements, but additional purification equipment will probably be needed in about 2,500 public systems, serving about 2 million people, mostly in rural areas. In some cases households will be paying higher water bills _ anywhere from $ 10 to $ 460 more a year _ as a result, officials said, although the new requirements in many cases are unlikely to go into effect until 1991. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said the size of consumer cost increases will depend on the size of the water system and the contaminant and treatment technology involved. Affected systems account for about 3 percent of all the public water systems in the country, according to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. Private well water is not covered by the regulations. In addition, officials operating about 80,000 water systems likely will have to increase monitoring activities to comply with the new rules. The new regulations require that local water officials regularly monitor the level of pollutants and make public whenever the levels exceed the federal standard. The proposed regulations will not go into effect until a routine comment period, likely about 90 days, and then the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> will give local water officials another 18 months before the tighter requirements take effect. In some cases where economic hardship can be shown, water officials will be given additional time to comply. The federal standards on the 38 chemicals, including many widely used pesticides and other highly toxic carcinogens, would bring the number of chemicals on which federal standards have either been proposed or are in effect to 55. Three years ago <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> directed <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to set maximum allowable levels on 83 chemicals and other toxic pollutants, but agency officials said Tuesday they will not be able to meet the congressionally imposed June 1 deadline on 28 of them. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said development of federal standards on the remaining 28 is likely to take another year as maximum safe levels and water treatment techniques are worked out. `` If we had more money and manpower we could have sped those up,'' said <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. The proposed standards announced Tuesday cover 17 pesticides including alachlor, aldicarb and atrazine, which are widely used in agriculture; 11 synthetic organic chemicals that have been found to cause cancer or damage to the nervous system; and eight inorganic chemicals, including asbestos, mercury, cadmium, nitrates and nitrites; and two chemicals used to treat drinking water. The requirements `` are important steps in the continuing effort to assure that Americans have the safest drinking water in the world,'' said <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. But some <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> critics maintained that the regulations, while slow in coming, are also too weak. <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said the maximum levels required by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> are significantly higher than ceilings already required by a number of states. Furthermore, she said, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is lifting some water pollutant standards, including the ones for aluminum and silver. Both pose health risks, she said.

 A 78-year-old man has pleaded guilty to strangling his wife of 56 years, saying the ailing woman's demands drove him to the breaking point. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Garfinkle </PERSON> pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter Monday in the Jan. 21 death of his 84-year-old wife, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON>, in their home. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> said she doubted Common Pleas Court Judge <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Richette </PERSON> will sentence <PERSON> Garfinkle </PERSON> to jail. No sentencing date has been set. `` I do not see the need for a jail sentence for this man,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Garfinkle </PERSON> `` was very sick and he just snapped.'' <PERSON> Garfinkle </PERSON>, a retired paperhanger who now lives in a retirement home, said his last 26 years of marriage were torture. At the time of her death, Mrs. <PERSON> Garfinkle </PERSON> was bedridden, deaf, and blind in one eye. She continued to suffer the effects of a serious stomach operation, which left her dependent on her husband. After pleading guilty, <PERSON> Garfinkle </PERSON> recalled his wife's demands: `` Complain, complain, complain. ... ` Harry, give me this. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, get me that.''' He also recalled that after strangling his wife with a necktie, he told her, `` Frances, what did you make me do this for?'' The judge gave <PERSON> Garfinkle </PERSON> a Bible and told him to read it every night, but he said later he would n't because `` the letters are too small.'' `` I do n't believe in anything anymore,'' he said. `` If there's a Lord up there, why did he let it go on for so long?'' <PERSON> Garfinkle </PERSON> said the couple's four children did not blame him for the killing. At Monday's hearing, one son, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Garfinkle </PERSON>, told the judge his mother was `` extremely demanding, and, at the end, she did n't really know how demanding she was.'' The father said if he could live his life again, he would not get married. The day of the slaying, he recalled, his wife's right foot was severely swollen, she could no longer control her bladder and she was in pain. She asked her husband when he was going to make breakfast. `` That was it,'' <PERSON> Garfinkle </PERSON> recalled. `` I just exploded. You just come to the breaking point. She drove me to it.'' After strangling his wife, <PERSON> Garfinkle </PERSON> said, he swallowed 17 sleeping pills in an attempt to kill himself. At first, he lied to police, telling them Mrs. <PERSON> Garfinkle </PERSON> had fallen out of her bed and that he had found her dead. Later, he confessed. `` I pitied her so,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bush Urges US Allies to Denounce `Massive Election Fraud' in Panama</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is keeping his options open on how to deal with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> once it holds its election, which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials predict will be rife with fraud. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday urged <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s neighbors and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to `` speak out against election fraud in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'' as he stepped up the rhetoric against the country's defacto ruler, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s advisers have been working on policy options to employ after Sunday's election, and `` no option has been ruled out,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. However, this official and others have acknowledged that one possibility is remote _ that of military intervention by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which maintains a hefty military presence along the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. They also say there is scant chance the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will renew the offer it made to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> a year ago _ to abandon federal drug-trafficking charges against him if he leaves <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The drug case began the slide in the once-cozy U.S.-Panama relationship. Economic and trade sanctions instituted last year under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> have been extended by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but have failed to loosen <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s grip on the country. On Tuesday, the president told a Latin-oriented business group, the Council of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> that, `` It is evident that the regime is ready to resort to massive election fraud in order to remain in power. The <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime continues to threaten and intimidate Panamanians who believe in democracy. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not recognize the results of a fraudulent election engineered simply to keep <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in power.'' While attempting to discredit the election ahead of time by saying that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has rigged it to ensure victory for his presidential candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, the administration has not declared what post-election pressures it might bring to bear. `` Much will depend on what the Panamanians do,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source. The official noted that an anti-Noriega fervor that was building last year among the people seems to have lost its momentum. Whether such sentiment is manifested again after the election will no doubt influence the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position, the official said. In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a spokesman for the pro-Noriega Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, said the opposition is demoralized `` and they know they are going to lose the election.'' He said they sent `` an SOS to the White House.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also on Tuesday criticized the election plans being laid by the leftist Sandinista government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. He outlined guidelines by which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will judge whether the Nicaraguan elections next February are free and fair, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> must allow outside observers to have access to all election places and proceedings. `` It means a secret ballot on election day, the freedom to campaign, to organize, to hold rallies and to poll public opinion, to operate independent radio and TV stations as well,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Business Groups Complain About Workers' Insurance Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Business representatives contend that American workers would be better off if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> repealed a new law aimed at barring health-insurance discrimination against lower-paid employees. `` We remain skeptical that it does anything to improve or extend coverage of health care,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, a Californian speaking for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> legislation to revise the law would be an improvement, but that the best course would be outright repeal. `` It will still be a new impediment and disincentive to employers, especially smaller employers, to provide health insurance,'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. Similar objections were raised by other business representatives who testified before the tax panel. But spokesmen for the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> and the accounting profession leaned toward revising the law, known as Internal Revenue Code Section 89, rather than repealing it. `` Prompt congressional action is needed to alleviate the problems employers are experiencing in complying with Section 89,'' said <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trier </PERSON>, tax legislative counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We believe the -LRB- revision -RRB- bill represents a major step forward in achieving these goals.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> advocates a complete revision of present law, which he called a complicated mess. The law, enacted in 1986, aims to ensure that tax-deductible health insurance plans do not discriminate in favor of higher-paid employees. The statute requires employers to subject their health plans to complex tests to determine whether they discriminate. Some employers say the complexity, paperwork and cost _ $ 50 per worker, by one estimate _ are so onerous that they will find it easier to drop their health plans rather than try to comply with the law. Business has made repeal or modification of the law a major goal this year. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has heard so many complaints that 300 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members and close to a majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have signed bills to repeal the law. Most members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> have signed the revision bill, whose chief sponsor is Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill. The complaints have been heard by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, too. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> announced Monday that employers would not have to test their health plans for compliance before Oct. 1; the law originally had a Jan. 1, 1989, deadline. The federal government forgoes more than $ 30 billion a year in taxes on the value of employer-financed health coverage. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>'s bill would eliminate most of the complicated testing by requiring employers to provide to at least 90 percent of their lower-paid workers health insurance costing the employees no more than $ 10 a month for a single plan or no more than $ 25 for family coverage. <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, legislative representative for the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, praised <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>'s bill but said the labor federation questions whether it would make it possible for working families to qualify for coverage. He recommended that a worker's out-of-pocket spending for medical expenses be limited to $ 3,000 a year and that the $ 25-a-week maximum premium under the bill be reduced. The committee was asked to provide special exemptions for state and local governments, since such employers pay no federal taxes and, thus, receive no tax deduction for the costs of workers' insurance <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, speaking for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION>, said at least 27 states require workers to pay more than $ 10 a week for a single health policy or more than $ 25 weekly for a family plan. Overall, <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> said, while congressional concern about the $ 30-billion-a-year subsidy for health plans is understandable, `` We believe that the burdens of the law far outweigh the benefits in the public sector.''

<HEAD>Rehnquist Urges Congress to Raise Judges' Salaries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today to give the nation's federal judges an immediate 30 percent pay raise. Calling inadequate salaries `` the most serious threat to the future of the judiciary,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> sought support for legislation providing the raise and regular cost-of-living adjustments. `` This is not, in my view, fairly termed a pay raise,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said in a prepared statement to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is instead a partial recapture of the tremendous decline in purchasing power that has affected judicial salaries over the last 20 years.'' A 30 percent pay increase would boost the chief justice's annual salary from $ 115,000 to $ 149,500. Salaries of <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices would rise from $ 110,000 to $ 143,000; appeals court judges from $ 95,000 to $ 123,500; and trial judges from $ 89,500 to $ 116,500. There are about 700 active federal judges. About 300 others are on senior status, meaning they do as much or as little work as they wish. All receive the same raises. As chief justice, <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, heads the federal judiciary and chairs the policy-making <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Judicial Conference. He said the Judicial Conference recognizes there was `` widespread public opposition'' to a defeated proposal for a 51 percent pay raise for senior government officials, including members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and federal judges. `` We believe, however, that a smaller increase of 30 percent for federal judges is both publicly acceptable and fully justified,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said. The chief justice also emphasized the importance of routine cost-of-living adjustments in judicial salaries, which he said `` could well obviate the need for the sort of sizable ` catch-up' increases'' being proposed Currently, federal judges receive the periodic raises given to most federal employees by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' historical reluctance to increase its own pay levels has often meant that cost-of-living increases for other senior government officials have also been denied,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said. Under the legislation backed by the <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, cost-of-living raises for judges would not be tied to similar raises for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Despite <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>'s complaint about infrequent cost-of-living increases, federal judges have received them in most years since 1975. During that period, district court salaries have risen from $ 42,000 to $ 89,500 and appellate court salaries from $ 44,600 to $ 95,000. Last week, five Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> courts subcommittee advised a panel of leading judges that public protests would likely block any judicial pay raise unless non-working seniors judges were excluded. The judges opposed such limits. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year reported previously unpublished federal figures showing that in 1987 some 20 percent of the then-306 senior judges did no judicial work, including former Chief Justice <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON>, D-Wis., and Rep. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moorhead </PERSON>, R-Calif., chairman and ranking minority member on the subcommittee, subsequently submitted legislation to bar pay raises other than cost-of-living increases from senior judges who carry less than 25 percent of an active judge's But they also agreed, at the judges' request, to submit a bill calling for the general 30 percent raise and annual cost-of-living increases. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed a 25 percent increase along with a ban on speaking fees and a limit on outside earned income. The judges oppose both the ban and the limit.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> concluded its annual gathering with a rousing call to arms by outgoing <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> to resist government intrusion into radio and TV. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, who led the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s repeal of the `` fairness doctrine'' that required broadcasters to present opposing views of public issues, said Tuesday that broadcasting has a constitutional duty to express opinions. `` You are all members of the press, no less than the editorial boards of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and The Wall Street Journal,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said. `` We, the members of the public, want to hear what you have to say, we deserve to know your opinions.'' But, he added, `` You are powerful, and for that reason we in government have just cause to fear you.'' At the same time, he said, government has `` no cause to attempt to regulate your speech. Stand firm against any attempt to do so.'' Even though the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> lifted the fairness doctrine from broadcasters in 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is almost sure to reinstate it this year, posing a veto fight with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and a likely Supreme Court test. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s speech outlining the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s accomplishments was interrupted a number of times by applause from the broadcasters and exhibitors who descended on this gambling mecca for a four-day meeting. <ORGANIZATION> NAB </ORGANIZATION> said there were a record 50,136 registrants this year, and 709 exhibitors plied a wide range of broadcasting hardware. High-definition television predominated, with more than 22,000 square feet of exhibit space and numerous technical and regulatory panel discussions devoted to the multibillion-dollar television of the future. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> thanked his audience for their `` unflagging support'' of his policies against a hostile <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and non-broadcast media during his six years at the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have tried to foster competition at the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> by lowering barriers to entry, and by permitting broadcasters to compete as freely as those with whom they compete _ namely cable,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> announced last month he had resigned from the agency, where he has been chairman for the past two years, but would stay on until his replacement is confirmed. The 37-year-old <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> native said he would leave government, but has announced no future plans. In addition to repealing the fairness doctrine, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> during <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s tenure reinstated rules giving broadcasters exclusive rights to programming in their broadcasting areas over cable outlets, he said. He advocated further protection from the cable TV industry through a requirement that cable systems pay for the over-the-air programs they feed to their subscribers. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> noted how the FCC revised the means by which stations renew their licenses to bar sham competitors who just want money to drop their challenges to a station's license. And he noted the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision last year to make sure that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standard for high-definition television will not render obsolete the huge investment TV stations have in current equipment. American industry is racing to adopt standards with which to build an HDTV system and stave off the expected appearance in the next couple of years of foreign-made HDTV VCRs and movies. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said broadcasters still faced many challenges: fiber-optic cable and telephone entry into video programming; competition from foreign media; further loss of audience; the shifting of advertising from video to point of sales.

<HEAD>Business, Education Committee Calls for Cap on Liability Judgments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 States should set guidelines for awards in damage suits because juries are blind to the impact their liability judgments have beyond the courtroom, an organization of business executives and educators said today. `` The benefits are immediate and visible: compensation to an often tragically injured individual who is present in the courtroom,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said in a 176-page report by its Research and <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` In contrast, the magnitude of the costs and the bearer of those costs are largely invisible,'' the CED said. The committee recommended adoption of statutory guidelines based on such formulas as replacement of two-thirds of the plaintiff's wages, which it said is roughly full replacement of after-tax earnings `` Future wage loss for children could be calculated at the median annual earnings in the state,'' the panel said. `` Similar general principles should be applied for calculating compensation for medical, rehabilitation, and special educational expenses.'' `` A fundamental flaw of setting the terms of a social insurance program through the courts is that the jury has neither the information nor the incentives to weigh the costs of its decisions against the benefits,'' the committee said. It said one study showed that between 1960 and 1984, the average jury verdict in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, increased by more than 300 percent in 1984 dollars after adjustment for inflation. The CED describes itself as a nonprofit, nonpartisan and nonpolitical educational organization of more than 200 business executives and educators seeking to formulate policies to foster economic growth and an improved standard of living. The panel said the current liability system `` neither effectively deters nor efficiently compensates'' and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should relay more heavily on alternative methods of dispute resolution. In addition to increasing legal fees, court awards and insurance costs, the present system results in indirect cots to Americans in higher prices, withdrawn goods and services and damaged international competitiveness, the study said. It called for a limit on punitive damages, a uniform federal law on product liability, and more reliance on regulation to control environmental and chemical hazards. It said workers' compensation should be revised and made the sole recourse for injuries and diseases of the workplace. It also called for prohibiting lawsuits when a product complies with regulation, except in cases of fraud or suppression of evidence. It proposed a ban on liability for risks that could not be anticipated at the time the product was manufactured. `` Punitive damages should be awarded only in cases of willful misconduct and should be limited to a modest multiple of the compensatory award,'' the committee said. It said this would preserve `` incentives for prudent attention to risk'' while avoiding exposure to `` unpredictable and potentially bankrupting punitive awards.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will spell out the conclusions of his wide-ranging foreign policy review in the next few weeks in a series of commencement addresses dealing with <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> relations, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, the White House says. `` Basically it will point out the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> view of the world and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' role in it and our attitude toward other countries,'' White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` There will be some differences with existing policy although the general thrust will not be too different,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` It's not clear to me there will ever be any written reports'' about the review, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` These speeches may in effect be the most definitive enunciation of the results of that review.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is scheduled to give five commencement speeches this month, beginning with a May 12 address at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the topic of that speech will be foreign policy, although it is not clear what the focus will be. A May 21 speech at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> will spell out <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s view of East-West relations and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategy for dealing with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. Then, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will use a May 24 speech at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, to discuss the strength of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the future of the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. Two days later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will fly to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on the first leg of a four-nation trip and a full <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit May 29-30. In recent days, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has been shaken by a dispute over modernization of short-range nuclear weapons stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speeches will follow on the heels of next week's trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> for talks with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s trip is expected to produce a date for resumption of negotiations to cut back long-range nuclear weapons and explore possibilities for a summit sometime this year between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The arms talks went into recess late last year and were expected to resume in February, but were put off by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pending completion of the foreign policy reviews. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit and a seven-nation economic summit in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in July will give further definition to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s policies With the first 100 days of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s administration completed, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the next three months will concentrate heavily on foreign policy objectives.

 When President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> travels to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, he gets there quicker than <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> but slower than <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. That's because <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has eliminated one link in the trip used by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ a fast helicopter ride into <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> from a nearby airport, usually <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. Instead, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prefers to travel within <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by motorcade. And that means he must land at the most distant of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s three major airports _ Kennedy Closer-in <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> wo n't accommodate Air Force One, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707. And he ca n't use <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, for security and national defense reasons. A motorcade trip from <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> would require the president's motorcade to pass through a tunnel under the river, and that would put the chief executive out of radio contact with the rest of the world _ unless special communications cables were laid through the tunnel, deemed by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> not worth the expense or effort So <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has been to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> twice as president, travels through the nation's most populous city entirely by motorcade _ producing monumental traffic tie-ups as he goes. For last Sunday's trip, when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> participated in a re-enactment of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s inauguration 200 years before, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> traveled by motorcade all the way from <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to Wall Street in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, a trip of about 35 minutes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision not to use a helicopter to get into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was based on `` his preference to save money,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. `` At a time when we're facing budgetary constraints, it's one way he could have an impact,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said it was not clear how much was really saved by such a step, however. Usually, four helicopters were involved when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> traveled from <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, usually to a helipad at the Battery _ one helicopter for the president and his top aides, one for the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, another for lesser-ranking staff, and a press chopper. At least some of the helicopters had to be flown up from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. However, official motorcades through <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are, to say it mildly, interesting. They are sometimes chaotic, hectic, frightening, exhilarating _ and always gridlock-forming. As president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gets streets barricaded for him along the motorcade route. That presents an unusual sight to anyone familiar with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s usually clogged streets _ block after block of temporarily empty pavement. Of course, side streets and entrance ramps along the way become hopelessly clogged with stopped traffic. As vice president, and as a candidate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't always rate such treatment, and his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> motorcades often had to vie with and fend off other traffic. Sirens and flashing lights seem to have less effect on traffic in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> than in other cities. Cars, buses and cabs frequently dart in and out of the path of non-presidential motorcades. When a motorcade slows down too much, or too much of a gap opens between cars, pedestrians and bicyclists often stream perilously across the street between the gaps. During a campaign visit last spring, a vehicle in then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s motorcade struck a cab trying to edge into the flow of traffic, crumpling its side. The motorcade kept moving, the cab driver shaking his fist and hurling epithets. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> motorcades `` usually produce a higher percentage of hand and finger gestures,'' asserts one White House staff member. Is saving the cost of helicopters worth the added cost of more police officers along motorcade routes, and the jangled nerves of those caught in traffic jams? `` You have to try to strike a balance,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. And, he noted, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> only took choppers from the airport into the city _ he still had to travel by motorcade within <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Although it takes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> longer than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to get to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> site, he's still a lot swifter than the nation's first president _ whose steps <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> retraced last Sunday. It took <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> a week in 1789 to travel from <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> near what is now the nation's capital, to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which was then the nation's capital. And he did it by horseback, coach and barge.

<TEXT>
 Students in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> traditionally have looked to the West for models of democracy, but this time they also are inspired by currents of change across the border in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. These Chinese see President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies of `` glasnost,'' or greater openness, as an example they would like their country's leaders to follow. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> share similar histories of autocratic government, state repression and socialist economic stagnation. In recent years, both countries have launched market-oriented reforms aimed at modernizing their economies and raising living standards to meet citizens' growing expectations. Economic liberalization under senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> has brought relative prosperity to millions of Chinese. However, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has refused to imitate <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s political reforms, which have allowed unprecedented open debate in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> over sensitive political issues. Only on the student-established `` free-speech platforms'' in the streets of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> during the past two weeks have Chinese tasted anything approaching glasnost. There, students and workers alike have engaged in heated debates over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political history, economic problems and growing official corruption. Thousands of pro-democracy protesters have taken to the streets since mid-April and more demonstrations loomed after the government today turned down a student demand that new independent student unions be recognized. The students' demands that the government end official privilege, nepotism and profiteering have especially struck a raw nerve among many Chinese who are angered by 30 percent inflaction and blatant displays of ill-gotten wealth. The workers who joined the students in last week's triumphant march through <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s streets said the leadership's refusal to enact democratic reforms and allow the press to freely speak out against abuse of privilege are partly to blame for the country's economic woes `` Sure, there's been some improvement, and I do better than most people,'' said taxi driver <PERSON> Zheng </PERSON> <PERSON> Jun </PERSON>. `` But the leadership's rotten to the core, and it's incompetent too. `` There should be a way for the ordinary people to reach the government with their problems,'' he said. Chinese dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, in a recent essay, alluded to the Soviet example when he called for `` use of open glasnost-style means to root out corruption.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has said political reform, meaning a shrinking of its role in government and business, will take a decade, and that it will be at least 20 to 30 years before national elections are possible _ a slow process the students want to accelerate. `` The Soviets are ahead of us. At least they have elections,'' said another <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> resident. `` Maybe when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> comes to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on May 15 we can demonstrate and get his help,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Qiang </PERSON>. While they have turned to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for support and ideas, the students' concepts of democracy and freedom were inherited from an earlier generation of Chinese intellectuals, many of whom studied at the <LOCATION> Sorbonne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and returned to spearhead protests in their homeland. Chinese who studied in the West played key roles in the May 4, 1919 student pro-democracy movement and in the Communist revolution. The t students, who want fundamental reform of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s tightly controlled political system and an end to widespread corruption, se Western democracies as models frotests, freedom of speech and the press, and democracy _ views shared by many Chinese Numerous students said American student protests in the 1960s against the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War inspired them to take to te streets, despite the fact thamerica at that time was <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s No. 1 enemy. `` Do n't American students protest, too?'' they asked repeatedl Few expect concrete support for their efforts from abroad, but they did welcome news of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> State Departmtatement May 26 that said: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes in and supports the right of peaceful ly, including peaceful protest and the freedom onot only in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but around the world.'' The students repeatedly ask journalists to report the news of thts accurately `` to let the world know what is happening in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' one student said, `` and so other countries can support us.'' `` We want support from around the world, said another.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has quietly rescinded a nine-year-old ban on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel attending Soviet functions celebrating May Day and other occasions. The decision, disclosed Tuesday by defense sources and confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, was announced in a memorandum dated April 27 that was distributed throughout the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military. The memo states <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> had lifted `` restrictions on attendance by <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> personnel at Soviet receptions or other functions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to mark May Day or Victory in Europe Day, imposed after the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'' in December 1979. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, said the decision simply reflected the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s recent withdrawal of troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and nothing more. A similar restriction on high-level <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> personnel was lifted in mid-February, according to administration sources. That was why <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> viewed the May Day festivities in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Monday from the official diplomatic review stand _ the first time that has been done in 10 years, the sources said. According to Cmdr. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundin </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, active-duty and civilian defense officials were specifically barred in early 1980 from accepting invitations to functions tied to four key Soviet military observances _ Soviet National Day in November; Armed Forces Day in February; May Day on May 1; and Victory in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> Day on May 9. The ban was imposed by the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration just after the invasion and has been `` rigidly enforced ever since,'' said one defense official who requested anonymity. The first change in that enforcement occurred last November when some restrictions were relaxed governing Soviet National Day and Armed Forces Day observances, <PERSON> Sundin </PERSON> said. At the time, the Soviets had agreed under <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> auspices to withdraw their troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Now that the withdrawal is complete, `` <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has lifted all the restrictions,'' <PERSON> Sundin </PERSON> added. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>'s decision was disclosed just a few days after he made headlines by predicting <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to overhaul the Soviet economy would fail <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who got the Russian troops out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, is likely to fail with his restructuring efforts and be replaced by a leader `` far more hostile'' to the West, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said in a TV interview broadcast last Saturday.

 <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouvier </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> is not the frail, whispery-voiced woman the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people saw standing by the side of President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, says the author of an unauthorized biography of the former first lady. The real <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>, says writer <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Heymann </PERSON>, is a strong-willed woman who was probably a principal designer of the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> administration's Camelot image. `` The image of this good Catholic husband with two beautiful children and a beautiful wife posing on the White House lawn was not the case,'' he said. In his book, `` A Woman Named <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>,'' which went on sale Tuesday, <PERSON> Heymann </PERSON> attempted to unravel the life and character of one of the world's most admired, photographed and written-about yet enigmatic women. `` Although there have been so many things written about her, nothing I read really did the woman justice,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` Everything was based on gossip and innuendo. I felt something along definite lines should be written.'' His 631-page book is based on interviews with 825 people, including friends, employees and family members, but none of the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedys </ORGANIZATION>. The author, by appealing to the director of Presidential Libraries in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, gained access to the former first lady's <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> social files. Through the Freedom of Information Act, he obtained thousands of pages of previously undisclosed <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> files. <PERSON> Heymann </PERSON>'s purpose was not to document the public successes and failures of the <PERSON> Kennedys </PERSON>' years in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but to scrutinize their successes and failures as individuals _ as husband and wife. Indeed, a good portion of the book is devoted to the slain president's many alleged liaisons with women. `` A lot of this was n't my original intention to go into his affairs in such depth,'' said <PERSON> Heymann </PERSON>. `` I had merely heard all the rumors and innuendo. But, as a result of digging into various files, ... a lot of this became fact not merely rumor. Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>' spokeswoman, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuckerman </PERSON>, has said Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> would not comment on the book. A telephone message left at her office Tuesday was not returned. According to <PERSON> Heymann </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> once sneaked out of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hotel for a sexual liaison without telling the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and without taking the list of codes he needed in the event of a nuclear attack. <PERSON> Langdon </PERSON> <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former defense consultant to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> who had accompanied him on the jaunt, was quoted in the book as saying, `` The Russians could have bombed us to hell and back, and there would have been nothing we could have done about it.'' The date of the alleged incident was not given. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> died in 1987, according to <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodner </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the publisher, <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Heymann </PERSON> wrote that Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who married <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in 1953, responded to her husband's sexual dalliances by being `` glacially cold'' toward him and going on spending sprees. `` It was at these junctures that she went on shopping binges, disbursing thousands of dollars on jewelry, designer clothes, paintings; whatever captured her fancy,'' he wrote. After the August 1963 death of the <PERSON> Kennedys </PERSON>' third child, when the boy was just 3 days old, the couple seemed to grow closer in their grief, <PERSON> Heymann </PERSON> wrote. But Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s life was shattered on Nov. 22, 1963, in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> when her husband was assassinated while riding with her in a motorcade. <PERSON> Heymann </PERSON> wrote that the first lady refused to take a sedative as she waited in her blood-splattered outfit at Parkland Memorial Hospital. `` I do n't want a sedative,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> reportedly said. `` I want to be with my husband when he dies.''

<HEAD>Explosives-Detection Bill Advances In House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bill that would give airlines and airports $ 270 million for devices to detect plastic explosives goes before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee Thursday, after a subcommittee rejected Republican efforts to make airlines pay half the cost. The legislation requires installation of the sophisticated units in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and foreign airports that are considered vulnerable to terrorists. It does the same thing as a <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> order last month, which would have airlines pay the full cost of the units. The bill, passed Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>, would take the $ 270 million from an aviation trust fund without budgeting new money. The fund has accumulated more than $ 6 billion in fees collected from airline passengers for airport improvements. Republicans tried to amend the measure to require that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines pay half the cost, but the bill received no opposing votes when it passed with full federal funding for the security devices. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last month ordered airlines to install the sophisticated bomb-detection machines at high-risk airports. Both the order and the legislation call for detection systems such as thermal neutron devices that have been tested by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said Tuesday he expects the first machine to be installed in July at <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> F. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the second at an airport in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. He said several more should be in place before the end of the year. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> last week meeting with officials of other governments about aviation security as a result of the Dec. 21 bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> that killed 270 people. He said the administration feels the airlines should pay for additional security, using revenue from security fees collected with passengers' tickets. The legislation would provide up to 100 percent grants to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines and airports which would own, operate and maintain the detection units expected to cost about $ 1 million each. The airline grants also would cover installation in high-risk foreign airports. Subcommittee chairman Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., argued that the government should pay for the devices that would examine checked-in baggage because the government, not airlines, has been the target of terrorists Other governments will be paying for security units used by their airlines, which would put them at a competitive advantage, <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON> said. Republicans argued that airlines have always paid for security equipment at airports, and the subsidy could lead to other moves to use federal money to help airlines.

 American agents are `` plugged into the underworld'' of illegal diversion of deadly chemical weapons materials, but their successes are being undermined by the courts, says the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customs commissioner. `` The penalties we have are there,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at a hearing Tuesday on the illegal export of biological agents and other material used to make chemical weapons. `` The problem is judges do n't apply them.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, through informants and various sting operations, has controlled to some degree the diversion of the materials to terrorist nations, von <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. `` With the volume we're dealing with, I do n't think we're losing a lot,'' he said. `` We're pretty well plugged into the underworld.'' However, the effort by the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been thwarted by the judicial system, which has failed to impose stiffer penalties, von <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. The commissioner described the case of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Walaschek </PERSON>, a West German national arrested for purchasing three orders of thiodiglycol, a precursor for mustard gas, from <ORGANIZATION> Alcolac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, for shipment to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. The shipments were re-exported to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Customs agents, suspicious of <PERSON> Walaschek </PERSON>'s third order, told inspectors in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to seize the chemical and replace it with water. The agents then tracked the shipment of water to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>; and then <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walaschek </PERSON> was arrested on July 27, 1988, in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and pleaded guilty to violating the Export Administration Act. He admitted that he purchased the chemical at the request of <PERSON> Sayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kharim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobhani </PERSON>, an Iranian diplomat stationed at his country's embassy in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. But under protests from the government, <PERSON> Walaschek </PERSON> was placed in a halfway house. He later fled and is currently a fugitive in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said another part of the problem is that the criminals give the impression of being average businessmen. `` They look normal, they've done normal things _ offering and accepting merchandise _ but what they're dealing with is poison,'' the commissioner said. The chemical industry is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' largest international trading industry with total shipments in 1988 at $ 238 billion, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Current export controls apply to 40 of an estimated 20,000 commercially traded chemicals and chemical products.

<HEAD>Air Force Gives More Details on B-2</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A top <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> general has offered a surprising amount of detail about the new B-2 stealth bomber, disclosing it will have great range, an ability to land almost anywhere and a payload of 25 tons of bombs. The plane's capabilities will be such that had the B-2 been available in 1986, when <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> bombers attacked <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, `` just three to four B-2s could have done the job direct from stateside bases,'' said Gen. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. More than 100 combat and support aircraft from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> were used for that bombing mission. The B-2 would require at most two tankers to fuel it during the mission, <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON>, in making his revelations last weekend, said little about the cost of the B-2 or of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s recent budget decision to postpone the start of production by a full year But he asserted to a meeting of aviation reporters in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, that the B-2 was nothing less than a `` quantum leap into the 21st century'' that was essential to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future strength, thanks to its ability to slip behind enemy lines without being detected on radar. <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> appeared before the reporters on Saturday. A text of his remarks was released later at the Pentagon. Not only is the B-2 destined to become a key part of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s nuclear arsenal, but it offers a capability to deliver conventional weapons that is unmatched among manned bombers, <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> said The Libyan bombing raid `` could have been conducted with greater tactical surprise and vastly less risk of life,'' he said. Among <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON>'s disclosures:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ The B-2 will be capable of flying more than 6,000 nautical miles _ or 6,900 statute miles _ without refueling With one mid-air refueling, it will be able to fly more than 10,000 nautical miles or 11,500 statute miles. _ The plane will have a maximum takeoff weight of more than 350,000 pounds and will be able to carry up to 50,000 pounds of either nuclear or conventional bombs Specifically, it will be able to carry 16 large nuclear weapons, 20 smaller nuclear bombs, or up to 80 conventional 500-pound bombs. The B-52, the mainstay strategic bomber, carries 60,000 tons of bombs. _ The plane is designed to operate with minimal support equipment and can land on any runway that's just 40 feet wide, meaning `` it can operate from any airfield that can handle a 727 commercial airliner. `` With one air refueling, operating from just four bases _ two stateside and two overseas _ the B-2 could cover any point on the world's land mass on a non-stop radius mission carrying a full conventional payload,'' <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> said. `` Those possibilities could deter a great deal of adventurism.'' <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> also announced the first flight of the B-2 would probably occur in about two months, but only when the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> was convinced the plane was ready. The B-2, built primarily by <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is a futuristic-looking gray-and black `` flying wing'' designed to evade enemy radar and deliver nuclear weapons. It resembles a huge, tailless manta ray, with wide sweeping wings blending smoothly into a rounded cockpit and engine housings on the top side. The stealth gets its name from the claim that it will be extremely difficult to detect by enemy radar, due to the extensive use of exotic composite materials; its lack of sharp surface angles; and a cross-section that offers a very small profile to radar. Before <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s decision to slow production, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had estimated 132 of the planes would cost $ 68.1 billion. Even if money spent on research and development is set aside, that amounts to production costs of $ 305 million per plane.

 Elections for borough offices never draw long lines at the voting booth, but this year's contests set a new standard for apathy. Candidates outnumbered voters in Monday's election, when only 21 people voted for the 22 candidates. Nearly all the voters were either running for office or were relatives of the candidates. Every two years, the borough, which administers the center of the southwestern <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> town, stages elections that generate little opposition or interest. No political affiliations are noted on the ballot.

Huevos -LRB- Egg -RRB- Circle and Jamon -LRB- Ham -RRB- Lane are some of the street names in the same neighborhood of <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Viejo </ORGANIZATION>, which has grown from scratch to 75,000 people in 23 years. The <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> heritage of the area has inspired some fanciful names for places and streets. The original <ORGANIZATION> Rancho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Viejo </ORGANIZATION> was established under a Spanish land grant. `` The story was told that when they decided to have a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> theme for the community _ <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> walls, Franciscan bells, Spanish-themed architecture _ they decided all streets would have Spanish names,'' said <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetzel </PERSON>, director of corporate communications for the <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Viejo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, professor of <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fullerton </ORGANIZATION>, said some of the names are silly. `` Unfortunately people do n't often have a clear sense of what it means to use another language, so they use it impressionistically,'' <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> said. `` It just sounds ` Spanishy.' The other thing is that people have a tendency to seek the exotic, and foreign names are exotic.'' The race to name streets included one called <LOCATION> Rabida </LOCATION>, -LRB- rabid -RRB-. Other names: Via Fabricante -LRB- Manufacturer Street -RRB-, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charco </LOCATION> -LRB- The Puddle, near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mission </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Viejo </LOCATION> -RRB-, and Via Remolino -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-.

 Civil rights activist <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> says `` questions remain'' over the appointment of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights division, but he supports <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> nonetheless. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> commented after meeting Tuesday with Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, who said later that he had made `` a pitch'' to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> about <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, 61, whose nomination has been opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> revealed his attitude toward <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> only in response to a reporter's questions, and when asked directly whether he supported him, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said only, `` Yes.'' `` I hope that he will honor the trust that the government is putting in him,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I have reason to believe he will.'' The nomination of <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, a black Democrat-turned-Republican who lost a race for governor of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in 1986, has been opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's oldest and largest civil rights group. Also opposing the nomination is Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., who said he was surprised by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support `` I do n't know why Mr. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said what he said,'' said <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> is `` an outstanding human being ... but his public service has been in law enforcement,'' said <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. `` He is better suited for deputy drug czar or deputy <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director, and not as chief policy maker on civil rights enforcement in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in light of no litigatory experience or policy experience, unless you're making the assumption that anybody with black skin has the qualifications,'' said <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, who is black. `` I do n't make that assumption and I find it offensive when people do make that assumption.'' <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> lawyer, has been an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, sheriff of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and the chief executive for that county. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said the assistant attorney general position `` is a law enforcement job and needs someone with a law enforcement background and management background.'' Among those supporting <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> are some members of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> and the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, a black Democrat from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, said a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> fight by civil rights groups to block the <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> nomination `` would be a useless one, maybe even counterproductive.'' He invited members of the caucus to meet informally with <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> on Tuesday afternoon. The nominee spent more than an hour with seven members of the 23-member caucus. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said one of the main reasons he visited <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was to fight for the rights of sugar cane workers from <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and the British <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indies </LOCATION>. `` Because the sugar cane growers have lobbied to exempt sugar cane as a perishable product, they are less eligible to get their green cards and are therefore denied access to citizenship in this country,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also criticized public housing officials who, following the leadership of Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, are evicting innocent people when one family member is involved with drugs. `` I talked to a mother today who has lived in an apartment for 24 years and her son was arrested _ not arrested, indicted, tried and convicted, just arrested _ and her furniture is on the street,'' he said. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to talk with <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> about the situation. A <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> `` has been quite cautious in deciding where waivers should be granted on federal administrative rules regarding evictions. Those waivers will only be granted in those states where the due process rights of the tenants will clearly be protected.''

<TEXT>
 Folks in Zap still shudder when they recall the day 20 years ago when 2,000 drunken college students rioted on Main Street and set a bonfire, causing $ 3,000 in damage. Saturday, a new generation of students plan a sequel. But <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlegel </PERSON>, organizer of Zip to Zap II, promises a more sedate celebration, one she hopes can erase hard feelings that have festered in the town of 300 people since 1969. `` I want to show them that people are different and things like this can work out,'' said the 21-year-old junior at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>. `` We are mending fences in a way.'' The school newspaper, The Spectrum, organized the first Zip to Zap for a spring fling. But chaos erupted that May day and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was called in to disperse the rowdy students. Although many Zap townspeople are apprehensive about college students again invading the quiet hamlet, <PERSON> Schlegel </PERSON>, the editor of The Spectrum, believes Zip to Zap II not only will restore her newspaper's image. It also will provide an economic boon to the town about 90 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>. `` It all started as a Spectrum picnic in Zap 20 years ago,'' she said. `` We have gotten a bad rap from it, and I just want to show that things can work out. People can get together in a gathering and it does n't have to be a disaster. ... I do n't think the drinking is the same as it was 20 years ago.'' <PERSON> Schlegel </PERSON> harbors no fears that Zip to <PERSON> Zap </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> will get out of control, calling today's college students more mature and less radical than their 1960s' counterparts. `` I do n't think we are going to be starting street fires,'' she said. <PERSON> Schlegel </PERSON> expects up to 1,000 students from campuses across <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> to descend on Zap for 11 hours of free rock' n' roll plus some volleyball games. Six bands have volunteered for the show, which starts at 1 p.m. in a pasture near the town, she said. Zap is gearing up to handle 2,000 people, said <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, a civic organization with 20 active members. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, 29, barely remembers the May 10, 1969, event, when she was living with her family in nearby <LOCATION> Beulah </LOCATION>, but said: `` Everybody was scared, seeing it on television.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Mercer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expects to have about 15 officers in Zap on Saturday and <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> officers also will be around, Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Nodland </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` We really do n't foresee that ... it is going to get out of hand,'' he said. Townspeople in Zap are split on whether another batch of college revelers should even be let into town, <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. Some want the town barricaded. `` They harbor the bad memories,'' she said. She does n't expect a repeat of the disturbance but remains cautious. `` When people are intoxicated, moods swing. If we knew this was an annual event, we would know what to prepare for. But with a 20-year gap in it, it leaves anything and everything up in the air,'' <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. The town is hoping to cash in, however. At least seven portable food stands will be set up, <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. And the <ORGANIZATION> Zap </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> had 500 souvenir T-shirts printed with the message: `` I Zipped to Zap and had a blast.''

<HEAD>Soviet Wheat Sale Plan Praised in Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s announced plan to sell 1.5 million metric tons of subsidized wheat to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was praised in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but did n't settle concerns about the future of the export bonus program. Senate Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who had pressed the president to use export subsidies in the Soviet sale, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision Tuesday sends `` a strong signal <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is playing to win in the international marketplace.'' `` This action is welcome news for our farmers,'' he said. `` I applaud it,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Democrat who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grain. `` But in announcing this deal the administration did not quell the concern about the future of the Export Enhancement Program.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said he talked to the president by telephone Monday night and urged him to approve the deal `` There should be grain sales to the Soviets,'' he said. `` I'm a strong supporter of using the Export Enhancement Program when it makes sense.'' Competition in the international wheat market is strong, with many other countries using heavy subsidies to lure buyers. The Export Enhancement Program has been the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response to the competition, but its future has been in doubt. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, following the lead of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, has called for eventual elimination of all export subsidies worldwide, though the president has said he would not do away with <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> unless other countries did likewise. Nevertheless, no EEP sales have been processed since the end of February and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been after the administration to start moving. `` They were reacting to congressional pressure,'' <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> said of the president's announcement. At a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee hearing last month, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said the program had been suspended pending a budget review. In a letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> earlier this week, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` It's clear that any budget review of the program is not an appropriate reason to suspend new offers at this time.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is required to use $ 770 million to finance <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> sales this year. <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> said he still intends to find out what role the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> played in slowing down the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> program. `` The fact of the matter is we are still operating under a cloud started by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration,'' said <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>. `` What I would have liked to have seen is a clear and unequivocal statement about their support for the Export Enhancement Program.'' `` We heard that <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> was arguing against this one,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, D-Neb., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who has been pressuring <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget office for information about the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> slowdown He applauded the decision to sell to the Soviets as good for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It also is a victory for those of us who look for ways to encourage the reforms that -LRB- Soviet President -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is pushing for his nation,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> program involves subsidies to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters in the form of surplus government-owned commodities. The exporters are able to sell grain to a foreign buyer at a reduced price and then collect government surpluses as `` bonuses'' or subsidies to make up the difference. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have been major buyers under the program, with the Soviets buying more than 4 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat for delivery in 1988-89. In addition, the Soviets have bought about 14.6 million unsubsidized tons of corn for 1988-89. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, since the subsidy program began in 1985 it has helped sell more than 81 million tons of grain to all foreign recipients, including about 60 million tons of wheat, plus assorted other products such as frozen poultry, eggs and dairy cattle. In all, the sales are valued at about $ 8.14 billion, with the subsidies costing more than $ 2.5 billion.

<HEAD>ABA Says no Deal with Thornburgh on Judicial Screening</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> misstated the position of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> when he said its judicial screening panel has agreed to stop considering the political and ideological views of candidates for the federal bench, say two leaders of the organization. <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION>, both disagreed Tuesday with <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s description of what has been produced by discussions with the attorney general about judicial screening. The issue is sensitive because <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s choice to be deputy attorney general, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, could face tough questioning by conservative senators about the job he did running the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> screening committee. Also, there are some 50 vacancies on the federal bench. The two <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> officials said there is no agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said the panel has only `` expressed a willingness'' in discussions with <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to delete a clause from the guidelines that says political views and ideology are not considered `` except to the extent that they may bear upon the other factors'' considered by the screening panel. `` I do n't think we have reached any agreement on the exact language'' of any change to be made, <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said. Earlier Tuesday, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> committee during this decade has begun assessing the `` ideological or political views of prospective nominees.'' As a result of discussions, the attorney general said, the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> will `` restrict their examination and assessment only to those areas where they have special expertise.'' `` We are pleased that the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> standing committee has seen fit to withdraw from an area not only contentious but in my view improper for their consideration _ that is to say the political and ideological views of the prospective nominees,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, a special assistant to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, said that he understood the agreement was based on an `` exchange of letters'' last week following `` personal discussions between <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> leaders and top aides to the attorney general.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to return to pre-1979 language that said `` The committee does not attempt to investigate or report on political or ideological matters with respect to the prospective nominee.'' <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said the only letter he is aware of was one he wrote April 4 to the attorney general summarizing their conversation that day. <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s choice for his deputy, has not been formally nominated by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, charged in an April 17 letter to the president that <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> shared the names of prospective nominees with liberal groups, `` thus enabling those groups to target conservative candidates even before their nominations were made public.'' At Tuesday's hearing, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> resulted `` through the efforts largely of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>.'' His remark appeared calculated to mollify <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> and other conservatives. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said he had discussed the issue and others with <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> but `` I did n't realize I was in any negotiation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> has been accused by liberals and conservatives of considering political views when rating a nominee's qualifications for the judiciary. The rating is delivered during <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearings. Charges from conservatives that the process was being politicized surfaced in 1987 after the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> committee disclosed that four of its 15 members dissented from a recommendation that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> was qualified to sit on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in both political parties have expressed dissatisfaction with the process. Some senators have called for the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> committee to reveal the sources of its information about candidates and how each member voted on a nominee. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is considering a legal claim that the Federal Advisory Commission Act requires the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> panel to meet in public. Such a requirement, the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> says, would inhibit its ability to gather information from professional peers of judicial candidates.

 Americans strongly support increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financing for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping, disaster relief, food production, population control and health programs, according to a public opinion poll released today. The survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> also found that 58 percent of nearly 2,000 randomly chosen adults believed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should abide by all decisions of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which has only advisory powers. Fifteen percent said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> could disregard the court. In 1984, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> rejected the court's authority in a case involving the U.S.-funded Contra war in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. When conflicts break out among countries where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has an interest, 49 percent said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces should be used to try to accommodate all parties. Just 17 percent said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> should use its troops to impose its own solution; 20 percent said `` it depends,'' and 14 percent had no opinion. Sixty percent said all <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> members, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, should pay their full dues to the world body regularly rather than withhold funds to force changes. Fourteen percent said funds could be withheld; 14 percent said `` it depends;'' 12 percent had no opinion. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have withheld more than a $ 500 million from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to force fiscal reforms and because they perceived an anti-Western bias in the organization. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> finally vowed that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will pay all its back dues if present reforms continue. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also made that pledge. When asked how much money the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> member countries should spend on various <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> projects, the respondents favored more funds for social programs except in economic affairs: _ 46 percent wanted more spending to bring peace to regional conflicts; 11 percent favored less money, 31 percent said the right amount is spent now, and 11 percent had no opinion; _ 53 percent wanted more spending to stop disease and improve health care; 8 percent favored less money, 28 percent said the right amount is spent, and 11 percent had no opinion; _ 48 percent wanted to spend more to slow population growth by providing birth control information and devices; 11 percent said `` spend less,'' 30 percent were satisfied now, and 11 percent had no opinion; _ 58 percent want more spent to increase world food production; 7 percent want to spend less, 26 percent were satisfied and 9 percent had no opinion; _ 58 percent wanted to spend for environmental protection, 6 percent wanted to spend less, 26 percent were satisfied and 10 percent had no opinion; _ 53 percent favored more funds for disaster relief; 6 percent said `` spend less,'' 32 percent were satisfied and 9 percent had no opinion; _ 45 percent wanted to spend more to monitor human rights; 12 percent said less should be spent, 31 percent were satisfied However, 36 percent were satisfied with the current level of spending to help manage the world's economy; 31 percent wanted to spend more; 20 percent wanted less spending and 13 percent had no opinion.

Anti-U.S. sentiment is relatively high in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> because of the bloody military suppression of pro-democracy civil uprising there in May 1980. About 200 people were killed and more than 1,000 others injured in the nine-day uprising.

<HEAD>FDA Advisory Panel Urges OK of Drug to Treat AIDS-Related Condition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> advisory committee has recommended approval of a drug used to treat an AIDS-related condition that can lead to blindness. Tuesday's approval of the drug ganciclovir was the second AIDS drug the committee has recommended for approval in two days of hearings. On Monday, the panel recommended approval of the aerosolized version of pentamidine to ward off initial and recurring bouts of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which kills 60 percent of AIDS patients. The committee's decision was based on new data that found ganciclovir is effective in treating cytomegalovirus retinitis in AIDS patients. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval of ganciclovir is expected this summer, and approval of aerosol pentamidine is likely within weeks, said an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Advocates of programs to fight AIDS have been pushing the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to move quickly on approving the drugs. Ganciclovir has been widely available to AIDS patients since November when the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approved use of the drug for treatment of patients who were in the immediate, sight-threatening stage of cytomegalovirus retinitis.

 A familiar-sounding voice boomed out over <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> loudspeakers Tuesday evening announcing the end of the business day. It was President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, personally announcing he was going home. It was the first time in anyone's memory that the president himself had performed the daily chore. `` Ladies and gentlemen of the press, the president having gone home for the day, there is a lid on,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. A `` lid'' is the term used to tell reporters that no more paperwork or presidential actions are expected. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the announcement while walking from the Oval Office to his residence in the White House. Noticing a gathering of reporters hanging around the press office, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked why they were still there. They said they had to wait for him to leave and for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to announce a lid. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked what a lid was, and a reporter explained the term. Usually a lid is announced by a press aide using a telephone that is hooked up to a White House announcement system. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked for the telephone and made the announcement himself at 6:40 p.m. EDT. He departed for his quarters as the press cheered his announcement.

 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` should not be allowed to forget'' the Alaskan oil spill, says consumer activist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> in calling for a consumer boycott of the oil company's products. <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> joined representatives from several environmental and consumer groups in denouncing <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> for its failure to be prepared for and rapidly respond to the oil spill that has fouled hundreds of square miles of pristine water and shoreline along <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s southern coast `` Exxon should not be allowed to forget this oil spill,'' said <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, suggesting <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and the entire petroleum industry must be made aware of public outrage over the spill. `` Americans can take action now by voting with their steering wheel and dollars against all <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> products,'' <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said at a news conference called in connection with a protest against the oil company in several cities across the nation.

<HEAD>ABC Pulls `Crimes of Passion II' for Lack of Advertisers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> says it did n't broadcast a special featuring re-enactments of real-life crimes of passion because there were no advertisers. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> executive said the lack of advertising reflected corporate concerns about public opposition to sex and violence on television. The show, `` Crimes of Passion II,'' had no advertisers as of the day before its scheduled Saturday broadcast, the network said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said `` in the best interests of the network and its affiliates,'' the show was replaced with two 1988 comedy pilots. `` It happened because there is a sensitivity on the part of advertisers to programs of this nature,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Harbert </PERSON>, senior vice president of programming for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's clear, that's obvious and that's growing. Executives at several major advertising agencies said they could not recall any previous network program that had failed to attract advertising and was removed from the schedule. A press release for the special, whose host was actor <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Dern </PERSON>, said it `` explores real-life cases in which people have committed an act of violence aimed against someone they love.'' The program included two stabbings, a shooting and an incident in which a man set fire to his wife. The first `` Crimes of Passion'' was broadcast in October and garnered a 13.2 rating and 23 share in the Wednesday time period now occupied by `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>.'' By comparison, `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>'' had a 12.2 rating and 21 share last week, according to the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 90.4 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. Though `` Crimes of Passion'' did reasonably well in the ratings last fall, it was in a better time period than `` Crimes of Passion II.'' It would have been broadcast on Saturday night, when <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s ratings are much lower `` Livin' Large'' and `` Heart and Soul,'' the replacement shows, were among last week's lowest-rated shows. Had the show run without any paid advertising, it would not be rated by <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>, and that would have hurt the network's affiliated stations during the May sweeps period, when the ratings are used to determine local advertising rates. Earlier this season, advertisers pulled out of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> high-rated special on devil worship and others backed off <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s satirical `` Saturday Night Live.'' A <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> woman's campaign against <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s raunchy `` Married ...

<HEAD>Boycott Of Exxon Products Called Unfair</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By STEPHANIE NANO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The one-day boycott of Exxon products around the country is the start of a `` war of words and actions'' against the nation's largest oil company over its huge Alaskan spill, environmentalists and politicians say The campaign Tuesday met with mixed results in scattered cities and dissents from independent service stations who say they're victims of the spill, too `` I just think the end result is not going to be to hurt the people who are responsible,'' said <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaeger </PERSON>, who manages an Exxon station in <LOCATION> Elmwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` It's going to hurt the little guy trying to make a living.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement calling the boycott unjust, and a company executive defended the cleanup of the spill. `` We can not undo what happened,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` However, we can, and we are, taking every possible action to limit the damage, clean up the mess, and otherwise mitigate the impacts.'' But consumer activist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> `` should not be allowed to forget'' the nation's worst oil spill and that a boycott was the way to send a message to the oil giant. <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> joined representatives from several environmental and consumer groups in accusing Exxon of failing to be prepared for the spill and not rapidly responding to the accident that has fouled hundreds of miles of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s coast. `` Americans can take action now by voting with their steering wheel and dollars against all <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> products,'' <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said 10,000 credit cards out of 7 million have been returned to the company since the March 24th spill. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said it had received no reports from dealers of a loss in volume of gasoline sold as a result of the credit-card return or from boycotts. Only about 5 percent, or 620, of the 12,400 Exxon brand stations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are owned and operated by the company. The rest are independent. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Surette </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gasoline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retailers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Billerica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said his group did a statewide survey of dealers Tuesday but it was too early to assess the impact of the boycott. `` The Exxon dealer had no more to do with that oil spill than the barber who last cut your hair,'' said <PERSON> Surette </PERSON>, saying it was unfair for consumers to vent their anger at dealers. Rallies supporting the boycott were held in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, where about 400 chanting and sign-waving protesters rallied in front of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> headquarters. `` We are beginning the war of words and actions against any oil company that does n't understand its responsibility to protect the environment,'' declared state Sen. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Amick </PERSON>, lead organizer of the boycott movement in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, more than 100 people rallied in the shadow of Alaskan oil tankers being repaired at the shipyard where the ruptured <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> is scheduled to be inspected next month. In <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, three dozen protesters picketed an Exxon gasoline station, chanting such things as `` Cut the card, save the Earth.'' `` We need to show Exxon that massive environmental destruction is more than just bad public relations: It is bad business,'' <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Osten </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. `` We must boycott them until the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> is clean, until innocent victims are compensated and until we are assured that this will never happen again.'' The Alaskan spill and an explosion at a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil rig have heightened concerns over gasoline supplies for the summer's peak driving season. Crude oil prices have risen more than $ 7 a barrel since January. Since the accident, gasoline prices have increased an average 10 percent nationally, while the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> saw surges as high as 25 percent in less than a month, said <PERSON> Marla </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON>, executive assistant to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON>. The rise in prices since the spill prompted calls for a federal investigation from <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> and state attorneys general in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators from <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>.

 A spill of 100,000 gallons of sewage into a flood control channel triggered a precautionary closure of 3 -LCB- miles of beaches as waste trapped behind sandbag dams was pumped back into sewers. Results of water samples from the beaches were due today, said <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Staheli </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do n't know what, if anything, got into the ocean,'' she said.

The 100,000 gallons of sewage spilled when a power outage shut down a pumping station in <LOCATION> Inglewood </LOCATION> on Monday night, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON>, a Sanitation Districts spokesman. Sewage flowed out of manholes for almost an hour until portable generators put the plant back in operation, he said.

<HEAD>Mrs. Thatcher Reaches 10th Anniversary Of Election That Brought Her
To Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ten years ago today an election swept Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to power, and she continues to prevail over a divided opposition despite a recent poll indicating a lot of voters are fed up with her. There was no word today from 10 Downing St. of any special events to mark the anniversary, which television, radio, newspapers and magazines have marked with numerous programs and articles in recent weeks. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, 63, is the century's longest continuously serving British prime minister and the headquarters of her <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has printed a glossy booklet called `` The First 10 Years'' glowing with praise for her. She is now midway through her third term following Conservative victories in the 1983 and 1987 general elections. Despite indications of growing dislike among many voters of her strong-willed personality and right-wing policies, she has said she plans to try for a fourth term. A series of polls released this week indicate most Britons want Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to step down soon and think her right-wing revolution has gone too far. But while they said they do n't like her, the likelihood is they will go on voting for her because they respect the woman who has always led what The Economist weekly calls a `` reluctant nation.'' The Economist noted, for example, that virtually throughout Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s tenure, Gallup soundings have never registered more than 24 percent support for a basic <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> doctrine: tax cuts rather than increased state spending, particularly on welfare. The soundings published Sunday and Tuesday are part of a nationwide assessment of `` Thatcherism'' prompted by the anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s 1979 election triumph over Prime Minister <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Callaghan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> took office the following day, May 4. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s first woman prime minister had been elected by a nation weary of strikes and inflation and yearning for strong government to reverse national decline In the opinion polls, she scored high for qualities such as determination and courage. Her most popular policies, the polls showed, are curbing the trade unions and allowing public housing tenants to buy their homes. Britons see their country as having gained respect abroad, while becoming a more aggressive, violent and selfish society. A leader who set out to wipe out socialism from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> also appears in most soundings to be presiding over a nation that has not taken her message to its heart. A Market and <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> poll published Tuesday in The Independent, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> daily, showed only 30 percent support for the notion that `` private interests and a free market economy should dominate.'' According to a <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> poll in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s liberal Observer newspaper, 58 percent think 10 years of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is enough. And 66 percent agreed with the statement, `` Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has gone too far in her policies.'' But just 7 percent of the 1,040 voters questioned by <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> actually expected Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to resign within the next few years. The soundings also showed a generally subdued reckoning by voters of the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> revolution. For example, just 37 percent of the 1,001 voters questioned by Gallup for the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> said they thought that overall <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is now a better place to live in. And while 67 percent dislike Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> personally, 63 percent respect her. The polls also showed most Britons think the country has become more violent, citing soccer hooliganism and street crime. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who has won big majorities of around 42 percent of the vote while the left-of-center is split, continues to be the party leader most think would be the best prime minister. And when it comes to casting a vote, she ends the first 10 years with 2 to 3 point lead over Labor in most soundings.

<HEAD>Students Across Nation Protest Budget Cuts, Union Recognition, Coca-Cola</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Zip to Zap, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Ah, it's spring again, and college students' fancies are turning to protests even as final exams loom. In at least four states, echoes of the'60s could be heard as students took aim at proposed budget cuts, tuition increases and union recognition. And at a prestigious college, student protests culminated in getting Coca-Cola products banned. Thousands of protesting <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> students skipped classes Tuesday and marched through lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> as a deadline approached on a state spending bill that would reduce money for higher education and force a tuition increase. Hours later, Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> vetoed the bill. At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, teaching and research assistants planned to begin a two-day walkout today and picket campus entrances to protest the school's refusal to recognize their union. <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holyoke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> administrators in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hadley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, under pressure from students to boycott Coca-Cola products because of the company's ties to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, announced a monthlong ban of the company's soft drinks. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, about 4,000 students stepped up protests that began last week. Placard-carrying, chanting students from the university system assembled in front of the World Trade Center, where <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office is located. They blocked traffic for several hours, then paraded past City Hall and to the <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> financial district. `` It's not just a matter of this tuition hike. If we let them go, it will be more,'' said <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, a 29-year-old physics student. `` It will cut out the opportunity for people to rise.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> had given no indication what his decision would be. But one hour before the midnight deadline, he vetoed it, saying university officials had failed to prove the need for the extra money. At <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, neither the 3,200-member Association of Graduate Student Employees nor university officials would predict how many assistants would join today's walkout. `` So far, our indications are that this could be more symbolic than a significant disruption,'' said university spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Debley </PERSON>. The dispute is over the university's view that the assistants' work can not be considered employment because it is so intertwined with educational experience, said <PERSON> Debley </PERSON> Assistants receive annual stipends from the university or research institutions averaging about $ 10,000. The association has been seeking recognition since 1983 as a union so it can negotiate better pay and benefits and improved working conditions. But the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> recently ruled students do not have to be considered employees for the purposes of collective bargaining. The association is appealing the decision. In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, a two-day commemoration was to begin tonight at <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to mark the May 4, 1970, shooting deaths of four students by National Guardsmen during an anti-Vietnam War demonstration. At <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION>, a memo to students today outlined immediate steps to replace <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> products with beverages from companies with little or no business interests in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The decision came Tuesday after 60 protesters shouted anti-Coke slogans outside school President <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennan </PERSON>'s office and chased a <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> delivery truck down the street. Students have pressed administrators for two months to remove <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> products because, they say, the company is reaping profits that benefit white-ruled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` I think it's a monumental step. I think it shows some responsibility on the part of the administration in terms of listening to students,'' said <PERSON> Kuhusu </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanzu </PERSON> of the the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the Quaker group that has tried to organize boycotts at several campuses. A <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> called the students misguided and quoted from a letter by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, an anti-apartheid leader. `` I am sorry to hear that <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> is ... being accused of aiding and abetting the apartheid regime,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said in the April 10 letter, according to <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Preisinger </PERSON>. `` Nothing could be further from the truth.'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> continued: `` It is easy to sound more radical from the safe and comfortable distance of 10,000 miles than those who bear the brunt of the viciousness of the apartheid machinery close at hand.''

Originally, I do n't think anyone thought they could save the eye, but yesterday they said he could see light through it.'' <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> said the attack probably was made by a female owl protecting her young. `` We ca n't verify it, but we assume there was a baby owl on the ground when the youngster went by on the sidewalk,'' he said. `` Whenever young are around, animals become very protective. But I've never heard of great horned owls attacking someone to this extent.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said authorities destroyed both owl parents, not knowing which one attacked and fearing the bird might attack again. He also said officials were forced to destroy the offspring. Great horned owls, named for their large ear tufts, are protected birds but are not considered endangered or threatened.

<TEXT>
 A locomotive missing for more than 100 years in eastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> has been found, but not by the 300 volunteers who searched for it in January with magnetometers and front-end loaders. It turns out the train was recovered months after it was buried by a flood, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Dirgo </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Underwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, a private organization that sponsored the search. `` The train is n't out there,'' said <PERSON> Dirgo </PERSON>. `` It was dug up at the end of August 1878 by a second search party. The initial search party quit. `` We know it was taken to <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and was rebuilt.'' The engine's ultimate fate, however, remains a mystery. Last January, best-selling author <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Cussler </PERSON>, who founded the agency, <PERSON> Dirgo </PERSON> and 300 volunteers used magnetometers and front-end loaders to search a dry river bottom outside of <LOCATION> Bennett </LOCATION>, 30 miles east of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, hoping to find the missing Kansas-Pacific railroad locomotive. But that hunt, and another involving about 25 people the following weekend, failed to turn up any sign of the train. The engine, 19 cars and a caboose fell 30 feet from a bridge the night of May 21, 1878, when a flood struck the area. Twelve cars and the locomotive were reported to have been buried in the sand. The front brakeman, fireman and engineer were killed. The engineer's body was found about 10 miles downriver. <PERSON> Cussler </PERSON>, who wrote the book `` Raise the Titanic'' and lives in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, has located 54 sunken vessels through his organization. His book, `` Night Probe,'' was written with the missing locomotive in mind. But on Monday, <PERSON> Cussler </PERSON> learned that the engine had been raised more than 110 years ago. A friend, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Snoddy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, found the information from documents at a Union Pacific museum. <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> sometime after the flood. The documents <PERSON> Snoddy </PERSON> found indicated the locomotive was removed from the river bed in the middle of the night in August 1878, <PERSON> Dirgo </PERSON> said. It was rebuilt two years later and received a new number in 1885. `` We've been trying to figure out why it was covered up,'' <PERSON> Dirgo </PERSON> said. `` It was removed late at night, and they denied for years that it was uncovered.'' <PERSON> Dirgo </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Cussler </PERSON> originally thought the locomotive's recovery might have been part of an insurance fraud because <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> had been in financial straits at the time of the flood, and the engine was valued at $ 18,000 But that theory did n't seem right, he said. `` I do n't think it was insurance fraud,'' <PERSON> Dirgo </PERSON> said. `` In talking to everybody, they did n't really have insurance back then.'' Many <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> residents, including 79-year-old <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, whose father worked on the cleanup following the flood, had staunchly believed the locomotive remained in a sandy grave. `` How they tricked an entire town for a hundred years,'' <PERSON> Dirgo </PERSON> wondered.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> says <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is in danger of becoming a `` second <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'' and has urged the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> to help end the war between his Soviet-backed government and U.S.-armed Moslem guerrillas. `` It is in the interest of the West to ensure and maintain peace and to establish a broad-based government through a multi-party system, not through attempts to bring to power a small extremist, fanatical group,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said Tuesday. Speaking to foreign reporters during an hourlong news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said Western countries should embrace a `` new spirit of detente'' and do their utmost to help reach a political settlement. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> spoke after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spurned his government's repeated calls for direct talks <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> supplies most of the weapons to Moslem guerrillas fighting to overthrow <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s Marxist regime. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies say they will not deal with a government installed by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> suggested that more fighting could turn <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> into a `` second <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' a reference to the sectarian battles that have wrought havoc in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for 14 years. `` The West must decide who the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is aligning itself with _ a band of cutthroats. Just look at beautiful <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said through a translator. He said the rebels are firing between 2,000 and 3,000 rockets every day into the eastern city 40 miles from the Pakistani border. In <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the guerrillas killed at least 35 soldiers, captured 37, destroyed eight tanks, and captured two others since Sunday in fighting south of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. Pakistani-based guerrillas began attacking the city three weeks after Soviet forces on Feb. 15 ended nine years of involvement in the civil war that began after an April 1978 communist coup. After initial gains by the rebels, the battle for <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> appears to have settled into a stalemate with casualties believed to number in the thousands on both sides. The capture of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> would give the insurgents a badly needed victory to bolster their predictions that <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist rulers would fall soon after Soviet soldiers left <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, a fundamentalist faction leader who serves as foreign minister of the guerrillas' self-proclaimed government, called on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also to stop arming the Afghan communists. His written statement, distributed Tuesday, said an end to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> military aid would `` enable the real representative of the Afghan nation to assume power in order to hold elections of a representative government, which will work to normalize future relations between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' In his remarks, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> claimed that 65,000 rebels had agreed to stop fighting, but he gave no details. Soviet forces entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to help the communist government battle the rebels. More than 100,000 troops were in the country when the Soviets signed a U.N.-sponsored agreement in April 1988 to withdraw.

 Investigators trying to solve the second reported baby abduction from the same family in three years have released a cryptic bit of information about the likely, but so far unknown, suspect. Police Sgt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> came up with a psychological profile of the person responsible. `` We've been led to believe that the perpetrator will suffer severe anxiety as time passes,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said, `` and this will be manifested in behavior the subject will be unable to control. It's my feeling that it will make this person known to police. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, the department's chief of detectives, refused to elaborate on what kind of behavior might be expected or how investigators might spot it. And he refused to say why police released that part of the report. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said police still had hopes for the safe return of 6-week-old <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, whose parents, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, said she was abducted by a masked, armed intruder at their home Saturday night. He said investigators have found no evidence disproving the parents' story, that for the second time in three years a masked gunman abducted their baby daughter. `` There's nothing to indicate that the <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> are anything but victims at this time,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said. Their 13-day-old daughter, <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON>, disappeared under almost identical circumstances in 1986. <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON>'s body was found five days later, about 150 feet from the couple's home in <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>. No cause of death was determined and no arrest was made in the case, although investigators at the time said the parents were suspects. Dr. <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a pediatrician who examined <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> on April 22, said the baby had been in good health and there was nothing unusual in the way Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> had handled her.

 Officials in the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family's hometown have a `` day of mourning'' for Thursday's first anniversary of the death of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' mother, whose body still lies in an open casket The Marcoses refuse to bury <PERSON> Josefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>, who died May 4, 1988, until President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> allows her deposed predecessor to return from Hawaiian exile for the funeral. There's no indication the 95-year-old woman's body will be buried anytime soon. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Nalupta </PERSON>, mayor of this town of about 40,000 people that is 250 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, said today that the municipal council declared the day of mourning because `` everybody is still grieving.'' But he said no special ceremonies were scheduled apart from Roman Catholic Masses, which have been said nearly every day since Mrs. <PERSON> Edralin-Marcos </PERSON>' body was brought last year from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, where she died. Her body has been lying in an open casket in the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> ancestral home, which has been turned into a museum. The wake has attracted an unusual assortment of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters, tourists, curiosity-seekers and a cult of religious fanatics, who believe <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is `` the second son of God.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has cited national security in refusing to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where he has lived since he was ousted in a popular uprising three years ago. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been hospitalized since January with heart and bronchial ailments, and his followers say he is dying. <LOCATION> Nalupta </LOCATION> and many others here in <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' home province of <ORGANIZATION> Ilocos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION> believe the former president should be allowed to return, both to bury his mother and die in his homeland. `` We have given up all hopes that the Aquino government would allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to come home,'' said Congressman <PERSON> Mariano </PERSON> <PERSON> Nalupta </PERSON>, a brother of the mayor. `` We have given it to the will of God.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Malabed </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family's mortician, said it has cost the former president's family about $ 950 a month to continue the wake, including charges for flowers, embalming supplies and changes in clothing. <PERSON> Malabed </PERSON> said he inspects the body periodically and adds more embalming fluid every two months. He said the lengthy, highly publicized wake has been great for his business.

<HEAD>Scientist Use Poems, Visuals to Illustrate Cold Fusion Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX DOMINGUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Physicists are resorting to poems and visual aids like a blade of grass to help illustrate the problems they found in two chemists' claim of achieving nuclear fusion in a jar. `` Tens of millions of dollars are at stake, dear sister and brother, because one scientist put a thermometer in one place instead of the other,'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyerhof </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> recited to reporters Tuesday at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Meyerhof said the excess heat that the researchers attribute to cold fusion was caused instead by incorrect temperature measurements. He said the device the researchers used failed to distribute temperature evenly. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> chemist <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and his collaborator, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION>, startled the world March 23 by announcing they had achieved fusion at room temperature. Most efforts to achieve fusion, the nuclear reaction that powers the sun, have required staggeringly high temperatures. Cold fusion could open the door to a clean, cheap and virtually unlimited source of energy. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> said they did it by placing palladium and platinum electrodes in a flask of deuterium oxide, or heavy water, and applying electric current. Deuterium is a heavier isotope, or cousin, of ordinary hydrogen. The researchers claimed the nuclei of the deuterium atoms fused, releasing neutrons and producing four times more heat than invested. But in an informal show of hands, the scientists on a panel at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> meeting Tuesday voted 8-1 that they were 95 percent confident the excess heat was not produced by nuclear fusion. However, the panel also voted 6-3 against ruling out that experiments in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and elsewhere had produced neutrons. `` The bottom line is we see nothing anomalous in any of their experiments and have identified what we believe are serious errors in the experiment,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Koonin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Koonin </PERSON> was part of a three-member <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> team that tried to duplicate the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiments. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Skiff </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> physicist, said that after attempting to duplicate the results for two weeks he was certain cold fusion had not taken place. `` It appears the work by <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> is very sloppy,'' Skiff said. `` They should have presented their research in the scientific community before going public with it,'' he said. `` The public debate on this matter makes science look bad because of the complicated process of verification.'' One of the few physicists to hold out hope for cold fusion, <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, said his experiments had produced neutrons but at a level much lower than the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> experiment claimed. Cold fusion needs further study, but is only a little understood effect, he said. He used a blade of grass to illustrate his point. `` I do n't think it will grow into a tree,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` I think it will grow into a pleasant little flower in the garden of physics.'' <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleishmann </PERSON> have not responded in detail to this week's criticism in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> But <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> did say: `` The absence of neutrons does not concern us in the slightest. We could n't be happier. We and other scientists will soon tell them why this is so.'' <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> officials also defended the research. `` It's difficult for me to believe people of <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>' and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>'s caliber could forget to put a thermometer in the right place or something basic like stirring,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brophy </PERSON>, the university's vice president for research. `` It does n't shake my confidence. It's never nice to be criticized. However, when you're out in front, the wind can be cool sometimes.

 Thunderstorms moved across northern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> today, dumping heavy rain and hail, while Midwesterners awoke to another chilly morning. The most severe thunderstorms were near <LOCATION> Ranger </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where funnel clouds were spotted Tuesday night. The town is about 70 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. Baseball-sized hail fell near the town, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Heavy wind blew over two semi-trailer trucks on Interstate 20 near Ranger, authorities said. Also in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, thunderstorm winds destroyed a barn in northern <LOCATION> Parker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, tore off a roof of a country club and overturned several mobile homes in <LOCATION> Comanche </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Winds were recorded up to 80 mph. Thunderstorms also were over southern <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and central <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. Rain showers developed from <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> to central <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, and showers fell over the lower Great Lakes region. <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, had more than an inch of rain in the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT, while Limestone, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> each recorded nearly two-thirds of an inch in the same period.

<HEAD>Delta Found Not At Fault in Flight 191 Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the first verdict dealing with the carrier's liability, a jury cleared <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> in the 1985 crash of Flight 191 that killed 137 people at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. A federal jury decided Tuesday that the carrier was n't responsible for the crash because the plane's crew was unaware of deadly wind shear before landing `` This confirms our belief that neither <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> nor its pilots caused the accident and shows that the pilots were not aware of the dangerous storm they were flying into,'' the Atlanta-based airline said in a statement. Other juries around the nation have ordered damage awards to Flight 191's survivors and families of some of the 137 people who died in the crash, but only the value of lives, not the question of liability, was at issue. The suit that led to Tuesday's judgment was brought by the family of <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, who was killed when the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> L-1011 jet, en route from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale-Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, crashed during a violent thunderstorm on Aug. 2, 1985. For <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, the verdict strengthened its hopes in other cases pending nationwide that are trying to establish that the company was at fault. Tuesday's verdict also could affect a lawsuit brought by <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> against the federal government. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> has claimed in its suit that meteorologists and air-traffic controllers failed to inform the crew of the worsening weather and wants the government to pay all or part of the claims facing the airline. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has blamed the crash on a microburst, a violent downward blast of air often associated with severe thunderstorms. The non-jury trial in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> ended last week. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Belew </PERSON> has said he may not rule for months on who was to blame for the crash. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and its insurance companies already have paid more than $ 66 million in death, injury and damage claims from the Flight 191 crash, and the total is expected to exceed $ 100 million. In those cases, survivors who brought lawsuits against <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and its insurance companies have waived the question of liability. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>'s family wanted <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> to admit responsibility for the crash and to pay damages to the family for lost wages he would have provided had he lived. The jury's verdict resulted in no damages being awarded. The family's attorney, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, argued during the trial that the plane's pilot `` willfully and intentionally'' flew into the thunderstorm that caused the crash. But <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Barwick </PERSON> said key evidence in the trial came from a private pilot who landed at the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> airport seconds before the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> jet crashed. `` He said he was trapped and he had no indication of the conditions he was flying into,'' <PERSON> Barwick </PERSON> said. `` The flight crews were completely taken by surprise. I think the jury agreed with us, that <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and its crew were victims just like Mr. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>Emigration Highest Since 1979, But Less Bound for Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Jewish emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in April soared to its highest level in 10 years, according to figures released today by an agency that helps to resettle the emigrants. However, the share of those bound for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> fell to a new low. <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucault </PERSON>, spokeswoman of the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> Intergovernmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Migration </ORGANIZATION>, said 4,129 Jews arrived at the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> transit center from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in April, compared with 3,893 in March. Only 87 of them, or 2.1 percent, said they wanted to go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Most were heading for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said Ms. <PERSON> Boucault </PERSON>. Last year the share of Soviet Jews bound for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was still 7.1 percent. In 1987, before the Palestinian uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> strip it was as high as 24.4 percent. Since the beginning of 1989, 12,864 Jews have left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, according to ICM figures. On Tuesday, the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Soviet Jewry reported an emigration total of 4,557 Jews for April. The ICM figures only account for those Soviet Jews who pass through <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. The program for Jewish emigration from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> began in 1971 and reached a peak in 1979 when 51,328 were allowed to leave the country. This dropped sharply when <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> chilled East-West relations.

 Disagreement over a multibillion-dollar plan to clean up the country's environment has brought down the 7-year-old center-right government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON>. The Christian Democrat on Tuesday announced the resignation of his Cabinet after a right-wing junior partner objected to his proposal to end $ 325 million in income tax deductions for people who drive their cars to work. Political observers predicted <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> would form a coalition with the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, second only to the Christian Democrats in the number of parliamentary seats it holds. <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON>' action headed off a possible motion of no confidence threatened by the junior coalition partner, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>. `` Environmental policy certainly needs to be paid for, but why just by those who live at some distance from their jobs?'' said <PERSON> Joris </PERSON> <PERSON> Voorhoeve </PERSON>, the right-wing party's leader in the 150-seat Parliament. <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON>' announcement came at the end of a tense 7 -LCB- - hour parliamentary debate on a $ 3.65 billion government plan to cut pollution of the country's atmosphere to 30 percent of current levels by the year 2010 `` If only we could motivate one in ten -LRB- car-driving commuters -RRB- to change their habits ... that would have a very large effect on the congestion, on mobility, on the environment,'' <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> said. The crisis also reflected years of irritation among Voorhoeve's party at steadily losing decision-making power to the charismatic <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON>, who enjoys immense popularity in this nation of 14.6 million people The 49-year-old prime minister said he planned to meet with Queen <PERSON> Beatrix </PERSON> today `` to offer the resignation of all the ministers'' in the Cabinet. In Dutch constitutional practice, the government will continue in office with caretaker status until early elections later this year. After the elections, it can take several months until a new government is formed. Parliamentary elections had been scheduled for May 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have been in virtually every postwar Dutch government and are likely to be the centerpiece of the next one. Never in postwar Dutch history has a political party garnered sufficient votes to govern alone. The 8-year-old <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> government has aimed to cut the $ 13 billion budget deficit and 11 percent unemployment rate. In recent months, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has accused <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON>' party of backing off from a pledge to cut corporate and private taxes and slash social security, education and health care outlays. But the issue that prompted the government's resignation was a <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> proposal to end the tax break for car-driving commuters in a bid to reduce car exhaust fumes and highway congestion by forcing motorists to take mass transit. Voorhoeve also objected to a proposed $ 270 million increase in the tax on diesel fuel that would mainly hit the trucking industry, one of the mainstays of the Dutch economy. Under the anti-pollution plan, farmers also would have to pay toward cleaning up deposits of manure produced by their livestock, deposits that contribute to acid rain. The plan would set levies for polluting industries and contain proposals for cleaning up hundreds of toxic waste dumps. Voorhoeve's move to topple the government had the support of the 52-seat <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> opposition, and the 54 <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> would not have been able to hold off a no-confidence vote. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has 27 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, while 12 seats are held by three opposition parties and five seats by three right-wing parties that are generally supportive of the government.

<TEXT>
 If the Vietnamese troop pullout from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is independently confirmed and the constitution rewritten to his satisfaction, Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> says he will return home as head of state. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, leader of the guerrilla coalition resisting the Vietnamese-backed government, said today that he expects to decide before November if his conditions have been met. He made the comments at a news conference on the second day of peace talks in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>. An international commission, to be named at a conference in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on July 24-25, must first make sure the Vietnamese withdrawal is genuine, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has promised to pull out its remaining troops by Sept. 30. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s other demands include a four-party interim government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> until elections can be held, and constitutional guarantees for a multiparty political system. The proposed interim administration would include the present Cambodian government of Premier <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s non-communist followers, anti-communists from former Premier Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> has been trying to persuade <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> to abandon the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and return home as head of the the government he headed until being ousted in 1970. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which came to power in 1975 and was forced out by the invading Vietnamese in 1978, is not represented at the talks. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said no support could be expected from them following the <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> talks. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> will reject everything because they are interested in the continuation of the war,'' he said. The fanatical <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is accused of killing hundreds of thousands of people during its bloody reign. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and their allies insist that <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> and other leaders of the original `` genocidal clique'' be barred from any future government. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> guerrilla group, today rejected any conciliatory moves by the Vietnamese-installed government, saying they should be thrown `` into the dustbin.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> radio was commenting on the constitutional amendments the pro-Vietnamese government adopted Sunday. In concessions to <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> had changed the country's name from <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kampuchea </ORGANIZATION> to the State of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, as well as changed its flag and anthem and promised several changes to the constitution These are merely part of efforts to legitimize the regime, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> broadcast said. A text of Tuesday's broadcast was obtained today in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. The radio complained that the government had changed its outer shell but `` the true nature remains a Vietnamese puppet, socialist regime.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said Tuesday that close ties with a future Cambodian government would not be possible if it were heavily influenced by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said the Sino-Soviet summit in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in mid-May should be beneficial to his cause. He said Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` may put some moral pressure on Hun Sen'' and the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership might apply pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> to seek a settlement in the 10-year-old conflict. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is the primary military backer of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> traveled today to the depressed <LOCATION> Copperbelt </LOCATION> mining region of central <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s poorest and most indebted nations. The pope conducted a two-hour, open-air Mass at an abandoned airport at <LOCATION> Kitwe </LOCATION>, the second-largest city in this southern African nation of 7.5 million people, three-fourths of whom are <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>. In the near distance, behind the Papal podium, smoke stacks at a copper smelting plant billowed black smoke into clear tropical skies. Church choirs sang hymns to the throb of African tribal drums as the pontiff, in an open `` popemobile'' rode through a crowd of 100,000 pilgrims. A hymn, written for the Mass in the local <PERSON> Bemba </PERSON> dialect, described the pope as `` our hero.'' With arms outstretched, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> blessed groups of women chanting and ululating, a traditional means of expressing joy. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, his face reddened by the tropical sun, paid tribute to white priests who set up the first Roman Catholic missions in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> nearly 100 years ago. Today, there are 1.7 million Catholics in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. Tens of thousands of pilgrims, mainly from northern districts of this nation, waved yellow-and-white <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> flags and wore sari-like cloths emblazoned with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s portrait. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Copperbelt </LOCATION> diocese of <LOCATION> Ndola </LOCATION> that covers <LOCATION> Kitwe </LOCATION> said in a brief welcoming statement that the pope is visiting the mining region at a time of economic hardships. The fall in world copper prices left <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> with `` an enormous national debt,'' severe unemployment and social problems, he said. Copper prices slumped in the 1970s. Current foreign debt of $ 5 billion drains about two-fifths of all export income, 90 percent of which is derived from sales of copper. On his arrival in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> lashed out at white-ruled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of apartheid or racial separation, describing it as an unacceptable system. Zambian President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, in his welcoming speech, also assailed apartheid and said the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s visit would strengthen <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>'s resolve to work for peace in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` in a spirit of dialogue and reconciliation and not confrontation.'' <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, 65, is chairman of the African Frontline States, a grouping of six black countries spearheading efforts to end apartheid. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the main guerrilla-backed movement fighting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s government, have said they would like to meet the pope while he is in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s external headquarters. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials said no talks were planned, but they did not rule out the prospect of an informal meeting. The pope is on the third leg of a four-nation tour of African and <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> states. He leaves <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> on Thursday for neighboring <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Colleagues of slain anti-apartheid activist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> today offered a reward for the arrest of his killers and advised police officials to look within their own ranks for suspects. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, a university lecturer and outspoken critic of the government's policy of detention without trial, was shot outside his home Monday by an assailant in a passing car who fired a shotgun from close range. Also today, six mortar bombs were fired at an army radar installation near the border with <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, damaging living quarters but causing no injuries. Regarding <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, police have released sketches of three unidentified white men suspected of involvement in the killing and have offered a $ 4,000 reward for information leading to arrests. Today, the University of the Witwatersand, where <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> taught anthropology, offered an additional $ 4,000 reward. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Charleton </PERSON>, the chief administrator of the multiracial university, said it was `` deeply disquieting'' that police had made no arrests in connection with a series of previous attacks and vandalism aimed at staff and students. Anti-apartheid activists who worked with <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> announced at a news conference that his funeral would held Saturday. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, a prominent human rights advocate, called for an investigation into the possible existence of death squads formed to kill government opponents. `` There may be no more profitable place to start such an investigation than within the ranks of the police themselves,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. `` This is the body which has the expertise, the information and the wherewithal to carry out such acts so professionally.'' <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>, a leader of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> anti-apartheid coalition, told the news conference that <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> `` was a very carefully chosen target.'' `` His cold-blooded murder is meant to serve as a warning to the increasing numbers of whites who are daring to associate themselves in word and deed with the oppressed people of this country,'' <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON> said. `` We fear that more and more of our leaders are going to be assassinated.'' `` The ordinary people of this country have a strong suspicion that <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s assassin is a member of the police force,'' he added. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> was an authority on the tactics used legally and illegally to repress or intimidate government opponents. He recently completed an article discussing unsolved abductions and assassinations of anti-apartheid activists. Numerous black activists have been slain in recent years. Many white activists have received anonymous threats or have been harassed but few have been attacked since the unsolved 1978 killing of <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION>. In north-central <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, security forces set off a land mine while trying to catch those who fired the mortar bombs at the radar installation, but the detonation of the mine caused no injuries, the military said. It said the radar installation was near <LOCATION> Mafikeng </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> border. There was no immediate indication who was responsible. There have been few attacks on army bases, and very few mortar bombardments during the 28-year-old guerrilla campaign waged by the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. South African officials have contended that <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas often infiltrate from <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> to carry out bombing and sabotage missions.

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s representative to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> remained in a coma today but was reported in stable condition a day after being shot in the head by a masked gunman Another guerrilla from <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainline <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction was killed today as he drove his motorcycle down a main street in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hourani </PERSON>, 30, `` died instantly from several shot wounds in the head and chest,'' said a police spokesman. The gunman escaped. A spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Hammoud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s representative, 48-year-old <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON>, survived a five-hour operation to remove a bullet that pierced the left side of his forehead in an assassination attempt Tuesday. `` The operation was a success. Mr. <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> is in stable condition but still in coma. However, we wo n't know if we can take him off the critical list for at least 48 hours,'' the spokesman said. He declined to be named. <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> was the second high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official to become the target of an assassination attempt in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> within four days. Police said a lone assailant, wearing a plastic mask and armed with a 9mm pistol, fired two bullets into <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>'s head and shoulder at a gift store in this port city's <LOCATION> Fakhreddin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>. The gunman escaped through narrow alleyways leading to the Palestinian refugee camp of <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Hilweh </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s southern flank, according to police. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Nasserite </ORGANIZATION> leftist Moslem militia that governs <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> said they launched a joint hunt for the gunman. But spokesmen for both groups said no arrests were made. There was no claim of responsibility for the attempt against <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> or the rocket-propelled grenade attack Saturday on the house of <PERSON> Zeid </PERSON> <PERSON> Wehbi </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, on an official visit in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, called the attack on <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> `` a message for us to put up our hands and stop helping our <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> brothers.'' That was interpreted by Christian-controlled radio stations in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as an accusation against <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, whose forces have been locked in heavy artillery duels with Christian units of the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> army in the past seven weeks. <PERSON> Wehbi </PERSON>, however, blamed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s secret service. He told reporters the attack was designed to `` deal a blow to <LOCATION> Lebanese-Palestinian </LOCATION> coexistence in the <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> region.'' Wehbi charged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is launching `` a wave of assassination attempts against our brethren.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, a staunch foe of Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, had declared support for the Christians in the latest round of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war that has claimed almost 300 lives. But <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s estimated 5,000 guerrillas who have returned to the <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> region after his evacuation from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> during <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 invasion have taken no active part in the fighting. <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s third largest city 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, is the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s main power base in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

Ms. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> alleged that <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> struck her when she went to his farm to recover property that belonged to her, according to a court complaint. `` While she -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> -RRB- was there, defendant <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> became angry, hit her in the face with a Bible, knocked her down, kicked her in the face,'' the complaint said. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>, an executive at Music Row's <ORGANIZATION> Buddy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attractions </ORGANIZATION>, which handles bookings for <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, said the singer told him that Ms. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> started destroying property at his house. `` He asked her to leave several times and she refused to leave,'' <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> called the police, the police came to the house, took statements from both parties, and I guess she filed charges against him. `` He did state that he's totally shocked and that he's never been arrested for anything in his life.'' <LOCATION> Sumner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Chief Deputy J.D. <PERSON> Vandercook </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> called officers to his home. `` Any citizen of <LOCATION> Sumner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> or of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has the right to obtain a warrant,'' <PERSON> Vandercook </PERSON> said. `` Her testimony will have to be weighed against his in General Sessions Court.'' Reached at her home, Ms. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> said she has known <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> `` a pretty good while. ... He's a wonderful musician and a wonderful songwriter, but he's got a mean streak down his back.'' No one answered a telephone call to <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>'s office this morning. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> won a Grammy award this year for `` Southern Flavor,'' under the first-time bluegrass music category. He is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame and has played at the Opry for 50 years.

 About 200 young people attacked stores and restaurants following May Day celebrations in the Central <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> republic of <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION>, and police arrested 100 of them to end the rampage, Pravda said today. `` Those who were detained said they acted because of exorbitant prices of cooperatives and the low quality of products and services,'' Pravda said. `` But as a method of protest, as was seen, they chose hooliganism.'' About 200 young people gathered in <LOCATION> Ashkabad </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION>, on Monday evening after May Day celebrations and began attacking stores, parks and restaurants. They broke glass and damaged some cars, Pravda said. <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION> is a southern Soviet republic bordering the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The crowd was led by criminals, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper charged. Police resorted to force after the youths ignored an order to disperse. `` Not less than 100 lawbreakers were detained, and no one was hurt,'' Pravda said. It quoted Interior Minister <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION> as saying that police had heard rumors there would be trouble but that they managed to break it up without using tear gas or truncheons. The paper's specific reference to tear gas and truncheons apparently was intended to assure readers that there was no repeat of the violent clash between demonstrators and soldiers in the Georgian republic on April 9. Soldiers there waded into a crowd of pro-independence demonstrators with clubs and shovels, and used gas to disperse them. Nineteen people were killed and one more young man was shot to death later for violating curfew. There have been no reports of any previous such trouble in <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION>, a republic of 3.5 million people, the most sparsely populated of the five traditionally Moslem Central Asian republics. There have been reports of religious and civil unrest in neighboring <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. Pravda said <LOCATION> Ashkabad </LOCATION> has remained quite since the unrest was quelled. Cooperatives are the small, privately-owned businesses permitted under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reforms to provide goods and services the state-run economy can not. Although the cooperatives are still only a fraction of the official economy, many Soviets view them with suspicion, believing their operators are interested only in a quick profit and that they take materials out of the state-run economy. Soviet consumers are being squeezed by shortages of consumer goods and food items and by inflation.

 A Palestinian shouting `` God is great'' stabbed to death two elderly Israelis waiting at a bus stop in downtown <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> today, police said. Three other Israelis were seriously injured in the attack. Dozens of angry passers-by chased the short, stocky assailant about 30 yards and caught him after a brief struggle. Police pinned the Arab to the ground in a nearby flower shop to protect him from the crowd. Police said the man, a 25-year-old resident of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, acted alone. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the attacker was a former member of a Moslem fundamentalist group, and police said he had been questioned about unspecified `` terrorist activities'' in the past. The attack came one day after <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> disavowed the 25-year-old <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> charter, which calls for the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. His announcement in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> prompted protests from radical Palestinian factions. The stabbings further escalated Arab-Jewish tensions in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, already at a breaking point after 17 months of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> rebellion against Israeli rule in the occupied lands. Nearly 460 Palestinians and 20 Israelis have been killed since the uprising began in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The stabbings occurred around 11 a.m. across from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s main post office on <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, the main shopping street in Jewish west <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Police reinforcements, including mounted horse patrols, rushed to the scene to control groups of angry Israelis who shouted `` Death to the terrorists!'' and `` Death to the Arabs!'' About three hours after the stabbing, police fired tear gas to disperse dozens of followers of Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>'s anti-Arab <ORGANIZATION> Kach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> who shouted `` revenge, revenge.'' The group was en route to the Western Wall, <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>'s holiest site, to stage a protest when it was halted by police. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, who is from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was arrested along with six of his followers. They were charged with disturbing public order. Police Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> urged restraint. `` I hope it wo n't prompt extremists from our side to react because that could bring about a vicious cycle,'' <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio <PERSON> Romi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON>, who was sitting in a <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> restaurant, said the assailant was shouting `` God is Great'' when he attacked five Israelis at the bus stop, four of them elderly. `` He was going crazy and started stabbing people. We caught him at the end of the street,'' <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sima </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozer </PERSON>, an employee in the <ORGANIZATION> Newman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> across from the post office on <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, said the short, stocky <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was carrying a blood-covered eight-inch knife as he was being chased. `` Then a policeman came and stopped the crowd from lynching him,'' she said. `` Police threw him on the floor of the flower shop ... while people outside were shouting ` kill him, kill him, death to the Arabs.''' At one point during the chase, she said she heard a gun shot. A reporter saw blood on the floor of the flower shop. Minutes later, the crowd chased a Palestinian teen-ager wearing a white kaffiyeh headdress. Two policemen whisked him away to safety. <PERSON> Vardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalman </PERSON>, 60, was taken to a nearby souvenir shop where he later died of his wounds. Hundreds of onlookers crowded the shop entrance, and the body, wrapped in a white sheet, was carried to an ambulance. <PERSON> Nissim </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, 91, died of wounds at <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> which was also treating a woman in her 90s. <ORGANIZATION> Bikur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> reported treating two men, one 64 and the other a 25-year-old Jewish seminary student, for stab wounds in the stomach and chest. Police Commissioner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Krauss </PERSON> said the assailant appeared to have no accomplices. Police spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said the assailant had spent the night praying at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> mosque to mark <PERSON> Leilat </PERSON> al Kadr, the night the Moslem holy book Koran was received by the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. He said the man had a record of being detained and questioned about anti-Israeli acts in the past. Police did not say if the attacker operated under orders from a group or initiated the attack on his own. The army sealed the assailant's hometown, <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, setting up roadblocks on main roads, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. Troops detained dozens of Palestinian youths after ordering them off buses and taxis, they said. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s announcement in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Tuesday prompted immediate protests from radical Palestinians, including the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>. Slogans painted on walls in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said, `` Down with the betrayer <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>.'' Last year, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opened talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist.

 A man has been charged with beating to death a 3 -LCB- - year-old boy who police say lived `` a life of torture'' from almost daily physical abuse A relative and two neighbors witnessed some of the abuse but none contacted authorities, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions Neighbors and police said <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, 38, beat the boy, <PERSON> Hanif </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, with his fists, a belt or sneakers and forced the child to stand in the bathroom for long periods in uncomfortable positions. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> was being held without bail in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> Jail today on charges of first-degree murder, five counts of assault and battery and one count of deriving support from a prostitute. Police said the abuse culminated in a beating Saturday. On Monday, <PERSON> Hanif </PERSON> died at <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> of trauma to the head. When he was admitted to the hospital on Saturday, he was suffering swelling and bleeding of the brain, a ruptured spleen and bruises, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McEvoy </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Middlesex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> assistant district attorney. `` The baby was leading a life of torture,'' said Police Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> is a heroin addict whose habit was supported by the boy's mother, <PERSON> Rosalyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochester </PERSON>, through prostitution. `` She kept nothing for herself and nothing for the baby,'' <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON> said. A social worker from the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> regularly visited the apartment where the boy lived. A spokeswoman, <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Carli </PERSON>, said the agency was concerned about neglect but was unaware of any abuse of the boy. `` This is very frightening to us. It is an unexpected, unpredictable explosion of violence,'' she said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, a neighbor living downstairs from Ms. <PERSON> Rochester </PERSON> and her son, told the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>, `` It goes back for months. He beat the kid every day. I could hear the kid screaming and fighting. `` My old lady said tey were just wrestling, but when you wrestle with a kid there is laughing and giggling. I never heard laughing. I feel bad I never called someone ... but -LRB- <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> -RRB- was into dope and I did n't want to get into trouble,'' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said. Another neighbor, <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Hanif </PERSON> was often beaten for urinating in his pants, and an unnamed relative of <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s said she saw burns on <PERSON> Hanif </PERSON>'s back, the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> reported. The Social Services' case was opened after an anonymous report of medical neglect Jan. 26, three days after <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> was released from the <ORGANIZATION> Billerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> where he had been held for assault and robbery, the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Space shuttle technicians closed up the engine compartment today as the countdown advanced smoothly toward Thursday's scheduled launch of Atlantis with five astronauts. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said the launch team completed certification of two replacement parts in the fuel system and other components and reinstalled access panels on the engine compartment. Also under way today was a check of the shuttle communications system. `` We're humming right along,'' she said. `` This time we're going to see if we can get it right,'' astronaut <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who will command the flight, said Tuesday. Four days earlier, a launch attempt was called off just 31 seconds before the planned liftoff. `` Looks like the vehicle's been turned around real well,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> told reporters. `` We're extremely pleased the folks here at the cape were able to do such a good and quick job getting it ready to go again.'' The other crew members are pilot <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabe </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleave </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Thagard </PERSON>. Liftoff is scheduled for 1:48 p.m. Thursday. `` There are no major issues in sight,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy director of operations, said after a mission management meeting Tuesday `` We're pressing on.'' Shuttle weather forecasters said there was a 70 percent chance conditions would be favorable. The only concern was a threat of crosswinds greater than 17 mph that could be dangerous if the shuttle had to make an emergency landing on a runway near the launch pad. Atlantis will carry into space the $ 550 million <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> probe, which the astronauts are to dispatch on a 15-month journey to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. The probe is to orbit the planet and map its cloud-shrouded surface with a high resolution radar system. The launch attempt was halted on Friday because of a short circuit in a fuel pump. Technicians working around the clock replaced the pump and a suspect fuel line in half the time expected. Engineers thought there was a leak in the fuel line, but tests turned up nothing. They believe a vapor cloud seen spewing from the line, thought to be gas, might have been trapped air. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON>, a shuttle test director, said the new countdown, which started Tuesday, was compressed from three days to two by eliminating some `` hold time'' that is built into the countdown in case of problems and by not repeating some tasks completed in the first attempt.

 Sixty-three years after his death, legendary escape artist <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON> pulled off another one. He eluded efforts by magic lovers to contact him through a seance conducted by <PERSON> Kreskin </PERSON>, an entertainer who says he has special powers of mental telepathy. Locks jiggled and hands of seance sitters quivered Tuesday, but neither <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON> nor his wife, <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>, spoke to the 25 people at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magic </ORGANIZATION> hoping to hear from them. Despite about 30 minutes of hand-holding, nobody reported hearing anything from either <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON>. `` Scientifically, we really have no evidence that we communicated with the spirit world,'' said <PERSON> Kreskin </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Kreskin </PERSON> said he will try to remedy that in the future by offering $ 1 million to anyone who can pass a test designed to provide evidence of psychic phenomena. Museum owner <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lund </PERSON>, who organized the seance, said he had hoped to get through to <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON> by first reaching <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON>'s wife, whom <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON> had promised to contact from the grave. <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON> died Oct. 31, 1926, in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> after his appendix ruptured. His wife died in 1943. Nine people, including a retired judge and an assistant fire chief, sat expectantly amid <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON> mementos _ photos of <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON> and his wife, a will written by Mrs. <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON> on the train back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with her husband's body and a large metal milk can from which <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON> escaped during his act. A large poster of <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON>, dating to 1911, hung above their heads. They closed their eyes, held hands and turned their palms up as <PERSON> Kreskin </PERSON> slowly counted to 20 and urged them to think about Mrs. <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON>. `` We're waiting for some sign, but that sign can be within us as well as outside of us,'' he said, adding the signs could be shaking hands or feeling a breeze. One woman said her left hand went numb, another woman felt cool and a third said she felt hot. One man's hand shook, and a padlock on <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON>'s metal can jiggled. <PERSON> Kreskin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lund </PERSON> had promised no trickery, but skeptics in the audience contended the padlock jiggled only because the wooden platform on which it was placed was unstable. Such physical reactions are unprovable and could be the result of suggestion, <PERSON> Kreskin </PERSON> said. `` Darn it ... there is no way on the face of the earth of proving spiritualistic phenomena,'' he said. Still, <PERSON> Lund </PERSON> expressed no disappointment. `` It was successful in terms of getting a lot of press attention and people here. Whether it was successful in contacting Mrs. <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON>, I do n't know that we contacted Mrs. <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Lund </PERSON> said. One thing he is sure of: <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON> would have liked it. `` I think he would have turned to -LRB- showman -RRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohan </PERSON> and said, ` Say, I really pulled it off, <PERSON> George </PERSON>. Do you think you could do as well?''' <PERSON> Lund </PERSON> said.

 American education is stagnating by nearly every measure in a new comparison of school performance across the country, Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said today in releasing the discouraging report card. The sixth annual State Education Performance Chart shows a decline in the national high school graduation rate and falling scores on college entrance exams in half the states. `` We must do better. We must revitalize education in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' by setting targets for improvement, <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said in a statement accompanying the report. `` We have not made any progress in the last three years,'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> elaborated in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' program. `` It's hard to say why. I still believe that we have not focused on the fundamental issues of trying to get everybody involved in the education of children. It's not a matter of dollars.'' `` I'm going to write to every governor, to every school board president, I'm going to communicate with the leaders, the superintendents and all the people out there and say we must issue a challenge'' to improve the schools, <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said. Performance targets include boosting high school graduation rates to 90 percent and cutting in half the number of children who fail a grade. `` Today about 3,600 students will drop out of school ... I think it's a disaster that we must turn around,'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said. The performance chart, known as the `` wall chart,'' shows a general lack of progress despite the continuing spate of reform efforts and ever-rising education spending _ up to $ 3,977 per student on this year's chart compared to $ 3,756 last year. National scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test -LRB- SAT -RRB- fell from 906 to 904 -LRB- on a scale of 400 to 1,600 -RRB- from 1987 to 1988. Fully 14 of the 22 states in which the SAT is the dominant college entrance exam registered declines. Scores on the American College Testing Program -LRB- ACT -RRB-, on a scale of 1 to 36, showed a scant .1 - point And 11 of the 28 states in which the ACT dominates posted decreases. Looking at trends since the first wall chart was issued in 1982, one bright note was a continuous rise in the percentage of students taking the Advanced Placement test qualifying them for college credit, from 5 to 11 percent. The department attributed the climb largely to doubled Hispanic involvement and an 83 percent increase in participation by blacks. The high school graduation rate rose from 69.5 percent in the first chart to 71.7 percent in 1985. But it fell slightly in 1986 to 71.6 percent and dropped to 71.1 percent in 1987, the latest year for which statistics could be calculated. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> ranked first with a high school completion rate of 90.6 percent, while the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> was last at 55.5 percent. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> showed the most improvement, zooming from 25th in 1982 to second in 1987; <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> did the worst, falling from 28th to 48th. The Council of Chief State School Officers took a relatively rosy view of the wall chart, saying the trend in the past few years has been positive. The group noted that 44 of the 50 states have made college entrance test gains since 1982 and 38 states have improved their high school completion rates since then. But <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambach </PERSON>, executive director of the council, added that `` the task ahead is gigantic,'' particularly in light of `` the urgent needs of our nation's economically disadvantaged youth and those with limited proficiency in English.'' The department noted that <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, all with relatively high poverty rates, have registered some of the largest increases in college entrance test scores since 1982. It said this shows that states with large proportions of disadvantaged sudents can make great progress. However, while <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> showed the most improvement of any state, with a 48-point gain in SAT scores since 1982, it still ranked dead last this year among the 22 states in which the SAT is the dominant test, with a score of 838. The District was second from the bottom despite healthy gains. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> tied for the top in ACT improvement, up nine-tenths of a point since 1982, but was ranked 21st of the 28 states this year where most students take the ACT. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> was came up 28th or last, with an average score of 16.2. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> also ranked last _ this time among all the states _ in per-pupil spending. The state spent $ 2,350 per student in 1988. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> was the highest at $ 8,010, followed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at $ 6,497. The wall chart also compares states on teacher salaries, pupil-teacher ratios and education reform efforts. Alaskan teachers were paid the highest in 1988, $ 40,424, while <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakotans </LOCATION> were at the bottom with $ 19,758. The national average last year was $ 28,008, up from $ 19,274 in 1982. Class size ranged from a low in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, with a student-teacher ratio of just over 13-1, to a high in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, which had 24.7 students for each teacher. The national average was 17.6. On the reform front, the department found that 23 states have minimum competency testing for graduation and a dozen have tests for grade promotion. Eight states have authority to intervene in academically bankrupt districts. Forty-four states require or will soon require new teachers to take a certification exam and three require current teachers to take such a test.

 Students said today they will hold a `` great protest'' for democratic reform now that the government has rejected their demand for recognition of new independent student unions. The government also claimed that unidentified non-students who oppose communist rule have been advising student protesters from behind the scenes, and it suggested that leading dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> might be one of them. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> denied involvement. The accusation seemed to herald government action against liberal thinkers admired by students. Such action against <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and other leading independent intellectuals followed student protests in 1987. `` Our protest tomorrow will show that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> democracy has arrived at a new stage,'' said student leader <PERSON> Wu'er </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Thursday is the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, the first pro-democracy student protests in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` Tomorrow we shall carry out a great protest with the support of the people,'' Wu'er said. `` May Fourth is a people's holiday.'' About 60 journalists for state-run newspapers announced plans for their own protest Thursday to express anger over censorship, especially tight controls over what they have been allowed to say about the student protests. The protests began April 15 and are the biggest in 40 years of communist rule, but most papers are limited to printing only brief, understated reports on the events provided by the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Tens of thousands of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> students have joined in marches, sit-ins, pamphleteering and a class boycott to press their demands for democratic reforms. Students in a half-dozen other cities have held smaller marches; some students in <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> have boycotted class. The general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, today addressed a handpicked audience of thousands of youths at a May Fourth celebration in the Great Hall of the People. He praised the 1919 protests for their contribution to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s advancement, but he said stability is what the country needs now. `` If stability is destroyed, what can be achieved?'' he said. `` Can science and democracy be achieved? They can not. All that will result is turmoil.'' Police said they would close central Tiananmen Square on Thursday, apparently in an effort to head off another demonstration there. Last Thursday, about 150,000 students and their supporters broke through police lines into the square, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s symbolic seat of power. Students from several other cities also said they planned marches Thursday in solidarity with the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> students' demands for a free press, an end to official corruption and other reforms. Government spokesman <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON> today rejected demands from the students to recognize their new independent group, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION>, and meet with members. Protest leaders had said if the government rejected the demands, they would march. Yuan told a news conference he hoped the students would not stage a protest, but he refused to say what action would be taken if they did. He repeated the government's assertion that the association and student unions set up on individual campuses are illegal. `` Behind the students are a very few people ... Trying to create social disturbances,'' <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> said. `` They try to accomplish during disturbances goals that they can not attain in circumstances of political stability.'' He stopped short of directly accusing <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, an internationally renowned astrophysicist, of advising the protesters but he questioned <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>'s patriotism: `` The role Mr. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> wants to play in the current disturbances will be decided by his words and deeds.'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, who has called for multiparty democracy, denied involvement in the protests. Yuan `` knows I have never been to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, never been to <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the last few weeks,'' he said in a telephone interview.

<TEXT>
 Some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> hope to halt President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plans to co-produce a new jet fighter with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, saying it would `` shut down American industries'' by giving vital <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology to the Japanese. But key congressional leaders said the votes may not be available to override <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s expected veto of any congressional resolution disapproving the deal for production of the FSX fighter, an advanced version of the F-16. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration sources said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is `` reasonably convinced'' that it has sufficient support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to prevent passage of the disapproval resolutions in the first place. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., has said that a two-thirds majority probably can not be mustered in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to override a veto, and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> said that was likely the case in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as well `` It's a good deal for us and we're going to do our best to hold the president's position,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> after a meeting at the White House. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he believes there are at least 34 votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to sustain a presidential veto. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the chief congressional watchdog agency, has challenged one of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's arguments for going ahead with the FSX deal. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> has concluded that much or all of the technology the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is expected to receive from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is already well known to the American aircraft industry, a congressional source told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> last weekend. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> findings, which are being provided to legislators in classified briefings this week, are expected to be reported in an unclassified version at a hearing next Tuesday of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said today. Several senators and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members said they plan an all-out attack on the co-production agreement. `` If this deal is not killed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> we are entering into an agreement with a country that has made it a prime industrial policy to shut down American industries,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill. `` We have signed an agreement with a country whose government and industries keep domestic prices high so the Japanese can sell their products lower in our country,'' he said In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the FSX arrangement will hurt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitiveness in aerospace by giving the Japanese advanced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology on the integration of aerospace systems

<HEAD>Productivity Up 0.5 Percent For First Quarter</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The productivity of American workers in the non-farm sector of the economy rose 0.5 percent in the first three months of 1989, up 0.2 percent from the first quarter of 1988, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said output in the non-farm sector rose 3.6 percent during the first quarter while hours worked increased by 3.1 percent. Significant productivity gains were reported in the manufacturing sector after a sluggish fourth quarter. The department reported productivity in manufacturing rose at a 3.8 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate in the first quarter, with output rising a substantial 4.6 percent while hours of all persons working increased just 0.8 percent. That compared to a revised productivity gain of 1.6 percent in manufacturing in the fourth quarter of 1988 and was an improvement over the 3.2 percent gain reported in the first quarter a year ago. In the non-farm sector as a whole, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that unit labor costs rose 5.2 percent in the first quarter, up from 4.1 percent in the previous three months. In the manufacturing sector, hourly compensation increased by 4.1 percent but, in a sign that wage gains made by <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> workers are lagging behind inflation, the department said real hourly compensation for the sector dropped 1.2 percent when the increase in consumer prices was taken into account. In the overall business sector _ which takes farming into account _ productivity rose 3.5 percent in the first quarter, a figure heavily influenced by the rebound from last year's drought. Productivity had declined 1.0 percent in the overall business sector in the final quarter of 1988. Today's productivity report contained a number of revisions of previously reported data for 1988. As revised, the department said non-farm business productivity rose 1.5 percent for all of 1988, with output growing by a revised 5.2 percent while hours worked increased by 3.7 percent. Also reported was a revised increase in unit labor costs for the year of 3.1 percent.

 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gypsy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said today it had unconfirmed reports that about 50 Romanian Gypsies were killed by Romanian border guards after they tried to escape to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The incident purportedly took place a month ago. The secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Gypsy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rajko </PERSON> <PERSON> Djuric </PERSON>, said the claims prompted Gypsy leaders to launch an international campaign to investigate the report. `` We do not know exactly the date or the place, but several different sources provided enough details for us to conclude that the report about this massacre is true,'' <PERSON> Djuric </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` They came to the Hungarian border at night and crossed it illegally. But, since they were anthropologically easily recognizable _ for their darker complexion _ the Hungarians turned them back,'' <PERSON> Djuric </PERSON> alleged. `` Once back on the Romanian side of the border they were mowed down by Romanian armed border guards,'' he said. <PERSON> Djuric </PERSON> called for a commission of European parliaments to help investigate the allegations and said he was alerting the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>.

The previous record for a Pollock painting was $ 5.72 million last year for his `` Frieze.'' Tuesday's sale, with total receipts of $ 78.6 million, was a record for a contemporary art auction.

<TEXT>
 Six riot police were killed and 10 critically injured today when they were set on fire by radical students, and President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> said he may impose emergency measures to end violent protests. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, in a nationally televised speech, said the government is determined to end a wave of protests that has hit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in recent weeks. He did not specify any action, but under the constitution he may rule by decree or impose martial law if he deems the nation is facing an emergency. `` If violence and illegal acts endanger democracy and the future of the country, I would be obliged to invoke emergency measures as empowered by the constitution,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said. The officers were killed during a dawn raid at <ORGANIZATION> Dongui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>, about 200 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, as they tried to break into a room on the seventh floor of the library to free five officers held hostage. Militants set fire to a barricade drenched with paint thinner as the policemen were climbing over it, police said. Several officers, wrapped in flames, leapt out of windows while others were burned or asphyxiated, said police officials who declined to be identified. National police headquarters in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> said it was the worst loss of police life in recent years. Police said some of the 10 policemen critically injured were expected to die. One student was critically hurt. All the hostages were released unharmed after professors at the private college pleaded with students, police said. They said 88 students were arrested for questioning. National Police Chief <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong-suk </PERSON> resigned. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, senior officials often resign to atone for a disaster even if it is not their fault. Also today, news reports said the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Cultural Center in the provincial city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> would be temporarily closed and moved to an as yet undetermined location. The center is a frequent target of radical students demanding the ouster of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> denied the report by the <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> news agency. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> charged in his speech that radical students are trying to stage a violent revolution and declared the government is determined to crush them. `` It has become clear that behind the flames that took the lives of young people, there are revolutionary groups which resort to violence to achieve their goals,'' he said. Opposition parties also denounced the deaths today and called for an end to political violence. Hundreds of radical students calling for <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s overthrow battled riot police around at least two <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> campuses. Protesters cheered at <ORGANIZATION> Sungkyunkwan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> when several policemen were set ablaze by firebombs, but colleagues quickly doused the flames and the officers were not hurt. Protests here rarely result in deaths. Riot police normally are armed only with tear gas and batons. Prosecutors said students implicated in today's deaths would face charges of arson, which carry a maximum penalty of death. Officials said no one had been charged. Stunned riot officers wept as the dead and injured were taken away. About 150 police officers staged a sit-down protest at <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> police headquarters to complain that senior officers mishandled the attack, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> reported. Police officials said about 700 riot police raided the private college after negotiations failed to free the hostages. Students seized the officers Tuesday after demonstrating against the firing of warning shots by police at attackers who menaced a police station Monday, police said. The students demanded police exchange the hostages for an arrested student. The Education Ministry ordered the university closed indefinitely while police investigate the incident. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has been hit by a wave of violent protests in recent weeks by radical students and dissidents demanding the overthrow of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s government. The radicals lack public support because of their extremism and violent tactics, but they have formed alliances with striking workers to step up the protests. In a related report, police said today about 3,800 police have been injured this year by firebombs, rocks, clubs and iron bars while blocking violent protesters. Police said 9,950 police were injured in 1986 and 6,701 in 1987.

 Presidential assailant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> wants to leave the country with his fiancee, says assassination expert <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> has asked to represent him. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>, 33, wants to start a new life abroad with formal mental patient <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> deVeau </PERSON>, who was found innocent by reason of insanity in the 1982 shotgun slaying of her 10-year-old daughter. `` Together they would like to go to some other country and promise they'll never return,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said in an interview Tuesday night. `` He wants to go abroad and try to live a normal life.'' He said <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>, who was found innocent by reason of insanity in the attempted assassination of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, did not specify what country he wants to live in. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> also said in the interview that he would not exploit <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> if he decides to become his attorney, despite what a hospital attorney argued. `` I've never written a book about any client of mine,'' said <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, author of books about the assassinations of President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and civil rights leader Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, who later represented King assailant <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, met with <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> for two hours Tuesday. `` He's asked me to represent him, and I agreed that I would read all of the files in his case at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeths </LOCATION> and tell him if it would be appropriate for me,'' said <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> feels his proposal to leave the hospital makes more sense than the hospital's policy of issuing weekend passes to select patients and requiring them to stay in the area. <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> received permission from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> on April 20 to start negotiations to hire <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>. Previously, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said, the mental hospital had barred him from meeting with <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>. `` The attorney for St. <PERSON> Elizabeths </PERSON> told me the reason I was seeking out his case and wanted to represent him was so I could write a book about him and exploit him,'' he said. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> emphasized that <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> made the initial contact. In addition to his quest to leave the country, <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> has two primary requests, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said _ to be returned from maximum security to medium security and to be allowed to speak with the media. In 1987, prosecutors turned up evidence <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> was corresponding with serial killer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, who was executed last year. A cache of letters about actress <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> was uncovered last summer, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. `` Each time, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeths </PERSON> administration was embarrassed when he was taken to court,'' said <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>. `` They retaliated by placing him back in maximum security.'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> told him `` it was actually stupid of him to write to <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>.'' In the case of the Foster letters, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> told him a `` guy'' kept writing him asking if he'd like pictures of Foster, and <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> finally requested the pictures in an effort to stop the letters. Prosecutors contend that <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> shot President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and three other men here on March 30, 1981, to impress Miss Foster. Asked if he was leaning toward representing <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said, `` I think he needs assistance, and I think that his rights are being violated.'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said he would make a decision within two weeks. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> is the author of `` Rush to Judgment: A Citizen's Dissent,'' the best-selling book about the <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Report into President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination, and coauthor, with <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, of `` Code Name Zorro,'' a chronicle of King's assassination.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee today began tying up loose ends in its 11-month probe of Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> by hearing from the first of a group of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> investors in a gas well that yielded huge profits for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> was the first to go before the panel, entering the hearing room in the Capitol basement with his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer, <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brand </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> and four others `` stood up'' the committee a week ago when two members traveled to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> to interview them. `` I hope they will cooperate, for the sake of getting this task completed,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., the panel's senior Republican <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said the work of inquiring into the gas well venture was tying up committee staff who otherwise could be preparing for a disciplinary hearing for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, expected to come late this month. The committee is seeking to clear up circumstances under which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his business partner, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, were brought into the well venture in <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> near the Texas-Louisiana line, and parlayed an initial cash outlay of $ 9,120 into a $ 340,000 profit in less than five months. In a 23-page defense the investors issued Monday by Brand they argued that the well was a legitimate business venture and not, as ethics committee counsel <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> argued, a potential funnel for gifts to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>.

 A white businessman tied a black farm laborer to the back of his truck and dragged him more than half a mile on dirt and tar roads until he died, a witness testified at a murder trial.

<HEAD>Botha Announces General Election For September</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> today said a general election will be held Sept. 6. He is expected to retire shortly afterward. The election will be the first in which white, mixed-race and Asian voters cast ballots on the same day for Parliament's three segregated chambers. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s black majority has no vote in national affairs and no representation in Parliament. September marks the end of the five-year term for the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and mixed-race chambers, which were estabished in 1984 following widely boycotted elections for voters of those racial groups. The most recent white general election was in 1987. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is heavily favored to retain its overwhelming majority in the dominant white chamber, where it now holds 130 of the 178 seats. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, 73, last month announced his intention to retire after the elections, although he did not set a date for the balloting at that time. He has headed the government since 1978. The new president is expected to be the national education minister, F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, 53, who succeeded <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader on Feb. 2. Many Nationalists view de Klerk as more flexible than <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and more capable of breaking the country's black-white political stalemate. While the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will seek to retain its majority, the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will be vying to the largest opposition faction. The Conservatives currently have a two-seat edge over the <ORGANIZATION> Democartic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, formed last month through a merger of three separate liberal parties.

 A Nicaraguan immigrant who won a $ 5.3 million lottery jackpot got more good news today as immigration officials reversed themselves and granted his application for political asylum. <PERSON> Justo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Somarriba </PERSON>, along with his wife and three children, had faced the prospect of having to take the money back to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> if the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> backed a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> finding that his political asylum claim was frivolous. But today <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> district director <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said he personally had reviewed the case and granted the asylum. `` This has nothing to do with the jackpot,'' <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said. `` He was a teacher in the government education department, and he resisted propagandizing on behalf of the Sandinista Marxist government.'' That could subject him to political persecution if he returned to his homeland, <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said. Even if he had n't been granted asylum, state lottery officials said he still would have gotten his half of last week's $ 10.6 million Lotto jackpot. `` Anybody who wins keeps the money,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, a lottery spokesman in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, an illegal Mexican immigrant was deported _ with his money _ after winning the lottery in that state. <PERSON> Somarriba </PERSON> received the first of 20 annual checks for about $ 264,000 at a ceremony Monday in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Somarriba </PERSON>, 30, from <PERSON> Masaya </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, a rural town about 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, entered the country by crossing the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, on March 22, 1987, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>'s deputy.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the nation. April 27 <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> -LRB- Ariz. -RRB- Citizen on abortion: The activists are so positive about abortion. They hide behind their chosen `` pro'' words, protected against doubts. Pro-choice. Pro-life. Caught between two extremes that have split the nation in a moral civil war are the majority of thinking Americans, fed up with simplistic shock rhetoric and self-serving doublespeak. Their pro-word is protest. ... Pro-abortion groups warn of `` back-alley deaths'' by abortion butchers if abortion is outlawed. They beg sympathy for the poor unwed mother or rape victim for whom an abortion is the difference between life and death of hope and opportunity. At the other extreme are the anti-abortion marchers who shock with pictures of well-advanced fetuses. They describe women who have abortions as murderers, and compare 1.6 million abortions each year to history's most appalling genocide. Both sides tell sophisticated lies. If the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allowed the states to decide ..., there would be no need for back alley deaths. ... The Missouri law being reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> does n't outlaw abortion It restricts state support. Most abortions are done in private clinics. And most women who obtain abortions are not rape victims, nor are they poor. The implication that some see abortion as a convenient birth control of last resort is morally repugnant, and belies the stereotype favored by pro-abortion propaganda. But equally unjust is the `` abortion on demand'' cliche that justifies state interference to halt alleged `` casual carelessness'' with human life and let government make our moral decisions.

The fact is, 100 days is too soon for anyone _ the president included _ to make any meaningful assessment of a new administration. In that short amount of time the president can do little more than react to situations while he tries to put his team together. Members of that new team, in the meantime, are still trying to remember the way to the nearest restroom. The measure of a presidency is how successful it is at accomplishing the goals it sets for itself, and how appropriate those goals turn out to be. The voters will be making the final assessment on that when they go to the polls in 1992.

It is now up to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to go one step more and conduct a thorough review of the need to retain these old ships like the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> in service. What we have here is World War I technology aboard a World War II ship attempting to defend a nation headed into the 21st century. The USS Iowa and its sister ships are nearing the half-century mark. The technology of those 16-inch guns requires sailors to hand carry 110-pound silk bags of gunpowder to load the guns. We do not question the unmatched capacity for sustained firepower that these ships can deliver, but the question should be asked if maybe they were better suited for helping contain brushfire wars in various parts of the globe and be replaced for general combat. For the billions of dollars we spend on defense, we think it's time we think about retiring aging battleships that present a risk of life for our own servicemen

In other states, this system has spurred greater voter participation and no increase in election fraud. The <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> makes some other good points. For example, why ca n't citizens register to vote at government agencies, as they pay for water bills or renew a drivers license? Why must voters register before a 29-day cutoff? Why are registered voters purged from the voting rolls if they have n't cast a ballot over a four-year period? The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ranks among the lowest in voter turnout among the Western democracies, but our powers-that-be are n't too worried about that. Why should they be? If the demographics of the voting public ever changed, perhaps they'd become powers-that-were. We should all be concerned that such a large chunk of society _ made up largely of the underprivileged and undereducated _ does n't vote because of the red tape and bureaucratic hassles

<HEAD>Report Says Releases Higher Than Expected at Ohio Uranium Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Radioactive releases from a government uranium processing plant in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> likely have been two to six times greater than estimated, and internal documents reveal a history of deceptive recordkeeping and inadequate pollution monitoring, a consultant reported today. The findings involve a 1,050-acre Energy Department plant at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, where federal officials have acknowledged that significant amounts of uranium particles over the years have been released into the air. The government has estimated that as much as 552,000 pounds of radioactive uranium dust may have escaped into the air from the plant, which has been producing uranium for nuclear weapons use for nearly four decades. But the report by an engineering consulting firm indicates the releases could be as great as 3.1 million pounds over 37 years, and in any case was higher than the government's worst-case scenario. The report was prepared for lawyers pressing the $ 300 million lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which operated the plant until 1985, on behalf of 14,000 people who live nearby. The suit, which alleges the plant has created a health hazard and reduced property values, is scheduled to go to trial next month. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the department would have no comment on the consultant's report because of the litigation. The <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> said it based its higher release estimates on information provided by a former plant supervisor in a court deposition and a computer analysis of levels of radioactive contaminants found in soil samples within five miles of the plant. `` The official estimates -LRB- cited so far by the government -RRB- of cumulative releases of uranium to the air from this plant are based in part on fabricated data and what plant documents themselves describe as an ` inherently deceptive' method of calculating'' some of the releases, said <PERSON> Arjun </PERSON> <PERSON> Makhijani </PERSON>, the author of the study. Among the findings cited by the report: _ Comments in a court deposition by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boback </PERSON>, former head of industrial hygiene and radiation at the plant, during about a dozen years stack filters at some buildings were not examined, but `` zero loss'' entries were, nevertheless, made in release records _ No adequate accounting was made of radioactive releases from areas not specifically monitored, although internal documents show such releases likely were significant A spot check on such releases during one month shows releaes greater than tabulated for the plant's entire 37-year history in the government estimates. _ Documents indicating that losses of uranium particles from stack scrubbers were understated because the estimates were based on highly efficient scrubbers, while internal plant memos show scrubbers often malfunctioning or in poor condition The engineering consultants also used a computer analysis of soil samples within five miles of the plant showing average levels of about eight times what would be expected if releases had been limited to the estimates cited by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

 The judge in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial said today he imposed a longer daily work schedule on the jury and said he is n't surprised the panel is in its 11th day of deliberations without reaching a verdict. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said in a court session that he initiated the move to have the jury start promptly at 9 in the morning, take a half hour for lunch and stay until 5 in the afternoon. That schedule began Tuesday. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said that due to health problems among some jurors early in the deliberations, the panel had been working more limited hours and `` they had gotten used to a shorter'' schedule. One panel member was experiencing high blood pressure and a few others had colds, but all are now in good health. The judge made the remarks in response to letters from prosecutors and <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers inquiring about various aspects of deliberations. `` I felt there was time being wasted in the sense that when they came in in the morning they were not starting as early as they could have when they arrived,'' said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. As for leaving at 4:15 in the afternoon, `` I felt I should indicate they should stay.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he does n't think it is surprising that the deliberations are growing lengthy, in view of the fact that there have been `` 67 witnesses, 41 trial days and we are dealing with over 250 exhibits.'' `` We are running out of books'' to while away the hours, prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> quipped, referring to the length of deliberations. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> responded by saying he understood there is `` a movie you could look at,'' referring to the TV miniseries on <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s life, `` Guts and Glory,'' which concluded Tuesday night. The panel of nine women and three men deliberated 7 -LCB- hours Tuesday, bringing the total spent at the end of the day since April 21 to 53. The jurors have put in six-hour workdays on three occasions since that time, but had n't gone longer than that until Tuesday. There has been no word from the jury since April 24, when the last of eight notes was sent to <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. The notes ranged from requests for paper clips to a plea for a nurse to monitor the high blood pressure of a juror. Meanwhile, 10 news organizations including <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said in a court filing they should be allowed to seek disclosure of a document in the case. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said in an April 22 ruling that the document is classified. It summarizes highly sensitive intelligence on a CIA-assisted shipment of Hawk missiles from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in November 1985. The document is being shown to the jury, but withheld from the public at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the super secret agency which collected the intelligence intercepts. Numerous court decisions `` have recognized that the press has standing to assert rights of public access to proceedings and records in criminal cases,'' said the court filing. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has been directed by an appeals court to compile a record spelling out national security concerns over possible disclosure of the document. North's lawyers referred to the stipulation in closing arguments, but the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> says the document itself must remain under seal. North used the stipulation to show <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and deputy national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> knew at the time that missiles were aboard the flight, yet agreed to cover up their knowledge from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The other news organizations seeking disclosure are <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>

 Doctors should spend more time counseling their patients on how to lead healthier lives through diet, exercise and other preventive means, a panel of health-care experts says. The report Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preventive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> also questions the value of routine screening tests and says physicians should reserve use of these procedures for high-risk patients. `` The key to improved health and disease prevention often lies in lifestyle changes made by patients rather than in the broad testing or sophisticated medical procedures performed by health providers,'' Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, task force chairman and director of primary care at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said upon release the panel's Guide to Clinical Preventive Services. About 5,000 copies of the nearly 300-page guide are to be distributed to medical educators and societies of health-care professionals. It is expected to be available in medical bookstores by summer. The guide recommends that physicians counsel their patients who smoke on how to kick the habit, their sexually active patients on how to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and all their patients to engage in regular physical activity. Doctors should also provide periodic counseling on diet and all patients should be urged to use seat belts and should be warned about the effects of drugs and alcohol, the guide says. The guide also concludes that routine chest X-rays are ineffective as a screening tool for lung cancer and that electronic fetal monitoring _ currently used in more than half of all deliveries _ should be used only for high-risk pregnancies. The panel said it is unclear whether fecal occult blood testing is an effective routine screening tool for colorectal cancer or whether digital rectal examinations are an effective test for prostate cancer in men who have no symptoms of the disease. `` Our review of the data has shown that routinely performing a uniform battery of tests on patients is often ineffective in improving health and can potentially lead to large numbers of inaccurate results,'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said that a greater emphasis on providing information and patient counseling will require changes in the attitudes of doctors and in the medical fee system. `` It's going to be a long, hard struggle,'' he said. The report made no financial recommendations, but <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said insurance companies should change how they reimburse for physician services, raising what they pay for information and counseling services in relation to surgical services, which are generally reimbursed at a higher rate. About 5 percent of federal health care dollars currently are spent on preventive services, a <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said. Dr. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary for health at <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION>, accepted the task force's report but offered little comment on its conclusions, saying that <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> will `` need a little time to consider the vast array of recommendations.'' The task force, a 20-member panel of health-care experts, was appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. It reviewed more than 2,400 scientific studies to assess the effectiveness of more than 100 clinical screening procedures for the prevention of 60 diseases and conditions.

<HEAD>Senate on Record Against Gasoline Tax Boost</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 5 grafs with gas tax vote, picking up at pvs 4th graf, Debate
on</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> went on record today against boosting gasoline taxes, as it pushed ahead with work on a budget that complies with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' deficit-reduction agreement with the White House. The anti-gas-tax amendment, approved by voice vote, expressed the `` sense of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'' that motor fuel taxes should remain dedicated to improvements in the highway and transportation system. There is no specific call for such a tax in the trillion-dollar spending plan now before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. However, sources have said the administration is considering proposing to combine a gas-tax increase with a reduction in the capital gains tax on investments in the budget to be submitted next year. While <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders accepted the non-binding gas-tax amendment without a quarrel, Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said other amendments might be used to undermine the White House agreement. In those cases, the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democrat said, `` a majority will prevail'' and the plan will survive. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, continued his criticism of the budget plan today, although he now acknowledges he'll probably vote for it. The plan contains `` those kind of assumptions that result in a budget that I do n't think has much realism to it,'' he said on `` CBS This Morning.'' Debate on the $ 1.17 trillion spending plan for fiscal 1990 began Tuesday night in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and was starting today in the House. The plan `` arrives here bloody, but I believe unbowed _ largely because it represents the very best compromise reachable,'' said Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Tenn </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that helped draft the blueprint The agreement reached last month with the White House designed to reduce the deficit by about $ 28 billion, to below the $ 100 billion limit of the Gramm-Rudman law. Critics of the agreement, and the budgets it has produced, contend that the deficit reduction it claims is mostly illusory _ since billions of dollars in alleged `` savings'' are really just accounting changes. For example, nearly $ 1 billion in payments to farmers would be made early so they occur before the start of the fiscal year. In addition, the resulting deficit projection is based on <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> economic forecasts that have been widely criticized as too optimistic. But <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> and others defending the plan said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should focus on the positive. `` It's a first manageable step toward the ultimate deficit reduction objective we all share,'' said <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, saying he hoped for `` a strong vote for passage here on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House on Tuesday told congressional leaders he hoped the budgets would be approved and lawmakers should reject `` killer'' amendments. Several, including one to send the whole deal back for further negotiations, were expected to be offered. House Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., said after the White House meeting that the budget was `` close to what the administration had asked for. He and the Democratic leaders were working to make sure no amendments in their chamber would `` upset the whole apple cart.'' Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the budget panel, said those critical of the progress made in reducing the deficit `` just do n't know the facts.'' He cited projections of a few years ago that the deficit in the current fiscal year would be $ 300 billion, nearly twice what is now expected. `` What would a big deficit deal be?'' for next year, he asked. `` Taxes,'' he said, something <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised to veto and the Democrats do n't want to embrace without presidential leadership. Actually, taxes are part of the current agreement. Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budgets include the $ 5.3 billion in unspecified new tax revenues that are in the White House agreement. The president contends most of that would be new revenue generated by reducing the tax rate on capital gains, but Democrats say they wo n't go along with that plan and suggest that alternative levies acceptable to president must be found. The plans also include other new revenues, including $ 5.7 billion from selling off government assets and about $ 2.7 billion in higher fees for government services. As called for in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> pact between the president and congressional leaders, both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budgets envision $ 299.2 billion in military spending next year, about the same as the current year. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> would be given total spending authority of $ 305.5 billion, a figure which includes some outlays which stretch past the end of the fiscal year. Foreign aid spending would be set at $ 17 billion. Entitlement programs would grow so individual benefits and cost-of-living increases would escape cuts. However, a variety of cost-cutting actions including some of those bookkeeping changes would allow for $ 8.3 billion in total savings from <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, agriculture, federal pensions, and other entitlements. In other domestic programs, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agreement set an overall spending cap, but gave no specifics, and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget committees took somewhat different approaches. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> favored education, health and veterans programs compared with more <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> emphasis on agriculture, energy and law enforcement. Once the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> complete their budgets, the two chambers must agree on a single resolution. The document then serves as the guide for the annual spending and tax legislation produced by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Third Incident of Food Tampering Reported in Illinois</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The third incident of food tampering in less than a week has surfaced in central Illinois, as pinlike objects were found in vending machine candy, authorities said today. A shoe-store employee at <LOCATION> Hickory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION>, just north of <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, bit into a piece of candy and cut his mouth on a sharp object Tuesday, said Sgt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's police. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON>, 26, spit the candy into a sink, <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> said. After waiting on customers he looked back into the sink and found metal that could have been `` a broken-off straight pin or needle,'' <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> said. A co-worker later found another pinlike object in a piece of the candy-coated peanuts, <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> said. Seven machines in the mall that serve up handfuls of the candy were locked up pending investigation, <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, investigators say they believe that pins reportedly found in <LOCATION> Heinz </LOCATION> baby food jars in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> are isolated incidents. The company's baby food was removed from store shelves in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> Tuesday after a complaint Monday night. <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> grocers returned <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> baby products to their shelves Tuesday after an incident of food tampering was reported there last week. Nobody was hurt in either baby food case. Police in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, about 35 miles east of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, said Monday that authorities had no objections to restocking because there was no evidence the tampering occurred at the point of production. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, a division of H.J. <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the criminal investigation in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> is continuing, as tampering is a federal crime. There is a `` 99-to-one'' chance that the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> complaint will be found to be isolated and a `` copy-cat'' of tampering cases in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> U.S.A. </PERSON> has no connection to the <LOCATION> Heinz </LOCATION> company affected by tampering in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where some 300 cases of contamination were reported, including food found with glass shards, razor blades and caustic soda.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, visiting his third Southeast Asian country in as many days, discussed economic issues and the future of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in get-acquainted meetings with <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials today. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was greeted with a 19-gun salute when he arrived here for a 1 -LCB- - day stay that will include a tour Thursday of a border camp for nearly 60,000 Cambodian refugees about 200 miles from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> The fate of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has been a dominant theme during the vice president's 12-day tour of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, he met with Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the Cambodian resistence leader whom the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to head a transition goverment after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdraws its occupation troops this fall. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said at a news conference today that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not consider closer diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> until that country `` removes itself from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' Part of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s responsibility on his trip is to gather ideas from other Asian nations on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and report back to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose administration is reassessing its policy towards <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. Among the options are providing military aid to the non-communist factions seeking to take over in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> explained the basic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> during a 50-minute meeting with Thai Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON> and also stressed the importance the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> places on protection of copyrights _ perhaps the only major friction in otherwise strong relations between the two countries. Earlier this year, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s major export market, denied the country $ 165 million in duty-free exports. The action was taken after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> complained the Thais had failed to honor intellectual property rights, for instance copying patented drugs. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is weighing whether to further blunt Thai exports by imposing additional trade restrictions. Thai government spokesman <PERSON> Suvit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoadmanee </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> as telling <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not take drastic action on the issue because overall relations, including anti-narcotics cooperation, were good. He noted that most recent negotiations had gone well. <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Suvit </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should regard <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> as a `` springboard'' for trade with <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and noted there was room for increases in trade and joint ventures between <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also conferred with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> and had an audience with King <PERSON> Bhumibol </PERSON> <PERSON> Adulyadej </PERSON>. The vice president and his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, were to be guests at a banquet tonight. While <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met with the prime minister, a half-dozen university students attempted to hand to the vice president an open letter protesting any implementation of further restrictions, claiming it would amount to `` overt intervention of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. Thai security kept the students from entering <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> were meeting, and the students circulated the letter among reporters and others. Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Pong </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarasin </PERSON> said he was `` more relaxed than 30 days ago after having received reports about the latest status of negotiations on trade-related issues.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> arrived here from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. He leaves Thursday for <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> where he will monitor clean-up efforts from the March 24 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> oil spill in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met with Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON> during a visit designed to strengthen ties between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the island republic. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Tuesday's meeting with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was fruitful and the two discussed `` every single issue I can imagine.'' He said he was impressed by <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s `` economic miracle ... and booming economy.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also saw <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chok </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s defense minister and deputy prime minister. At that session, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> raised the subject of the <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> government's restrictions on the circulation of the U.S.-owned <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and Far Eastern Economic Review, according to <PERSON> Goh </PERSON>'s private secretary, <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jee </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>. `` I did bring this up,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said afterward. `` We have a difference of opinion on this ... We still hope that they will change,'' but he added it was up to the <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> reiterated his government's position that foreign newspapers are circulated in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> `` not as a right, but as a privilege granted by the government on terms set by the government,'' according to <PERSON> Tan </PERSON>. The government allows papers to circulate in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> so long as they do not engage in domestic politics, <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> said. In 1987, the <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> government severely restricted the circulation of both publications, a move that prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> to shut down all distribution here. Editors from both papers have denied allegations by the <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> government that they meddled in local government. Restrictions on the press as well as human rights concerns have strained U.S.-Singapore relations at times over the past years. Last year, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> expelled an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> diplomat, claiming that he was interfering in domestic politics in his contacts with the opposition. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> denied that charge. It also has criticized <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> in the past for detaining political opponents. While in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> the vice president also played golf, his second stint on the greens of his <LOCATION> Asia-Pacific </LOCATION> trip. The round was cut short after five holes because of rain.

<HEAD>Novelist Says Science, by Ignoring Language, Is `Incoherent'</HEAD>
<HEAD>For Release 8 p.m. EST</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Novelist <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> said Wednesday that modern science is `` radically incoherent'' because it has failed to bridge the gap between mind and matter by recognizing the importance of human language. Delivering the 18th annual Jefferson Lecture of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> urged creating a new `` science of man'' that focuses on the words and meanings of language, the only place, he said, where mind and matter intersect. `` We do not find it odd that there is only one science of chemistry and neurology but, at last count, more than 600 different schools of psychotherapy, and growing,'' <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> said in text of his speech. `` We accept the explanation that, after all, the mind is vastly more complicated than a molecule of sodium chloride or even a nerve cell,'' he said. `` That may be true, but it does n't explain why the physical sciences are converging whereas the psychic ` sciences' are diverging; that is, getting nuttier,'' he said. <PERSON> Percy </PERSON>, an award-winning novelist from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and a former physician, delivered his lecture, titled `` The Fateful Rift: The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fault </LOCATION> in the Modern Mind,'' before 1,000 invited guests. The Jefferson Lecture, given by an eminent scholar every year since 1972, is the highest federal honor for outstanding achievement in the humanities. It carries a stipend of $ 10,000. <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> said science ignores or fails to deal with the relation between the human mind and the physical world. Contemporary psychology, he says, deals with visible, measurable entities such as neurons and synapses and mental phenomena such as `` self'' or `` ego'' without linking them. However, he said, `` an increasing number of people are beginning to know that a different sort of reality lies at the heart of all uniquely human activity _ speaking, listening, understanding, thinking, looking at art.'' <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> said this reality, `` man's unique behavior of language and symbol-mongering,'' eventually must be confronted by science as a natural phenomenon that explains humanity. Art, poetry and novels `` ought to be taken very seriously indeed, since these are the cognitive, scientific ... statements that we have about what it is to be human,'' <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> said. `` The humanities, in a word, are not the minstrels of the age whose only role is to promise ` R & amp; R' to tired technicians and consumers after work,'' he said. `` Rather are the humanities the elder brother of the sciences, who sees how the new scientist got his tail in a crack when he takes on the human subject as object and who even shows him the shape of a new science.''

 Thursday is `` Tax Freedom Day.'' Once you put in your eight hours, you'll be working for yourself the rest of the year. The <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> calculates the average American will have to work 124 days this year _ the same as in 1987 and 1988 _ just to pay federal, state and local taxes. Thursday is the 124th day of the year. Tax Freedom Day has never fallen later in the year. This year's date is also the same as in 1981, before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agreed on a 23-percent across-the-board cut in individual income tax rates Economists for the foundation, a nonpartisan <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> research group, say the value of that tax cut has been offset by more than a dozen subsequent federal tax increases and by higher state and local taxes caused partially by cuts in federal programs. The foundation's calculations are based on the assumption that all taxes, including those collected by businesses, ultimately are paid by individuals.

 Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> today ordered pay raises of 30 percent to 70 percent for public employees and the military after his overwhelming victory in presidential and congressional elections. The salaries of brigadier generals will jump 70 percent, from $ 448 to $ 761 a month. Captains' salaries will go from $ 248 to $ 421, and sergeants will earn $ 209, up from $ 123. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who toppled dictator <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> in a coup Feb. 3, also announced 30 percent pay raises for public employees and 49 percent increases for workers in clinics and hospitals. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> announced the retirement of up to three dozen army generals, some of them <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> loyalists, as part of a shakeup to allow younger officers to move up in rank. `` Within a few days, or within the month of May, I'll give you the list of those who have left -LRB- retired -RRB- and those who have been promoted to general,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> told reporters as he left the National Palace. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said today that of 898,829 votes counted so far, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> received 667,434, or slightly more than 74 percent. His governing <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won control of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the vote. `` I am pleased and happy that I have the affection of the people, and they showed their confidence in me,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said when asked about the results. Some losers fumed about voting irregularities, but Paraguayans seemed satisfied with the triumph of <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> aide who has respected civil liberties and promised democratic reforms since taking power. `` You could n't expect any other result because the people are very grateful to him for putting his life in danger to bring us freedom,'' said <PERSON> Susana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jara </PERSON>, 50, a fruit vendor in the public market. `` Half of the vote for <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was a ` thank you' for overthrowing <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuccolillo </PERSON>, editor of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Color that reopened last March after being shut down five years ago by the former regime. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Vera </PERSON>, presidential candidate of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Febrerista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, noted the election's many `` irregularities,'' but said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> obviously won `` by a landslide.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> has pledged to support reforms of the Constitution, electoral law and the penal code. He also promised not to seek re-election in 1993. The balloting was to choose a successor to finish the five-year terms of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, who now lives in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> dissolved after the coup. The partial, official tally gave the governing <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 67.2 percent of the vote for the 36-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the 72-member Chamber of Deputies. Unofficial tallies gave the <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION>, in power since 1947, similar winning margins. The runner-up in the presidential balloting, <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has complained of `` shameful irregularities'' in the voting. On Tuesday, he met with other party leaders to decide whether to issue a protest. Flaws cited by international election observers and party officials included lack of space for voting in private, lack of indelible ink to prevent multiple voting, and apparently illegal, last-minute registrations by the <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION>. `` The conduct of the elections was far from perfect,'' the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The group, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, noted the short time to prepare and the country's history of authoritarian rule. Widespread vote fraud occurred during the eight elections won by <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> in his nearly 35 years of rule. The inauguration of <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was set for May 15.

 These are troubled times for American apple producers, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Recent concern about apples treated with Alar and other chemicals is part of the problem for growers, but so is the expansion in apple production, both domestically and worldwide. `` Adding to the pressure, consumers could have cut demand for apples as health concerns arose of the use of the pesticide Alar,'' says economist <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON>. `` It remains to be seen if Alar use will permanently curtail consumer demand.'' Domestic demand for apples is `` relatively flat'' right now, while competition in the international market is intensifying, <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> writes in the May issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine. `` If demand does not increase, many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers may be forced to leave the business,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and other government agencies have declared the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> apple supply safe to eat. But the recent Alar scare raised questions about the safety of apples treated with the chemical, prompting a number of schools across the country to temporarily ban apples from lunchrooms. <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON>, who works for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said new plantings in the late 1970s and early 1980s are pushing up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> apple production. A new planting comes into production in 5 or 6 years and reaches nearly full capacity after 8 or 9 years. `` When the new plantings begin bearing at full capacity, output will be comparable to 1987, the largest crop in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history,'' she said. Total production in 1987 _ the marketing year runs from July through the following June _ was a record 4.8 million metric tons, up from 3.6 million tons in each of the two previous years. The preliminary estimate for 1988 is 4 million tons. <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> said the decline for 1988 is due to the drought in some areas, and because apples, like most tree crops, are cyclical. After a year of high yields, production is smaller the following year. Also, although new trees are coming into production, other orchards are growing older and are yielding less. One factor has been a deterioration in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> apple trade balance, she said. Imports reached 121,000 tons in 1987-88, more than double the volume of the mid-1970s. Part of the reason was the sharp drop in the value of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s peso against the dollar, which lowered the price of Chilean apples. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fresh apple exports rose to 305,000 tons in 1980-81 from 120,063 tons in 1976-77. However, exports declined after 1980-81 when the dollar began rising against vitually all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> apple importers. `` Exports for the 1987-88 marketing year, at 293,000 tons, were 70 percent higher than the previous year,'' <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> said. `` This was partly due to the low prices induced by the record crop and partly due to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar's decline during 1985-87.'' <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> said that a number of countries, including <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, have been boosting apple production and exports. These Southern Hemisphere producers are able to export fresh apples while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is drawing on its cold storage supplies. The major export markets for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> apples are <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, she said. In each the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> faces comptition from the three Southern Hemisphere countries. But some important markets are opening up for American producers in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> has agreed to open its market earlier for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> apples. Previously, imports were allowed only when local supplies were exhausted, usually by mid-December, <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> said. In 1989-90, the opening date will be Nov. 15, and in future years will be open year round.

 Heavy rains have helped the western Corn Belt and nothern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, but much of the sorely damaged winter wheat area is still parched from lack of moisture, says the government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility. Winter wheat was in `` mostly fair to poor'' condition during the final week of April, particularly in the central and southern areas of the plains, the facility said Tuesday in a weekly report. However, rain helped improve winter wheat in the northern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>. The facility is operated by the department's of Agriculture and Commerce. No yield estimates are included in the report's assessment of crop and soil conditions `` In <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, high temperatures and wind stressed winter wheat,'' the report said. `` Condition was mostly very poor to poor. Crop development was poor in most fields. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, winter wheat was mostly fair to poor.'' Lack of moisture continued to put stress on <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>'s winter wheat, and crop condition was reported as mostly poor to fair. Rain improved the crop in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Rain slowed planting of spring wheat, which was far behind the normal progress for this time of season. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, planting was 16 percent complete, 23 percentage points behind normal. But corn planting spurted ahead sharply, reaching 25 percent completion, a 17-point advance from the week before, the report said.

<HEAD>Artist Learns the Pitfalls of Crossing Political Barriers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> tried to teach the <ORGANIZATION> Belfast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> about art, and instead learned about the pitfalls of trying to work with all parties in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The 26-year-old artist's first commission _ a bronze sculpture commemorating the red-light past of downtown <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> _ proved too much for the city's <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> elders, and it expired in a political wrangle that fractured normal Protestant-Catholic lines. Councillor <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, daughter of Protestant firebrand Rev. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, liked it. So did <PERSON> Lily </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzsimmons </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the party that supports the overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. But other councillors protested that prostitutes were being glorified and sainted mothers insulted, or that the statue had been hijacked by <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters. `` I thought I'd done so well,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> who, dispirited by the whole experience, found solace at the Crown, a grand old gaslit pub near the place where her sculpture was to stand. Miss <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cork </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, envisioned a bronze sculpture of two women, one 7 feet tall and the other a bit shorter, both chastely dressed. The working-women theme would be expressed by making one figure out of balls of wool, knitting, a scrub brush and clothespins, and the other out of sewing machines, telephones, cash registers and typewriters. She got her first inkling of trouble when councillor <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Millar </PERSON> reviewed a model. `` I was told,'' he said, `` that the figure showed the women's breasts, but I could n't say It was made out of old bits of tin and my eyesight's not so good.'' <PERSON> Millar </PERSON>'s opinion counted because he chaired the <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which would review the proposal. Sensing danger, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> decided to take her case to every party on the committee. `` I was innocently _ I mean, quite genuinely _ trying to explain to people it was not a glorification of prostitution,'' Miss <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. She said she told the committee the sculpture aimed `` to comment on women's work: both badly paid and unpaid. The 10 worst-paid jobs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> are jobs traditionally done by women,'' and such pressures could drive some women into prostitution. One councillor who agreed was Mrs. <PERSON> Fitzsimmons </PERSON>, who saw it as `` a tribute to working-class women.'' Miss <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, herself a painter, also praised it. This uncommon agreement between a <LOCATION> Paisley </LOCATION> unionist committed to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporter pledged to driving <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> out of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, was more than <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> headline writers could resist. At that point, as the <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> political journal `` Fortnight'' put it, `` unionist knees jerked.'' <PERSON> Millar </PERSON>'s committee concluded that most people would see the sculpture as a memorial to prostitution and an insult to working women _ his mother among them _ who `` despite poverty retained high moral standards.'' That set the stage for Tuesday's battle in the council hall, whose aisle separates 51 <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> councillors into two arrays of factions which feud with each other as well as within themselves. Hard-line Democratic Unionists like Miss Paisley sit with more moderate Ulster Unionists like <PERSON> Millar </PERSON>, plus two Independent Unionists, one <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> and one Progressive Unionist. The Catholics are divided among the moderate Social Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, its avowed enemy <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, and one member of the radical left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. A half-dozen members of the Alliance, the only mixed Catholic-Protestant party, fit in where they can. Protestant councillors have been known to blow rape whistles to drown out <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> opponents, or to toss coins at each other as `` Judas'' gestures. Tuesday's session was mild by these standards, with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> excoriating <PERSON> Millar </PERSON> as well as Mrs. <PERSON> Fitzsimmons </PERSON> `` who sits with the <ORGANIZATION> IRA-Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> scum.'' `` I congratulate <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> for her work because it has exposed the stench of religious hypocrisy surrounding the arts for too long,'' Miss <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> said. `` I would prefer,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>, `` to see a statue of women bringing up children alone due to the murderous activities of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>.'' Former Lord Mayor <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said the debate `` has been full of cant and hypocrisy, and has more to do with people looking for a cheap election gimmick.'' Whatever <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> thought, <PERSON> Millar </PERSON> said her father had joined three other ministers in signing a letter opposing the sculpture. `` The letter made it quite clear it was opposed to the erection _ that was the term they used _ of the statue,'' <PERSON> Millar </PERSON> said. A motion to support the statue, and condemn <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> in the bargain, failed 22-13.

 Dozens of journalists for the official media began a petition drive Wednesday and made plans to demonstrate in an unprecedented open rebellion against government censorship. The reporters demanded the reinstatement of the editor of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most outspoken newspaper, who was fired last week. But they also called for a dialogue with government officials on broader issues of censorship, reflecting increasing dissatisfaction with a media system in which much of their work is never released. The reporters, many of whom are members of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said their action was prompted in part by tight government limits on reporting of student protests over the past few weeks. The students have called for press freedom and other democratic reforms, but only a few newspapers have reported the scale and popularity of their marches. `` We all know there is no press freedom in our country, and that we reporters all want press freedom,'' a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekly </ORGANIZATION> told a gathering of about 60 colleagues at the Lu Xun Museum in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xun </PERSON> was a short story writer and essayist famous for his sharp criticism of the government in the 1920s and 1930s. The reporters, from all of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading papers including the party mouthpiece, the People's Daily, expressed anger over the firing of <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Benli </PERSON>, editor of the Shanghai-based weekly, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> officials fired <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> for `` violations of discipline'' after he refused to alter the paper's April 24 edition. The issue contained articles that called for a reassessment of late party chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, who was ousted in 1987 allegedly for being too liberal. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> officials said the articles were `` likely to cause disturbances.'' Hu's death April 15 sparked marches, sit-ins and a class boycott by tens of thousands of college students in the largest protest in 40 years of communist rule. The reporters drafted a letter to be sent to government and party leaders demanding <PERSON> Qin </PERSON>'s reinstatement, an open apology by <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> officials and a dialogue with officials on `` illegal interference'' in reporting. `` If we can achieve our goals regarding the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, then we believe we will have advanced a step in our striving for press freedom in our country,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekly </ORGANIZATION> reporter, who like many others did not want his name used. The reporters at the meeting promised to collect signatures at their workplaces. They also made plans to demonstrate Thursday outside the offices of the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which generally sets the line for other official media to follow in reporting sensitive stories. Thursday is the 70th anniversary of a 1919 student protest that began what became known as the May Fourth Movement, a campaign against foreign imperialism and for scientific and democratic reform. It was <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first student protest. The current student protesters have carried banners declaring, `` The press should speak the truth,'' and shouted, `` The People's Daily, complete nonsense! `` It's exciting. The intellectuals in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> wo n't stand more pressure from the government,'' said a TV journalist. `` There is strict censorship every day.'' She said reports were held up for hours, sometimes days, by `` lots of officials who want to say yes or no'' on each one, even if the content is not particularly sensitive. Science and Technology Daily was the first to break a media blackout on the student protests when it said that students gathered to mourn <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> also were chanting slogans for democracy and freedom. The paper's editors agreed to publish the report only after the reporters threatened to resign en masse. The Peasant's Daily, <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and Chinese Women's News each have reported once on the protests with enough detail to give readers an idea of the unprecedented size and daringness of them. Other papers have carried only sparse, understated <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> reports. Dozens of Chinese reporters have covered the protests, but said their editors have tossed out their reports. One photographer, asked at a protest why he was bothering to take pictures, replied: `` For history.''

 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s people, statistically speaking, are a just shade older than they've ever been before, with the median age in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reaching a record 32.3 years, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. That means half of all the people living in the country were older than 32.3 years, and half younger, as of last July 1. This is up from the median age of 32.1 a year earlier. By states, in terms of the median age, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> are in the middle while the oldest Americans are in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the youngest in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. The maturing of the massive Baby Boom generation, born in the years following World War II, is raising the nation's median age, census officials and other analysts have noted. This group forms the largest segment of the population and as it ages the median age is pulled along, Census demographer <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Byerly </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. After years of climbing gradually as life spans increased, the median age reached 30 for the first time in the 1950 census, when it was 30.2 years. But then the full force of the Baby Boom began to occur and the large number of children in the population pulled the median down for two decades. In 1980, the median edged back up to 30 again and has continued climbing since then, as the Baby Boomers pursued careers and education and postponed having families, creating what some statisticians call a Baby Bust. In the last few years, total births have begun rising as aging Baby Boomers began having children, but those numbers remain too small to have a major impact on the national median, <PERSON> Byerly </PERSON> said. Retirement-haven <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> remains the state with the oldest population, with a median age of 36.4 years, up from 36.3 years in 1987. Following <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the highest median ages were reported for the large industrial states in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> second at 34.5 years followed by <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> at 34.4. Indeed, the Northeast has the highest median age of the four regions at 33.9 years. Next is the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> at 32.3 _ same as the national figure _ followed by the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, 32; and the West, 31.6. The state with the youngest residents remains <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, where half of the population is under 25.7 years, and half over. A year earlier, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s median age was 25.5. Next lowest is <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, with a median figure of 28.7 years. Two states, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, match the national median age, while the populations of 20 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> are older than the nation as a whole. The remaining 28 states have median ages younger than that of the country. Here is a look at the nation's median age through the years:

<HEAD>Productivity Up 0.5 Percent for First Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Business productivity rose at an annual rate of 0.5 percent in the first quarter of 1989, with manufacturing workers significantly increasing their per-hour output, the government reported Wednesday. Overall output in non-farm business rose at a rate of 3.6 percent in the first quarter while hours worked climbed 3.1 percent, leaving the half-percent productivity gain, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The department revised the fourth-quarter non-farm productivity gain to an annual rate of 1 percent, up from the 0.1 percent initially reported. All of the figures were seasonally adjusted. The gains were marked in manufacturing: Productivity improved 3.8 percent in the first quarter from the final three months of 1988 because manufacturing workers increased their output by 4.6 percent while the number of hours worked grew by only 0.8 percent. The data essentially confirmed figures in the government's recent reports on the gross national product and employment costs Productivity _ output per hour for all workers _ is an indicator of the efficiency of American business. Because of labor shortages, particularly in skilled jobs, economists have been predicting wages will rise faster and significant productivity gains will be needed to curb inflation. Still, there were signs in Wednesday's report that wage gains are not outpacing inflation in general. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that hourly compensation in non-farm business rose 5.7 percent in the first quarter but real hourly compensation, which takes into account the increase in consumer prices in that period, grew by only 0.3 percent. For all of 1988, hourly compensation adjusted to factor in consumer inflation rose a revised 0.4 percent, the department said. In manufacturing, real hourly compensation lagged 0.6 percent behind inflation in 1988 and 1.2 percent behind in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 1988, according to the government data. In a separate gauge, the government reported that unit labor costs _ obtained by dividing compensation by output _ rose 5.2 percent in the first quarter from the previous three months and 4.9 percent compared to the first quarter of 1988. The improved productivity in manufacturing in the first quarter included a gain of 3.6 percent for durable goods and 4 percent for non-durables. The report included revised productivity data for 1988, with the government reporting overall non-farm productivity improved 1.5 percent over the year as output increased 5.2 percent while total hours worked grew 3.7 percent. The government reported overall business productivity _ including farming _ increased at a 3.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter, but that figure is heavily influenced by the agricultural rebound after last year's drought. Productivity had declined 1 percent in the overall business category in the final quarter of 1988.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thirteen infants died in a two-week period in an Armenian hospital where cockroaches scuttled around the cabinets and doctors set mousetraps under the operating table, a newspaper revealed. In a blistering attack that accused officials of indifference, incompetence and a coverup, the Armenian newspaper <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON> said 25 children born at the <ORGANIZATION> Krupskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific-Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in the capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> had died this year, including 13 alone in the first two weeks of March. In another <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> maternity hospital, three children died because they were given overdoses of medicine, according to the April 29 edition of the newspaper that reached <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Wednesday. A government commission established that many of the infants died of infections caused by unsanitary conditions `` on the operating table, in the birth area, in areas for premature babies, on nipples, oxygen masks, breathing tubes, and even on medical lamps.'' `` Mothers say: cockroaches scuttle around the cabinets and under the operating table there is a mousetrap,'' <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON> reported. The commission determined that about half of the 13 children who died in March were among the highest-risk group of newborns, but that `` at least five or six of these children did not have to die,'' the newspaper said. It said nothing about the 12 other children born at the institute who have died this year. The paper said the institute was closed, its director, G.G. <PERSON> Okoev </PERSON>, was fired, and other senior personnel were demoted. In an earlier interview, the paper said <PERSON> Okoev </PERSON> had blamed the high death rate on the high-risk nature of its patients and a flu epidemic among the mothers. Citing the case of the three other children who were given overdoses of medicine, the newspaper demanded: `` Is this coincidence, or is it the system? A deeper and more serious discussion is needed here.'' After many years of not publishing such statistics, the official press said a year ago the infant mortality rate was about 25 per 1,000 live births. In some areas of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, it is as high as 70 per 1,000. The infant mortality rate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1986 was 10.3 per 1,000. The report came after other reports of abuse and neglect in recent months at maternity hospitals that shocked Soviets. Officials said in March that 49 mothers and babies had been infected with the AIDS virus at a hospital in <LOCATION> Elista </LOCATION> by nurses who used unsterile syringes. Soviet officials acknowledge the free system of health care often is poor, and they are putting more money aside to improve it. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency Wednesday quoted Health Minister <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON> as saying that much of that money would be targeted at care for mothers and children. `` Considering the lag of mother and child care centers, it has been decided to spend 40 percent of public health's capital investments for the development of these institutions,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It said there has been a drop in infant mortality and infectious diseases in the past two years. But <PERSON> Kommunist </PERSON> said the infant deaths at the <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> institute were not so much caused by lack of good equipment as the indifference of hospital and city health workers. `` Out of dozens of people in responsible positions, receiving a salary precisely to spot dangerous infections on time, no one saw it _ even when children started to die from it,'' the paper said. `` How could it happen that they did n't notice a group infection, and in the end the deaths of a group of children, they did n't know? Or maybe they knew, but kept silent? Maybe they simply were afraid to lose their comfortable chairs, where it is very prestigious to sit?'' it said. `` In any case, such inertia is deeply immoral, if not criminal,'' it said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> today played down an apparent disparity between his assessment of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s chances of implementing reforms and the opinion held by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The president and I were in a meeting yesterday and frankly chuckled at what has developed by way of press commentary on views that we have expressed.

The <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, who has been on the job for less than two months, created a stir last week when he predicted that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would fail at instituting reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and would be replaced by a hardliner. `` If I had to guess today, I would guess ultimately he would fail,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said in a weekend television interview. He also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not take any unilateral steps, such as removing any of the 324,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, in response to changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> quickly offered more hopeful assessments about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s liberalization efforts, although they did not publicly rebuke <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary conceded today that he `` responded previously the other day perhaps with more candor than was warranted about my view ... somewhat pessimistic concerning Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s prospect for achieving his reforms.'' `` The president has expressed the hope those reforms will be successful. We do n't see those ... as contradictory statements,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. Asked by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, whether there was a fundamental difference between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s approach to defense and his own, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> replied, `` This is his budget I presented today.''

 Desperate times call for desperate measures in the Oral <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> ministry as the elder statesman of television evangelism struggles to raise more than $ 4 million by Saturday to save his religious empire. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said in late March he had five weeks to raise $ 11 million to pay past-due bills or creditors would `` start dismantling'' the ministry. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, the evangelist's son, said more than $ 4 million still is needed by Saturday, when Oral <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduates nearly 1,000 of its 4,300 students. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> announced Tuesday he was pulling the university's athletic teams out of <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> competition and applying for admission in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intercollegiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> to save money He estimated that would save $ 500,000 to $ 1 million a year. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who once said nationally ranked <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> teams could help showcase his evangelical university, said the decision was an indication to supporters of the sacrifices necessary to save the ministry. `` When they see that I've made this painful decision, I think they will realize how serious our problem is and will come through,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Tulsa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>. The decision, effective immediately, ended the chances of post-season tournament play for the university's 36-18 baseball team, which had hopes of a regional playoff bid with six games left in the season. `` To work that long and that hard and to have an outside force come in and take it away from you, that's hard,'' said <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>, a sophomore catcher and designated hitter. `` We've been facing the worst financial crisis in the history of this ministry,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. `` We're not out here in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> crying wolf. We've got a sincere problem.'' There have been other financial crises that forced cutbacks. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> dropped the university's law school in 1985 and dental school in 1986, and turned over the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s clinic operation to an independent doctor's group in 1987 Last year the ministry took its television programs off 125 stations and the university scaled down an $ 8 million scholarship program for medical students. `` Everybody misses one large point,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Swadener </PERSON>, chief financial officer for the ministry. `` They think we like to raise money. It is absolutely the opposite. We do n't like to come to you and ask for money. We do n't like to come to you because we do n't want to be your problem We want to be your solution.'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> blames the well-publicized sins of fellow evangelists <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> for his ministry's woes. Citing a `` spirit of skepticism'' that has discouraged the once-faithful, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> claims donations have tumbled steadily since the 1987 scandal involving <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry from $ 5 million a month to $ 2.7 million. But <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> has had his share of controversy in his 41-year-old ministry, including claims of seeing a 900-foot <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, wrestling matches with the devil and a life-or-death ultimatum from God to raise $ 8 million for the medical school scholarship program in 1987. Nevertheless, the 71-year-old tent preacher who pioneered television evangelism says he is willing to pay any price to bring supporters back to his ministry. `` This is an awful thing for me to say, but I'd be willing to lose my soul, I believe, to save Oral <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who built his $ 500 million evangelical kingdom on the credo `` Expect A Miracle,'' has managed to meet the challenge more than once in the last several years. He has raised more than $ 20 million in special appeals since 1986, including his controversial $ 8 million fund raiser that ended in March 1987 after he said God would `` call me home'' if he failed. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said he believes the ministry will raise the money it needs and he still plans to leave for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> next week on a six-day trip. `` I refuse to give up. I refuse to turn loose,'' he said. `` I'm expecting a miracle for ORU.''

<TEXT>
 Cancer researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> have found positive effects from twice-a-day doses of radiation _ a variation from traditional once-a-day treatments _ combined with cancer-fighting drugs. `` It's premature to give results, but this approach of twice-a-day radiation, with or without chemotherapy, appears to be one of the most promising approaches we have,'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, a radiation oncologist, told a seminar on smoking last weekend. The researchers have been studying the new approach for those who are not good candidates for surgery since the summer of 1987. But the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> was hesitant Tuesday to endorse the new treatment, saying the benefits must be shown to outweigh the problems it could inflict. While `` it's definitely something that needs to be looked into further,'' two-a-day treatments could disrupt patient's lives by requiring them to remain hospitalized, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Kara </PERSON> <PERSON> Smigel </PERSON>. Those getting once-a-day treatment are usually outpatients and can live relatively normal lives, she said. About 155,000 people will be diagnosed with lung cancer in 1989. Of those, about two-thirds will not be good candidates for surgery. If patients receive two radiation treatments daily, lower doses may spare the tissue surrounding fast-growing cancers, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. Traditional radiation treatment for lung cancer calls for radiation once a day, five days a week, for six weeks. That, said <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, will produce a 5 percent survival rate, meaning 5 percent of the patients receiving the treatment will be alive in five years. Twenty percent will be alive after two years. The average survival will be nine months. Most people die from the spread of the cancer to other areas, such as the brain, liver and bones, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. `` I hate to get too excited too soon, but these people are doing really well,'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. `` This is probably the most exciting potential development I have seen in inoperable lung cancer in years.'' A 20-patient pilot program using twice-a-day radiation will begin in about six weeks. The next stage will be to compare standard treatment with twice-a-day radiation and twice-a-day radiation with chemotherapy. Researchers should have some idea of the effectiveness of the treatment within four or five years.

 An adult community has won the right to evict a toddler in a test of a federal law aimed at preventing age discrimination in housing. Pasco Circuit Judge <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Keough </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Malloy </PERSON> 30 days to remove his son <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON>, who turns 2 this week, from <LOCATION> Arborwood </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Summertree </LOCATION>, a 289-unit community for adults 55 and older. After a three-hour non-jury trial, <PERSON> Keough </PERSON> decided Tuesday that the subdivision fits exceptions to the newly amended Fair Housing Act, which took effect March 12, and upheld the association's age restriction as legal. The law includes exemptions for retirement communities if 80 percent of the households have at least one person age 55 or older and if facilities and services are provided for them. Arborwood attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Brudny </PERSON> said the subdivision meets both requirements. <PERSON> Malloy </PERSON> represented himself, saying he could have afforded a lawyer but chose not to do so because others similarly affected might not be able to afford one. `` To decide on their part, you're deciding against all the people that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> tried to protect with this law. And you're also deciding against all the people 55 and up who like children,'' <PERSON> Malloy </PERSON> told the judge in his closing agrument <PERSON> Malloy </PERSON> said he will honor the order and expects to move to another home five miles away he has arranged to buy. He originally bought the $ 90,000 Arborwood home for his 80-year-old father, who died in December 1985 before the house was finished. <PERSON> Malloy </PERSON> said he and his son moved to <PERSON> Arborwood </PERSON> last June after he divorced the boy's mother. He said he lived there two weeks before receiving notice from the homeowners group to move. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Keough </PERSON> rejected a bid by the association to evict the child and said the subdivision's original restriction against minors _ residents younger than 18 _ would become illegal when the fair housing law took effect. The Arborwood association amended its bylaws to become a 55-and-older community.

 The former chancellor of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, continues to receive his $ 6,800-a-month salary, 10 months after being convicted of embezzling $ 250,000 in campus funds.

Many professors and students have expressed outrage that the university continues to pay Huttenback. `` This year there are 2,400 freshmen who are unable to take required freshman English courses because the university is too short of money to provide those courses,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiff </PERSON>, who teaches freshman composition. `` So it's terribly puzzling and distressing to pay a convicted felon for not teaching.'' `` It's disgraceful that we continue to pay a man who has been convicted of stealing from us,'' said student body President <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFianza </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, chairman of the five-member <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Privilege </ORGANIZATION> and Tenure, said the panel has not made a recommendation on <PERSON> Huttenback </PERSON> because `` this is a very complicated matter that has to be done with a great deal of thought.'' <PERSON> Huttenback </PERSON> resigned as chancellor in July 1986 but continued to teach history. He was later convicted of embezzlement and income tax evasion in connection with embezzling school funds to make repairs at his home. He was fined $ 60,000, placed on five years' probation and ordered to perform 1,000 hours of community service. He is appealing his sentence.

<HEAD>Consultant Says Dust From Plant May Be Much Greater than Estimated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The amount of radioactive dust released from a uranium-processing plant in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> may be two to six times greater than estimated because of `` inherently deceptive'' record-keeping, a consultant said Wednesday. The consultant's report was prepared for a lawsuit to be heard next month against the former operator of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plant at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where the government says an extensive cleanup effort will be required over the next decade. The plant, on 1,050 acres 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, has processed uranium for nuclear weapons since 1952 during which the government estimates as much as 552,000 pounds of radioactive uranium dust may have been released into the air. But a report released Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> said the government estimates are far too low based on evidence gathered as part of the lawsuit from depositions and internal plant documents. <PERSON> Arjun </PERSON> <PERSON> Makhijani </PERSON>, an engineer and co-author of the report, said as much as 3.1 million pounds of uranium particles may have been released from the plant since it opened in 1952. Even using conservative estimates, the releases likely significantly exceed the government estimates, he suggested. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the department does not necessarily dispute the group's figures, but will not agree with them either. She said the department does not want to discuss the new findings in detail because of the trial scheduled to begin June 5. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the plant's current operator which officially took over operation in January 1986, declined comment on the consultant's report until the company can get a copy and read it The suit alleges that National Lead of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which had operated the plant, created a health hazard and reduced property values near the plant because of the release of radioactive particles. <PERSON> Makhijani </PERSON> said the higher estimates of radioactive releases over 37 years of plant operation are based on internal plant documents and statements by officials and a computer analysis of radioactivity levels in soil within a five-mile radius of the plant. `` The official estimates -LRB- cited so far by the government -RRB- of cumulative releases of uranium to the air from this plant are based in part on fabricated data and what plant documents themselves describe as an ` inherently deceptive' method of calculating'' some of the releases, wrote <PERSON> Makhijani </PERSON>. The report cited a court deposition by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boback </PERSON>, former head of industrial hygiene and radiation at the plant, that stack pollution filters regularly were not examined during long periods of time, but `` zero loss'' of radioactive particles nevertheless were entered into release records. The report said no adequate accounting was made of radioactive releases from areas not specifically monitored, although internal documents show such releases were much greater than estimated by the government. One memo cites extensive concern about radioactive dust leaking from equipment in areas not officially being monitored. `` A bucket was placed under the largest leak to help contain the spilled dust'' from one piece of equipment, a memo says. A spot check showed releases from unmonitored areas in a single month to exceed all releases attributed to such sources by the government over the entire 37-year period, the report said. The report said releases from stack scrubbers were based on an assumption that they were highly efficient and in good working condition, although internal documents show scrubbers in disrepair and corroding. `` We have long suspected that the stack and scrubber losses from Plant 8 -LRB- one of the buildings at the facility -RRB- are far greater than are reported by the Health and Safety Division,'' said a June 4, 1964, plant memo cited in the report. A 1970 memo referred to problems with another scrubber which, it said, was `` badly corroded and does not perform required scrubber functions.'' A computer analysis of soil samples within five miles of the plant, conducted as part of the consultant's investigation, indicated levels of radiation on average eight times greater than would be expected with the levels of release cited by the government, said <PERSON> Makhijani </PERSON>.

 Importing books and other publications to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is `` purely a commercial'' proposition, unhindered by political considerations, a high-ranking Soviet official said Wednesday. <PERSON> Dmitry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamleev </PERSON>, deputy head of the Soviet state committee for publishing and the book trade, also said exchanges between Americans and Soviets in the publishing world are booming thanks to glasnost. `` There is no problem with political issues now,'' <PERSON> Mamleev </PERSON> said at a news conference during a 35-nation forum on the flow of information between East and West. `` This is purely a commercial issue now.'' <PERSON> Mamleev </PERSON>, who introduced himself as a journalist, said 12 joint ventures have been created recently for distributing books. He cited only Soviet-Polish and Soviet-Bulgarian examples of cooperation, however. He denied that censorship existed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, saying the only ban was on publication of state secrets. Due to glasnost, the new Soviet policy of openness, all publishing houses were `` independent,'' he said. Despite a paper shortage, he said, 2 -LCB- billion books and 84,000 new titles were being published every year. Speaking of exchanges with Americans, <PERSON> Mamleev </PERSON> said, `` two years ago we started at a level below zero _ today I do n't know how many of my publishers are in the States, there are so many.'' As part of the limited importation of foreign magazines and newspapers begun last fall, he said 1,000 copies of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> recently went on sale. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> is set to follow and his committee is negotiating an exchange of the science magazine Omni for its Soviet counterpart, Science in the U.S.S.R. Until recently, Soviet customs inspectors searched the bags of arriving tourists to confiscate Western publications. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation member <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> criticized the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s decision to allow the public to attend the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> International Book Fair in September for only two days of its seven day-run. Ms. <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> expressed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern that `` this period will not be long enough to accommodate the many Soviet citizens who depend on this biennial event to acquint themselves with world literature.'' She also cited the case of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryabakon </PERSON>, a Russian Orthodox Christian, whose religious literature was confiscated upon his return to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in December, despite official <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media articles announcing the lifting of all limitations on importing such material. She said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegates hoped that the positive changes toward freedom of expression seen in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and `` to some extent'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would also reach other <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries where they were needed, such as <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today ruled out negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on short-range nuclear missiles, saying such talks `` would be a mistake.'' He said the weapons must be kept in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and made more powerful in order to deter Soviet attack. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outlined his position to Prime Minister <PERSON> Gro </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlem </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> in an hour-long White House meeting. She stressed a need to find `` commmon ground'' with West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, who wants the missiles scaled back and eventually eliminated. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, suggested the disagreement was not likely to be resolved before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and the leaders of the 14 other <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> countries attend a summit meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> May 29-30. `` We will continue to discuss it but we are very firm in our position,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The centerpiece of the summit is celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Western alliance. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` we will have a healthy debate'' if a solution remains elusive. But, he said, `` I do n't think it will damage the basic strength of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>.'' Quoting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the spokesman said the president had told the Norwegian leader that the short-range <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> missiles were `` essential'' to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy of deterring an attack by the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact and that `` such systems must be kept up to date.'' Moreover, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> that `` entering into arms control negotiations on short-range nuclear forces with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would be a mistake.'' The statement appeared to rule out negotiations to eliminate the Lances under any circumstances. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said there could be no consideration of such talks at least until after the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> reduced its conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON>, taking an optimistic view, had predicted after seeing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies would find a `` common ground'' between conflicting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and West German positions on the short-range nuclear missiles. `` I tried to listen very seriously to the concerns and the positions of the American administration,'' the Norwegian leader said. While <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> shares the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> view that the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's edge in conventional weapons should be trimmed, Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> made it clear her government is closer to the West German stand on the missiles. `` I think he knows that,'' she said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose hopes for a successful first summit meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies, scheduled for Brusssels May 29-30, are clouded by differences with West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to more than triple the range of U.S.-built Lance missiles in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, who is up for re-election next year before a disarmament-inclined electorate, wants the program delayed and negotiations held between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to scale back short-range nuclear rockets. `` I think we will see the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit will find common ground by continuing discussions in the weeks before that meeting,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> said. If not, the Norwegian leader said, the 16 allied leaders could accomplish the task in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. `` There is always something left for political leaders to do,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> said the elements of a compromise should include a `` linkage'' between non-nuclear and nulcear weapons. `` We have to be very clear in our requirements to the Soviets on reducing conventional arms,'' she said. The prime minister said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration felt it had been taken by surprise by the West German demand for speedy negotiations over the Lance missiles. `` But these change are a fact and I think we need to find common ground,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said on Tuesday the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was considering a compromise in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would develop a non-nuclear missile jointly with the West Germans. This would require a reversal of a decision by <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> in February to stop research and development on the FK90 missile, which was classified as a tactical weapon with a range below 300 miles. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the missile could target <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact airfields and other military installations now targeted by the Lances. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said development of the non-nuclear missile was under consideration at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> and at the Pentagon. `` It would give us greater flexibility,'' he said. Another option under discussion within the alliance is a declaration at the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> summit meeting May 29-30 proposing to scale back the Lance missiles _ but only after their range is more than tripled and provided the Soviets reduce their short-range rockets, as well. Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> said at a news conference Tuesday that `` what we need now is to look for the common ground, to look for what will be a sensible and coherent way of addressing the issues both of arms control and disarmament.'' The prime minister said her government's position is that `` all kinds of weapons'' should be on the table in arms control and disarmament talks. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> has lined up with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in seeking a delay in extending the range of the Lances to about 250 miles. Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> also would like to see <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s agenda expanded to deal with environmental and energy problems. `` We will all be hurt by climate and atmosphere changes wherever we live on the globe,'' she said.

 Sometimes Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> seemed more like Wide World of Sports than a diplomatic mission Once, he kept <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s minister of tourism waiting for nearly two hours at the <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> airport because he and his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, wanted to squeeze in some last-minute tennis at a <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> resort in northeast <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s favorite sport is golf, which stood him in good stead in golf-crazy <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. After he played five holes in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON> quizzed him on his golf backround. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a well-above-average golfer, said he first handled a club when he was 10. By the time he was 20, he allowed, he knew he'd never make pro. The Quayles also donned wetsuits and strapped oxygen tanks on their backs to try scuba diving in the brilliant waters of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s coral-rich Great Barrier Reef. They were so hooked on the sport, they opted for a second dive. In <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> jogged around the city's botanical gardens, stopping to chat with the locals. And in an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> tradition, he started his 12-day trip with a 3 a.m. pickup basketball game at <ORGANIZATION> Hickam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is vice president now, but the former <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator has n't forgotten his Hoosier roots. Asked by an Australian reporter where the word `` Hoosier'' originated, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> responded: `` That's important. ... Let me answer that ... I'll give you a little advertising here.'' Launching into a description of the state - `` five-and-a-half million people, we do n't produce a lot of wheat'' _ <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> gave one of the many versions of where the word came from. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Hoosiers </ORGANIZATION> were a family who worked on a railroad in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> in the 1800s. `` Anytime that they really wanted to get the job done, he -LRB- the boss -RRB-, would always say, ` Give me my Hoosier gang,' which meant the people from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>.'' `` They were hard-working, effective, brilliant people like you are seeing right here,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said as the crowd roared. So, interjected the questioner, `` It's got nothing to do with ` Who's you mother?''' By coincidence, one of the movies available on the cable channel where <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s staff stayed in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, was `` Hoosiers,'' spelled `` Hossiers'' on the schedule.

 While <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met officials in government buildings, his wife often went her own way, visiting historic cultural sights. `` If you want to go out and see the country, go with <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters at the start of his 27,000-mile trip. He was right. Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, traveling abroad with her husband for the first time since he became vice president, toured a sultan's palace in <LOCATION> Jogjakarta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>; learned about aboriginal art at <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s national gallery in <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION>; gazed at the emerald <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON> inside a gilded temple at the Grand Palace in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, and climbed to the top of the 9th century <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temple at <LOCATION> Borobudur </LOCATION> in central Java There, she stuck her arm though a stone cage to touch the hand of a carved <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON> inside. `` It's for success in life,'' she proclaimed.

 <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, 42, prides himself on his stamina, but he acknowledged he felt the effects of his `` if it's Wednesday, it must be <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>'' trip at times. On his second day in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, the vice president was asked what surprised him most about the place. `` I suppose the most surprising thing, and I've only been here less that 24 hours, was how tired I was last night,'' he responded. Later, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he'd taken sleeping pills the first couple of nights of the trip to cope with jet lag. Counting four brief stops in cities in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory before he reached <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was visiting 13 places in 12 days, flying 27,000 miles.

<HEAD>More Than 3 Million Aliens Apply for Permanent U.S. Residency</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A year after the amnesty application deadline for illegal aliens, immigration authorities are preparing to process 3.1 million requests from foreigners asking to become permanent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents The <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is gearing up for the second phase of the amnesty program amid charges from advocacy groups that it is not doing enough to inform aliens of their obligation to apply for permanent residency if they want to stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> legally. But <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials say 60 percent of those already eligible to apply for permanent residency have done so and they expect 97 percent to do so by the end of the program. Some advocacy organizations contend that <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> should do a better job of notifying eligible aliens they must apply for permanent residency or face deportation. `` There is a big concern that people will unwittingly lose their chance for permanent residency because they do n't know they have to take the next step,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Helton </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. But a year after it stopped taking amnesty applications for temporary residence on May 4, 1988, closing the 12-month application period, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> says it is well prepared to process the papers of the millions of aliens who will eventually become eligible to apply for permanent residency. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has received 3.1 million applications for amnesty under the general legalization and the special agricultural worker provisions of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. So far it has approved nearly 1.8 million applications for temporary residency, while denying about 70,000. Legalized aliens become eligible to apply for permament resident status 18 months after their temporary residency is approved by the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>. The aliens then have a year to submit their applications and could become subject to deportation if they do not file the necessary papers on time. At a briefing Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> told reporters that `` applications for permanent residency are on the rise,'' with about 269,000 returned so far. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said the process is being simplified to allow those with temporary resident permits to submit their applications at any time rather than waiting 18 months. `` This provides additional time in which to file for permanent residency and removes any possibility of confusion,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials also dispute contentions that its notification program is insufficient. The elaborate $ 11 million public relations campaign waged two years ago to announce the amnesty program was necessary because `` we were trying to hit a target behind a smokescreen,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, associate <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> commissioner for examinations. With computerized mailings, however, general advertising appeals are no longer necessary because `` we are reaching out directly to these people,'' <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said. Of the people who became eligible to apply last November for permanent residency, 70 percent have submitted their applications, he said. Overall, the application rate is 60 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> projects that 97 percent of eligible aliens will eventually apply to stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> credited sanctions against employers who hire illegal aliens with what he called a significant drop in arrests along the U.S.-Mexican border. In the year before the immigration law was enacted, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agents arrested 1.6 million illegal aliens trying to cross the southern border. The arrest rate is about one-third lower this year than last, when 940,670 people were stopped at the border. The trend `` continues to demonstrate that the law is working,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. So far, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has issued 4,016 citations to companies alleged to have hired illegal aliens and has assessed more than $ 7 million in fines, he said.

<HEAD>Study Says Alternate Fuels for Cars Could Boost Risk of Global Warming</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Using fuels such as methanol instead of gasoline to power cars could boost the risk of global warming, according to a study given to automotive engineers Wednesday. The study said that stringent government controls on emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases contributing to warming of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, combined with policies discouraging travel by car, could lessen the impact of alternate fuels on the climate. The study by independent consultant <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> was presented at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. Alternate fuels such as methanol are derived from coal, natural gas and plants and are used instead of gasoline to fuel cars. Vehicles able to burn such fuels have been built as prototypes by major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers. However, some alternatives to gasoline create high levels of carbon dioxide when burned. That gas, along with others, can inhibit the movement of the sun's heat from the atmosphere back into space. Some scientists have predicted that if present trends continue, the Earth's atmosphere will have warmed on average by several degrees by the middle of the next century, with possible devastating effects on agriculture and the environment. Alternate fuels `` could increase carbon dioxide emissions substantially,'' the study said. `` The reason is that coal could be used as a feedstock to manufacture methanol, and if it were to do so, overall carbon dioxide emissions would approximately double per mile driven, assuming that vehicles achieved the same energy efficiency as with conventional fuels.'' Moreover, the adoption of methanol commercially would encourage continued use of fossil fuels and discourage research into electrical power plants and other alternatives, the study said. The study said the increased carbon dioxide output could be countered by adopting standards to lower emissions by the world's vehicles by 20 percent in the short term and 50 percent over a longer term Also, the study said energy prices should be gradually increased significantly to hold down growth in the number of vehicles and to `` encourage individuals to purchase highly efficient vehicles and fuels and to make -LRB- a -RRB- lifestyle decision which will tend to minimize vehicle travel as well as other energy uses.''

<HEAD>Orange County Asks Disney to Pay $32.5 Million for Roads</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> wants <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> to pay $ 32.65 million to help improve roads heavily used by tourists traveling to the entertainment empire. Disney called the request `` unacceptable'' but agreed to negotiate with county officials Wednesday under a growth management agreement with its major host county. `` Disney's research says that everyone goes to <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>,'' said County Commissioner <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Donegan </PERSON>, adding that it's time for the company to `` ante up.'' The five-year road improvement plan proposed by County Attorney <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> is the latest effort to get <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> to pay for service demands the county contends are primarily caused by a construction boom at the 43-square-mile tourist resort. Disney pays no impact fees for roads or services because of a special state law giving it autonomy from state or county regulations. Unlike other commercial developers, it does not have to submit its building plans for state or county review. Disney officials contend its huge complex _ which contains Magic Kingdom, Epcot Center, the new Disney-MGM Studios and numerous hotels, restaurant and shops _ is self-contained. It builds and maintains its own roads and operates its own sewage and water systems and fire and security services. <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> said the $ 22 million it pays in property taxes to the county each year is sufficient because it needs few, if any, county services. The county attorney said the $ 32.65 million would represent three-fourths of the expenses for widening and improving four sections of two roads leading to the resort. The county would pay $ 11.5 million for construction because some of the traffic is not heading to <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Pope Says Children Dying as Countries Try to Repay Debts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Wednesday lamented that children are dying in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the Third World because their governments are forced to spend their scarce cash on debt repayment. In a speech to diplomats, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> appealed for `` new and courageous'' action by creditor nations to ease the multibillion-dollar debt burdens of the world's poorest nations. The pope also kept up his attack on apartheid, appealed for international support for the plan for Namibian independence and urged solidarity with refugees. On the sixth day of his nine-day African pilgrimage, the pope also flew to the depressed <LOCATION> Copperbelt </LOCATION> mining region in central <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, and warned youths in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>'s sports stadium about materialism and marijuana smoking. On the debt problem, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> urged `` mutual understanding and agreement'' between the debtor and creditor nations. He stressed that creditor agencies should show sensitivity to the hardships faced by debtors. `` Is it merely a rhetorical question to ask how many infants and children die every day in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because resources are now being swallowed up in debt repayment?'' he said. `` Now is the time for a new and courageous international solidarity, a solidarity not based on self-interest but inspired and guided by a true concern for human beings.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said efforts by developed and creditor countries to relieve debt repayment burdens were `` a step in the right direction,'' but that `` much more remains to be done.'' The pope's message is particularly relevant in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The continent, comprising 28 of the world's poorest nations, recorded an external debt of $ 230 billion in 1988. <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> alone has $ 5 billion in foreign debts. Turning to southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said the `` world looks with hope'' to the U.N.-backed plan for independence of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, which has been under South African control for 74 years. In a related accord, South African and Cuban troops are to be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. While <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> began a transition period toward independence on April 1, the plan was jeopardized when black nationalist guerrillas crossed the border from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, leading to new fighting. `` To all those who head hear my voice I make an appeal that <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, the latest country in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to become independent, be fully accepted into the family of nations, that it be sustained in its independence and given every assistance on the road to economic, social and political autonomy,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who had denounced apartheid on Tuesday, returned to the issue, describing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of racial separation as a `` moral problem.'' `` Discrimination must be overcome not through fresh violence but through reconciliation,'' he said. The pope also lamented the `` tragic situation'' of those who are forced to flee their homelands because of famine, war or terrorism. `` The plight of millions of refugees in different continents is a festering wound which typifies and reveals the imbalances and conflicts of the modern world,'' he said. The pope praised <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> for caring for refugees from surrounding countries. He also celebrated Mass at an abandoned airport in <LOCATION> Kitwe </LOCATION>, the country's second-biggest city. Once a thriving region, the <LOCATION> Copperbelt </LOCATION> declined after copper prices dropped in the 1970s. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> moved through the crowd of 100,000 in his `` popemobile'' as church choirs sang Bemba-dialect hymns. In the distance, a copper smelting plant billowed black smoke into clear tropical skies. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> paid homage to the European missionaries who brought Christianity to <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> nearly 100 years ago, and he blessed the foundation stones of six new churches. After returning to the capital, he addressed tens of thousands of youths at Independence Stadium, named for <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1964. `` True progess is not to be measured by a greater number of cars or radios,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said, `` but by the way in which the poor and neglected are treated ... <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> does not offer you a ` quick deal' or flashy clothes. Referring to the marijuana plants commonly found in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, he said, `` Dagga smoking is an escape.'' The pope, who earlier visited <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island of Reunion, leaves Thursday for <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>. He returns to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> Saturday.

 A study questions the conventional view of how mammals keep the biological clock in their brains synchronized with the 24-hour day, researchers say. The so-called circadian clock governs a host of body processes, and disruptions lead to such conditions as jet lag and some cases of insomnia. Scientists generally believe that in most mammals, the brain maintains the clock's 24-hour rhythm chiefly by monitoring light and darkness in the environment. But the new study found that onset of darkness failed to exert its usual effect in hamsters if the animals were immobilized. So the real clock-setting mechanism may be the physical activity that darkness usually causes in hamsters, researchers suggested. The work is presented in Thursday's issue of the British journal Nature by <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Turek </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and O. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeth </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brussels </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. The paper `` is going to generate considerable controversy over the next year,'' commented <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON>, director of the chronobiology and behavioral pharmacology laboratory at the Sleep Research Center of the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. But he said its relevance to humans was not clear. The experiment has only been done in hamsters, he stressed. He also said that in humans, social interaction and the scheduling of mealtimes strongly influence the setting of the clock. He said previous research, including his own, has shown that the scheduling of physical activity can reset the clock in animals. Nobody knows whether that strategy can affect the human clock, he said. In the Nature paper, Turek and <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeth </PERSON> reported that unrestrained hamsters showed the usual changes in their 24-hour activity schedules in response to darkness or injections of the sleeping-pill drug triazolam. Either treatment causes a burst of physical activity in hamsters, and can advance or delay the clock setting, depending on the time in the 24-hour cycle at which it is given, they said. In contrast to its effect in humans, triazolam increases physical activity in hamsters, as does darkness. Either treatment can advance or delay the clock setting, depending on the time in the 24-hour cycle at which it is given, researchers said. But when animals were immobilized, the effect of darkness was eliminated and the impact of triazolam was largely absent, they reported. Hamsters were immobilized by placing them in a transparent tube. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> said it is not clear whether the clock is affected by the physical activity itself, or the heightened wakefulness that accompanies the activity.

 An assassin killed a Palestinian security man Wednesday, the day after <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s personal representative was critically wounded in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, which has become <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s main power base in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Police said <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hourani </PERSON>, 30, was shot to death on his motorcycle near the <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> vegetable market. <PERSON> Hourani </PERSON> was a second lieutenant in <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the guerrilla faction led by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` The assailant, firing an automatic rifle, riddled <PERSON> Hourani </PERSON> with several bullets in the head and chest,'' said a police spokesman, who can not be identified under standing rules. `` Death was instantaneous. The assailant escaped.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s representative, <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON>, 48, was shot down in a gift shop Tuesday by a man who wore a plastic mask. The assailant escaped. Police said they had no explanation for the attacks on Palestinians that began with the grenade fired at the home of <PERSON> Zeid </PERSON> <PERSON> Wehbi </PERSON> on Saturday. Two passers-by were wounded. No group claimed responsibility for any of the three attacks, but <PERSON> Wehbi </PERSON> blamed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the attempt on <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Ghassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammoud </PERSON>, one of three surgeons who operated on <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, said he was making `` remarkable progress'' afer the removal of the bullet, which pierced the left side of his forehead. `` He's in a coma, but not a deep coma,'' <PERSON> Hammoud </PERSON> said. `` The improvement in his condition was unexpected, considering his condition when he was brought in. Yesterday, his right side was completely paralyzed, but today there's only a little paralysis left on the right arm.'' <PERSON> Salem </PERSON>'s wife, Jihad, said: `` When he hears my voice, <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> opens his eyes as if in recognition.'' Her brother, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Salameh </PERSON>, was killed 10 years ago in a <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> car bomb explosion blamed on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents. <PERSON> Salameh </PERSON>, known as <PERSON> Abul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, led the the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> security organization Force 17. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> security department, and the leftist Lebanese Nasserite militia that governs this ancient port city 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said they were conducting a joint search for <PERSON> Salem </PERSON>'s attacker A source in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> said privately that several people had been apprehended, but he would not give details. <PERSON> Wehbe </PERSON> said the attack on <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> was intended to `` deal a blow to <LOCATION> Lebanese-Palestinian </LOCATION> coexistence in the <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> region'' and `` such operations are carried out only by the Israeli Mossad'' secret service. Another <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official said, on condition of anonymity: `` They're all being plotted in the same kitchen It may be Mossad or not.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, on an official visit to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, called the attempt to kill <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> `` a message for us to put up our hands and stop helping our <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> brothers.'' Christian-controlled radio stations in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> interpreted the remark as an accusation against <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, whose soldiers are fighting Christian units of the Lebanese army. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, a foe of Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, has declared support for the Christians. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has about 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s sectarian civil war began in 1975.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> held get-acquainted meetings Wednesday with <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials and will get a first-hand look at the plight of Cambodian refugees Thursday when he winds up a 12-day foreign trip. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> flies to the embattled Thai-Cambodian border, where he will visit Site B, a sprawling camp inhabited by nearly 60,000 refugees under the control of guerrillas fighting the Vietnam-backed <ORGANIZATION> Phnom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penh </ORGANIZATION> government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The vice president, accompanied by his wife, is on the last leg of a 12-day tour of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s fate has been a dominant theme during the trip. Site B is the major camp controlled by forces loyal to Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the leader of a three-party resistance coalition currently negotiating with the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government to end a decade-long guerrilla war which began after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978. In <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, whom the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to head a transition government after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdraws its troops this fall. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told a news conference Wednesday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not consider closer diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> until that country `` removes itself from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' After his arrival in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, his third Southeast Asian country in as many days, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> explained the basic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> during a 50-minute meeting with Thai Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON> and also stressed the importance the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> places on protection of copyrights _ perhaps the only major friction in otherwise strong relations between the two countries. Earlier this year, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s major export market, denied the country $ 165 million in duty free exports. The action was taken after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> complained the Thais had failed to honor intellectual property rights. Unlicensed reproductions of American video movies, music cassettes, designer clothes and computer software are made and openly sold in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. American pharmaceutical products are similarly manufactured and distributed <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials say laws exist to protect intellectual property but enforcement is still difficult. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, however, is considering further and stiffer retaliatory measures. Thai government spokesman <PERSON> Suvit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoadmanee </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> as telling <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> that good bilateral relations should not be marred by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> taking drastic action on the issue. He noted that the most recent negotiations had proceeded well. While <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met with the prime minister, half a dozen university students attempted to hand <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> an open letter protesting further <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> economic retaliation, claiming this would amount to `` overt intervention of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s internal affairs.'' Thai security kept the students from entering <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> were meeting, and the students circulated the letter among reporters and others. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also met with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON>, and had an audience with King <PERSON> Bhumibol </PERSON> <PERSON> Adulyadej </PERSON> and members of his family. The vice president and his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, were then hosted at a dinner banquet. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> leaves <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> Thursday for <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> where he will monitor clean-up efforts from the March 24 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> oil spill in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Rehnquist Tries to Rally Congressional Support for Judges' Pay Raise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, in an extraordinary personal appearance before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, tried to rally support Wednesday for raising federal judges' salaries 30 percent. Becoming the first chief justice in some 50 years to testify before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> acknowledged that many Americans think federal judges already are paid handsomely. But he called current judicial salaries inadequate and said they would cause `` more resignations from the bench, more damage to the morale of those judges who remain and more difficulty in recruiting new judges.'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that a 30 percent pay hike is needed immediately, but Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Mich., indicated the committee is not likely to take any action until next fall at the earliest Proposed legislation, backed by the Rehnquist-chaired <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Judicial Conference, would provide federal judges with a 30 percent pay raise and regular cost-of-living adjustments. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed a 25 percent increase along with a ban on speaking fees and a limit on outside earned income. A 30 percent increase would boost the chief justice's annual salary from $ 115,000 to $ 149,500. Salaries of <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices would rise from $ 110,000 to $ 143,000; appeals court judges from $ 95,000 to $ 123,000; and trial judges from $ 89,500 to $ 116,500. There are about 700 active federal judges. About 300 others are on senior status, doing as much or as little work as they wish. All receive the same raises. Responding to committee questions, <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said, `` I realize that many people have difficulty understanding why people making $ 89,000 need 25 or 30 percent more ... I have wracked my brain -LRB- about -RRB- how to get this over to the American people.'' He added, `` I hope I have not overstated the case ... Judges are n't constantly saying, ` How am I going to pay the rent.' That's not what's happening. <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> called the proposed pay increase `` a partial recapture of the tremendous decline in purchasing power that has affected judicial salaries over the last 20 years.'' He added, `` I know there may be a feeling abroad that lawyers make too much money, but so long as judges are recruited from lawyers we must take into consideration the fact of how much lawyers are paid.'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said current judicial salaries may not attract lawyers from the nation's larger cities because they can earn much more in private practice. `` I fear that is what is beginning to happen,'' he said. Several committee members were clearly sympathetic. Rep. <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Morella </PERSON>, R-Md., said `` federal judges are among the lowest paid attorneys in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s legal system today'' when age and experience levels are considered Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said, `` There's no question that the need is there. I think the judges deserve a raise.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., pointedly told <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, `` This country has a great economic problem. Noting that representatives of the executive and legislative branches had preceded the chief justice in seeking support for wide-ranging pay increases, <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said, `` This hearing is the closing of the greed cycle. I find this tragic.'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> also emphasized the importance of routine cost-of-living adjustments in judicial salaries, which he said `` could well obviate the need for the sort of sizable ` catch-up' increases'' being proposed Currently, federal judges receive the periodic raises given to most federal employees by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' historical reluctance to increase its own pay levels has often meant that cost-of-living increases for other senior government officials have also been denied,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said. Federal judges actually have received cost-of-living increases in most years since 1975. During that period, trial judges' salaries have risen from $ 42,000 to $ 89,500 and appellate court salaries from $ 44,600 to $ 95,000 Last week, five Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> courts subcommittee advised a panel of leading judges that public protests likely would block any judicial pay raise unless non-working senior judges were excluded. The judges opposed such limits. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year reported previously unpublished federal figures showing that in 1987 some 20 percent of the then-306 senior judges did no judicial work, including former Chief Justice <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON>, D-Wis., and Rep. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moorhead </PERSON>, R-Calif., chairman and ranking minority member on the subcommittee, subsequently submitted legislation to bar pay raises other than cost-of-living increases from senior judges who carry less than 25 percent of an active judge's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> said it is believed that the last chief justice who testified before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, whose tenure lasted from 1930 to 1941.

 Soon Cho, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s deputy prime minister and top economic planning officer, said Wednesday that increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure on his country to open its markets and revalue its currency could spark even more instability in his violence-plagued nation. `` The most pressing business for the government of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is to restore order and establish the democratic system,'' said Soon, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for meetings with congressional leaders and top <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials. Soon spoke with reporters as the most recent wave of student unrest claimed the lives of six riot police in <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>, a city about 200 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The victims were set afire during one of the many violent protests that have prompted President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo to threaten the imposition of emergency measures. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said in a statement that the administration deplored `` the senseless violence that has led to this tragic and needless loss of life'' and urged all parties in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to refrain from further violence. On trade matters, the administration has charged <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> with erecting significant trade barriers to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products, part of a process that could result in retaliation against nations refusing to open their doors to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has also been pressuring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to allow its currency to rise in value in relation to the dollar as a way of making its goods more expensive on American markets and making <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods cheaper on South Korean markets. The South Korean official is slated to meet Thursday with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. Those topics were sure to be discussed. Pointing out that his nation has been afflicted with near-daily demonstrations on the part of students, farmers and workers, <PERSON> Soon </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` is pressing <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> very hard to further open its markets, appreciate its currency and so on.'' Arguing that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has already made great strides in attempting to open its markets, Soon said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliation would be interpreted by the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> public as `` too harsh in spite of the great effort that the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government is making. `` I'm sure that it would be adding to instability from which -LRB- the -RRB- <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government is already suffering,'' Soon said. The radical student and dissident protestors are demanding the overthrow of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s government, but have n't had broad public support because of their extremism and violent tactics. They have been able, however, to form alliances with striking workers. Soon argued that the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government `` considers the present level -LRB- of the won, the South Korean currency -RRB- to be a fairly appropriate one'' and sees no reason to revalue it at present. He disupted the contention, made in an initial <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report last October, that his nation has manipulated its currency to gain an unfair competitve advantage in world markets, and he accused the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government of showing `` a lack of understanding on this matter.'' He also faulted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for making `` one-way demands'' on trade matters, saying `` that is not beneficial to the maintainance of good relations.'' Soon stressed, however, that his nation was more than willing to continue the dialogue to prevent inciting a trade war between the two countries and to maintain a cooperative relationship.

<HEAD>Senators Press Hills to Target Japan for Market-Opening Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Senators urged the nation's top trade negotiator on Wednesday to resist pressure to omit <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> from a target list being developed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration in an effort to open key world markets to American exports. `` We would be amazed if <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, with its whole panoply of trade barriers, were not on the list,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., said at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> trade hearing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> told the senators that the administration would `` use the negotiating tools contained in the 1988 act vigorously but constructively to open markets, combat unfair trade practices and persuade our trading partners to honor agreements.'' `` In administering these provisions, we will act as a surgeon using a scalpel to remove these trade barriers and promote a healthier trading system,'' she said. `` We will not use these tools to butcher the rules of the system we are trying to strengthen.'' At issue is a report from <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, due by the end of the month, that must target specific countries for market-opening action and possible retaliation under the so-called Super 301 section of the 1988 trade law. There reportedly is divided opinion within the administration over whether to include <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Under the Super 301 provision, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative targets key countries for market-opening pressure. If they fail to lower their barriers to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> exports within 15 to 19 months, the trade representative takes retaliatory steps, such as tariffs and quotas, to compensate the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The president does have discretion to abort such steps in some cases. The provision is called Super 301 because it represents an extension of section 301 of the Trade Act, which has long been the basic legal authority under which the president is authorized to retaliate against foreign countries for alleged unfair trade practices. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> is due to unveil her list May 30. `` I strongly support the idea and urge you to include <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the Super 301 category,'' Sen. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, told He said that `` their market is not open to us in any way that it should be.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., noted that a long-running dispute between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> over semiconductors remains unresolved `` If that is n't grounds for listing under Super 301 what is?'' <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said. Under questioning from Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said that `` great concern has been expressed by some'' officials of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trading partners as the date for the list approaches and there has been a reaction `` among some others -LRB- of -RRB- more belligerence perhaps. `` There is general anxiety,'' she said. Asked by Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., about reports that foreign lobbying has been heavy at her office as other countries strive to stay off the list, <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> merely said, `` We've had a good number of visitors. She agreed with the view of Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, that merely lowering barriers overseas is far from the answer to the nation's trade problems. `` We could open all the markets we have enumerated and it would not correct our trade deficit, and I think we make a mistake not to tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people that,'' she said. `` To tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people that if you open all these markets that will take care of the trade deficit _ that is not true.''

 A jogger who was beaten on the head with a pipe and a rock and raped in Central Park has emerged from her two-week coma, spoken to relatives and expressed a desire to resume running, doctors said Wednesday. `` I think we have some pretty good news,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>, assistant chief of surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, chief of neurosurgery, said the 28-year-old woman began responding Tuesday and had spoken in a whisper to relatives and staff members, raised two fingers when asked to do so and was able to read large signs printed with yes, no and her name. When a nurse told the patient Tuesday that she would like to resume jogging, the patient replied, `` Me, too,'' <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> said at a news conference. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> said, the woman's brother `` walked into her room and said, ` Can you say hello?' And she said hello. There's definite recognition'' of her relatives Members of the woman's family have maintained a vigil at the hospital since the attack two weeks ago. The woman, an investment banker and a native of a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> suburb, was on her regular jog through Central Park the night of April 19 when a gang of youths pounced on her. Six teen-agers have been indicted on charges of attempted murder, rape, sodomy and assault. By the time she was found, hours later, she had lost three-fourths of her blood and her temperature had fallen to 80 degrees, officials said. `` She has been emerging gradually over the last couple of days or three days,'' <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> said. `` We would still say ... she is in a delirium. People in this stage will fluctuate.'' When hospital staff flashed the signs and she responded, `` three or four people started clapping. I was one of them,'' <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said the patient `` in all medical certainty will not remember the events of her accident'' and probably will not remember things that happened to her for a short period of the time before the attack. <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> has said it is unlikely she will ever fully recover. <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> said she lacks facial expression, but `` manages what appears to be a smile from time to time.'' Meanwhile, a woman jogging during the day time in Central Park was assaulted by three youths Wednesday, and told police one of the youths grabbed her breasts and buttocks, police Detective <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>`Tigress' Thatcher Cuddles Grandson, Defends Record of 10 Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on Wednesday marked the 10th anniversary of her election cuddling her grandson and likening her combative style to a tigress under attack. Interviewed by the domestic <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> agency, the prime minister rejected the charge her style is confrontational, saying: `` Most women defend themselves. It is the female of the species.'' `` It is the tigress and the lioness in you which tends to defend when attacked. That may give the feeling that one is constantly in some kind of battle.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s longest continuously serving prime minister this century also dismissed the latest opinion polls, saying: `` If you just set out to be liked, you would be prepared to compromise on anything at any time and you would achieve nothing.'' Opponents looked back glumly to May 3, 1979, when, after a winter of strikes had left the dead unburied and garbage piled in the streets, Britons voted out the socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Callaghan </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, took office the next day, May 4, becoming <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s first woman prime minister. She since has won two more terms, pursuing a right-wing revolution that has emasculated labor unions and increased prosperity. But critics charge `` Thatcherism'' has made the poor poorer, encouraged greed and divided the nation. `` She has preached the gospel of conflict and division,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hattersley </PERSON>, deputy leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` -LRB- She -RRB- has chosen to govern with an arrogance and autocracy which amounts to an assault on our democratic rights.'' In her interview, the 63-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said: `` Everyone knows now that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> counts for something in the world at large. That is the result of many other achievements.'' Earlier, she posed on the steps of her 10 Downing St. residence cradling her grandson, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>. Her son, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, and his <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> wife, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>, brought the baby from their home in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. `` Is n't he beautiful? Is n't he good?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> cooed as she showed off the sleeping baby, dressed in a blue and white sailor suit. Then she ate lunch at the <ORGANIZATION> Savoy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, where rank-and-file Conservative Party legislators presented her with a silver bowl engraved with the emblems of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Also engraved was a tiny penguin, a reminder of the 1982 war against <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> in which <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> wrested back the disputed <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. The anniversary has triggered a mass of media analyses of Thatcherism, opinion polls about the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> decade, souvenirs and <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> books. These range from weighty biographies to a paperback jokebook. Sample: `` <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> boasts that she is a self-made woman. That certainly relieves the Almighty of a dreadful responsibility.'' On Thursday, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s 21 Cabinet colleagues, all male and including only three survivors of her first Cabinet, will host a dinner in her honor at 10 Downing Street. To beat all records for length of service, she would have to overtake <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>'s 1812-27 tenure. `` I think you might say, well within reach,'' a Thatcher aide said sardonically Wednesday. Whether they like it or not, many Britons agree. A Harris poll in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s liberal Observer newspaper showed 58 percent of those questioned want Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to step down within a couple of years, but only 7 percent believe she actually will. A Gallup poll showed 67 percent of respondents dislike Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> personally, about the same as the 63 percent who said they respect her.

 The countdown marched smoothly Wednesday toward a second attempt to launch the shuttle Atlantis with a crew of five and a space probe destined for <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s only worry was a worsening weather forecast `` All in all, things look good for a 1:48 p.m. launch tomorrow -LRB- Thursday -RRB- and the start of our trip to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>,'' launch test director <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofge </PERSON> said of shuttle preparations. The weather outlook, however, was not the greatest, with forecasters saying Wednesday afternoon there was a 40 percent chance that either rain or high winds would prevent a launch during the available 64-minute launch period. That was up from 30 percent in the morning and 20 percent two days ago. The first launch attempt last Friday was aborted just 31 seconds before the planned liftoff because of a short circuit in a fuel pump. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said the delay cost about $ 300,000. The mission to take the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft into orbit will revive a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planetary program that has been dormant since the launch of <LOCATION> Pioneer-Venus </LOCATION> in 1978. `` After an 11-year gap in the planetary program, we're anxious to get started,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerpheide </PERSON>, project manager for <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>. Shuttle chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON> opened an afternoon news conference with, `` Here we are again, and we're ready to fly again. We've fixed our problems `` The weather is not going to be as good as it was last Friday, but it appears it will be good.'' Air Force Capt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Strange </PERSON>, the shuttle meteorologist, said `` there is a 40 percent chance of a violation of weather constraints.'' He said the forecast called for a chance of rain showers. But of more concern, he said, was the possibility of crosswinds of more than 14 mph that could be dangerous if the shuttle had to make an emergency landing on a runway near the launch pad. On Thursday, the shuttle must be launched by 2:52 p.m., the end of a 64-minute `` launch window,'' in order to have <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> in the right position for a flight to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. If it is n't launched by May 28, <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> will have to wait for two years before <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> are in the right position again. Technicians working around the clock replaced the fuel pump and a suspect fuel line in half the time expected, enabling <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to reschedule the launch for Thursday, at least a day earlier than officials thought was possible. Engineers had thought there was a leak in the fuel line that was replaced, but tests turned up nothing. They believe a vapor cloud seen spewing from the line, thought at first to be gas, was trapped water vapor. <PERSON> Sofge </PERSON> reported both new parts had been checked and certified for flight and that the engine compartment had been closed up. The launch team prepared to pump 528,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into Atlantis' external fuel tank early Thursday. The five astronauts reviewed flight plans and honed their flying efficiency over central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in T-38 jet planes. `` This time we're going to see if we can get it right,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who will command the mission. `` We're extremely pleased the folks here at the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> were able to do such a good and quick job getting it ready to go again.'' The other crew members are pilot <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabe </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleave </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Thagard </PERSON>. Cleave and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> are to deploy <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> from the shuttle's cargo hold six hours after launch. An hour later a rocket will ignite to propel it on its 15-month journey to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> has a radar system powerful enough to pierce the dense sulfuric acid clouds shrouding <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and map its surface. The mission costs $ 550 million, not including the $ 225 million cost of the four-day shuttle flight. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>'s radar images should reveal details as small as 100 yards across, about the size of a football field. This is 10 times sharper than previous pictures of the planet captured by two Soviet craft in 1983.

 A man was trapped for 20 minutes when his car was submerged on a flooded street during heavy rain, but he was rescued by an off-duty police officer who dove in and swam to the car. `` He's the nicest cop I ever met,'' said <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, 71, of <LOCATION> Elmont </LOCATION>, at a hospital where he was treated for exposure. `` It's all part of my job,'' said <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Police Officer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s car stalled Tuesday in water accumulating under a parkway overpass during a heavy rain storm. `` I knew it was raining like the dickens but I did n't know the water was that deep,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said later Tuesday. He said he had stopped his car at the edge of the water but a motorist behind him pushed him into the center of the rising pool, where his engine stalled. The motorist who pushed him and several other cars turned around and left. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> could n't open his car doors because of the water, which was up to the top of the steering wheel and rising quickly. And with the engine off he could n't open his electric windows. `` I just sat there and waited,'' said <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, 28, was on his way home from the overnight shift when he saw two cars under water. Still wearing his uniform, the 6-foot-2 officer jumped into the approximately six feet of water and swam about 50 feet to the cars. There was no one in the first car he checked, but he spotted <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> in his car, tugged the driver's door open, grabbed <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> and carried him to safety. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> had spent about 20 minutes in the water. `` I'm not going to take any more baths like that one,'' he said.

<HEAD>Arafat Says PLO Charter Superseded by November Declarations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> charter calling for the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has been superseded by a declaration urging peaceful coexistence of the Jewish state and a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief, ending a two-day visit to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, did not suggest any formal action to reword or scrap the hard-line language in the 25-year-old charter, and his statement elicited cynical responses from right-wing Israeli leaders. But French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and other government leaders said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statements were a step toward clearing up the contradiction between the charter and more recent <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> statements recognizing the existence of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renouncing terrorism. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told a French radio interviewer he considers the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> charter to have been superseded by the Palestinian declaration of independence passed in November. The declaration urged the peaceful coexistence of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Aides to <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> leaders repeatedly urged <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to push for changes in the charter. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief Tuesday described the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> charter as `` caduc,'' which in French means outdated or null and void. A radio interview Wednesday urged him to clarify the statement, and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> responded that the appropriate word in English would be `` superseded.'' When asked why he did n't use the word `` abrogated,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> responded: `` It is not up to me to say that. It is a decision that must come from the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statement, `` If it is backed by words and deeds, is a step in the right direction.'' She urged formal action by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile, to abrogate or amend the charter. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, one of the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions, said he was `` horrified'' by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s comments regarding the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> charter. `` We shall show <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and the world that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> charter remains very well alive,'' <PERSON> Habash </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has no right to take such decisions.'' <PERSON> Ovadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, called <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statement a `` rhetorical juggling. `` The security of the region and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should not depend on the media stunts of a terrorist like <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Sofer </PERSON> said. But French Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, who met Wednesday with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, said his comments constitute `` a positive clarification moving toward peace.'' Government spokesman <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pensec </PERSON>, briefing reporters on Wednesday's regular Cabinet meeting, said <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> told his ministers he also `` noted that we are seeing a beginning of this clarification'' of the discrepancy between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> charter and the November declaration. Also Wednesday, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> went to Pere Lachaise cemetery in eastern <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to pay his respects to <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamchari </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representative in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> who died during a bomb explosion in his apartment in 1973. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamchari </PERSON>'s widow and daughter stood beside <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> while he placed a wreath inscribed `` Glory to the Palestinian martyrs'' on the grave.

<HEAD>Fed Reports Economy Growing at ``Moderate, Sustainable Pace''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The economy `` grew at a moderate, sustainable pace'' in the past three months, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday in a report which analysts took as a sign that the central bank will not be pushing interest rates higher. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s review of economic conditions around the country painted a picture of an economy where the growth rate is slowing with inflationary pressures easing. The central bank for the past year has been trying to engineer just such a development, by pushing interest rates up to dampen demand and thus relieve pressures on tight labor markets and factories operating at peak capacity. The tone of this report was more optimistic than the last economic survey released two months ago when the central bank expressed fears about pressures on wages and prices as a result of the pace of economic growth. The new report, based on surveys conducted by the 12 regional <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks, said there were no serious bottlenecks in the manufacturing sector and the costs of raw materials and labor had shown no significant increases. `` The nation's economy grew at a moderate, sustainable pace in February, March and early April,'' the central bank said in the new report. By using the word `` sustainable,'' analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was expressing its satisfaction with the current pace of economic growth and indicating that it did not see the need to push interest rates higher. `` This is a very optimistic review,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an economic consulting firm. `` It says that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is happy with the way the economy has moderated with growth slowing to a sustainable level.'' The economic survey will be used when <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy-makers meet on May 16 to decide on the course for future monetary strategy. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s main job is to keep inflation under control through decisions on how much money to make available to the banking system. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been in a holding pattern in recent months after a period of aggressively pushing interest rates higher in late December and January. Analysts said they believe interest rates will stay where they are currently for the next couple of months as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> assesses the impact of its earlier actions. But <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said he expected rates to start falling by early summer as the slowdown in the economy becomes more pronounced. While some economists have expressed fears that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has overdone its tightening efforts and will push the country into a recession later this year, the economic review saw no evidence of a dangerous slowdown in any sector of the economy. Consumer spending, manufacturing, construction and agriculture were all reported to be performing adequately. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that the non-farm economy grew at an annual rate of 3 percent in the first three months of the year, down slightly from a non-farm growth rate of 3.5 percent in the final three months of 1988. Many analysts believe economic growth will slow even further in coming quarters as the effect of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s year-long credit tightening works its way through the economy.

<HEAD>Hospital Association: Health Care Threatened by Worker Shortage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A shortage of health-care workers, such as physical and occupational therapists, is threatening the availability of hospital care, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> survey said Wednesday. In its survey of 3,001 hospitals, the association found that despite adding overtime, changing compensation programs, setting up on-call staff pools and using contract services, one-fourth of the hospitals said they were forced to cut services. Of the hospitals that cut services, more than 15 percent closed beds or units and almost 13 percent sent patients to other hospitals because they lacked sufficient staff. `` Hospital and patients already feel the effects of personnel shortages,'' said association President <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>. `` If left unchecked, these shortages can threaten our ability to respond to the health-care needs of all Americans.'' The survey found that of 20 personnel categories, hospitals were having the most difficulty recruiting full-time physical therapists, clinical perfusionists _ operators of machines that support or temporarily replace circulatory or respiratory functions _ and occupational therapists. Also in short supply were speech pathologists and respiratory therapists, pharmacists and certified registered-nurse anesthetists. Positions for physical and occupational therapists have a 15 percent to 16 percent vacancy rate. To address the labor shortages, Ms. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said she believed the industry must create, preserve and expand educational opportunities for people interested in pursuing health-care careers. Hospitals also must develop innovative staffing options that lead to greater staff productivity and retention, she said. The survey, conducted from July through December 1988, found that vacancy rates varied according to regions, but physical and occupational therapists are in short supply throughout the country.

 Immigration authorities credited the Mexican government Wednesday with helping stem a flood of Central American refugees illegally trying to cross the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border into <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>, deputy immigration commissioner, said <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> authorities have arrested some 13,000 Central Americans trying to enter <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> from the south in the past six months, up from 12,000 in the previous year. The latest arrests occurred after <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> tightened security along its own southern border and began random highway checks of motorists driving north through the country toward <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s stepped-up enforcement, combined with tighter border security imposed in February by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities in south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, has significantly reduced the flow of illegal aliens, <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> said. An <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> task force set up Feb. 21 to stem a flow of illegal aliens seeking political asylum has reported a sharp drop in border arrests since then, <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> said. The task force arrested 54 people on Tuesday, down from the 200 to 300 daily in February, <ORGANIZATION> Buck </ORGANIZATION> said. The task force now gets only a handful of asylum applications each day, <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> said. In February it was receiving as many as 200 a day. Following a court battle, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> won the right to detain people seeking asylum while their applications were pending. Most of the applicants for asylum were rejected because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials ruled they could not demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution at home. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials say most are fleeing poverty and seeking better opportunities in this country and are therefore not political refugees. As many as 2,500 were detained at the INS facility in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isabel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where 1,500 people are currently being held. About 1,700 have been deported. The complement of 400 <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and immigration personnel who were sent to the <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, area is costing the government $ 4 million to $ 5 million a month, <ORGANIZATION> Buck </ORGANIZATION> said. If current trends continue, `` probably by the end of the summer, we will begin to see this entire task force sized down significantly,'' Buck said.

 Longtime political and civil rights figure <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> lost his bid for a fifth term as mayor of <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION> in the Democratic primary, but <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> says he wo n't miss being the center of attention. `` I'm happy to be out of the race and out of the limelight,'' the 66-year-old <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> said after losing Tuesday 390-248 to attorney and longtime foe <PERSON> Kennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON>. `` It was time for a change,'' added <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, who says he'll now concentrate on helping youth in <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, located in southwest <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and among the most impoverished areas of the nation's poorest state. <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON>, 39, a <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION> native, faces independent candidate <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> in the June 6 general election. The always outspoken and often controversial <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> lost to <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> eight years ago and trailed in the balloting against <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> four years ago. In 1985, however, he won back the town's top spot for another four-year term through legal challenges that eventually were settled by the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Evers first was elected mayor in 1969. `` In 1985 he ran a very negative campaign and a campaign of lies that there were going to be quick solutions to the problems in <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> had done little over the years tobring about positive change in <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION>, a town of just over 2,000 located about 25 miles northeast of the historic <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Natchez </LOCATION>. Nearly 20 percent of <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION> residents, about 90 percent of whom are black, were without jobs in March, the last month for which figures are available. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> had a March unemployment rate of 8.6 percent and the national rate was 5.2 percent. `` I think that for all of his visibility and name recognition, there's one basic element missing,'' <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> said. `` Those things do not make him a good administrator, a good mayor. He has celebrity status, but that does not necessarily equate with the ability to run a city.'' <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> says while he was a candidate, he did n't bother to campaign because he `` could feel the people wanted a change.'' `` But I did n't want to quit. I wanted the people to select change.'' <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> lost a 1978 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bid and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1971. He was defeated in a March 14 special election for the state's central district highway commissioner post. Evers is the brother of <PERSON> Medgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, who was field director of the state <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> when he was gunned down by a sniper in 1963. He raised the ire of some civil rights leaders when, on June 22, 1988, he gave a humanitarian award named for his brother to Angolan rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>. `` I'm tired. Twenty years is enough,'' <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> said. `` I'm tired of being out front. Let someone else be out front.'' As for the future, <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> says he will continue living in <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION> and will be supportive of the new adminstration. `` I will continue to travel, to promote, to have fun and live,'' he said. `` I will keep busy.''

<HEAD>Study Says Potassium May Help Lower Blood Pressure</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For Release at 6 p.m. EDT</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New experimental data support the suspicion that getting enough potassium in the diet may play a key part in keeping blood pressure under control. The research suggests that when people do not get enough potassium in their diet, their bodies fail to get rid of enough salt, which makes their blood pressure go up. Epidemiological studies that look at large groups of people have found an association between low potassium intake and high blood pressure. But experts were uncertain whether the potassium or some other nutritional deficiency was responsible. In the latest study, doctors compared the blood pressures of 10 healthy people on very low-potassium diets and on diets with normal amounts of the nutrient. `` When these people ate diets low in potassium, their blood pressures went up. One of the main reasons seems to be related to sodium excretion. When not eating enough potassium, they could not get rid of enough sodium,'' said Dr. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gopal </PERSON> <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON>, who directed the study at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> said more research will be needed before making new recommendations about what people should eat to hold down their blood pressures. `` From this study, I ca n't draw long-term implications,'' he said. `` But when you put two and two together with the epidemiological studies, it suggests that low potassium intake might be one of the causes of hypertension.'' The study was published in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. During 10 days on the low-sodium diets, the volunteers' blood pressures rose from a mean of 119 over 77 to 126 over 81. Most fruits and vegetables are good sources of potassium. Among some of the best are bananas, starwberries, potatoes and orange and grapefruit juice. Studies have shown that potassium consumption is especially low among blacks, who are also at greater than usual risk of high blood pressure.

 <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> woman who captured attention with a letter-writing campaign to advertisers on a network show she found offensive, on Wednesday announced a campaign to put more family programs on prime-time television. `` Our emphasis ... will be to promote private, voluntary efforts by the advertisers and the networks to raise the standards on network television,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON> said of her new organization, Americans for Responsible Television. She said the group's first goal would be the renewal of family viewing time, which she described as at least two hours of nightly prime-time entertainment suitable for children and adults. `` I have n't met anyone who said they want more sex or violence on TV,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON> told a news conference. `` The violence today is so good technically that you're almost a participant in it.'' She said her fight against programs she views as inappropriate for children began last year, when her 8-year-old daughter became upset after watching an afternoon talk show that dealt with women who had sex with dogs. But the `` straw that broke the camel's back'' was a segment of <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Married ... With Children. She lobbied the advertisers with a letter-writing campaign to complain about sexual innuendo and the treatment of women in the popular comedy about a blue-collar family. The advertisers later pulled their commercials from the show, with <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tambrands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> telling their advertising agencies not to buy time on the show. In March, two advertisers _ <ORGANIZATION> Ralston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ canceled plans to run commercials on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Saturday Night Live'' after complaints from the Rev. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tupelo </ORGANIZATION>, Miss. The Christian group has campaigned for more than a decade against what <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> sees as pornography and excessive violence in magazines, on television and in the movies. Mrs. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON> told reporters that `` First Amendment rights extend beyond simply turning off the television or turning the channel. `` They include the right to voice our objections to the advertisers about the sex and violence being dumped into our homes every night.'' She said she planned to mail letters to 5,000 potential supporters for her group to ask that they ask advertisers not to sponsor shows the letter writers consider objectionable. `` A boycott -LRB- of products -RRB- is always a tool; it's a tool of last resort,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON> said. `` Networks and sponsors can work it out.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON> said that, `` when the set is on, children are usually being exposed to programming that is inappropriate and potentially harmful.'' The publicity around Mrs. <PERSON> Rakolta </PERSON>'s attacks against the Fox show netted 832 letters, most in sympathy, to her <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home. She said she hoped to use those supporters as the base for her group.

 <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, the media master of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidential campaign, wants it known that he did not _ repeat, not _ make any commercials featuring <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> convict <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>. `` At no time did any commercial for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> contain a picture of <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> or use his name,'' <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> said in letters sent to news organizations, including The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. But was n't it the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign that made <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison furlough program an indelible part of voters' perceptions of Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Indeed it was. And the <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> controversy lives on, most recently in an article written for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> and entitled, `` <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> and Me.'' The <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> commercials were also at the center of successful efforts by students at predominantly black <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to force former <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, now <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, to resign from the school's board of trustees. <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> has been trying to walk away from <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> for some time. At first, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign was concerned that the <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> ads would create a political backlash among voters who perceived the ads as racist. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, who is black, escaped in 1986 while on his 10th furlough from a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison, where he was serving life without parole for a 1974 murder. He surfaced in 1987 in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, where he assaulted a couple and raped the woman. More recently, <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> is described by associates as tired of being identified incorrectly as the creator of the <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> commercials. The two commercials that featured <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> were produced and aired by an independent expenditure committee called Americans for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, not the official <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign committee. As <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> pointed out in his letter, `` federal law prohibits any collaboration between a political action committee and a legal campaign committee during the course of a campaign.'' This is not to say that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> never raised the <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> issue. Before those ads were aired, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recounted the <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> case in great detail. In his speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it was `` a scandal to give a weekend furlough to a hardened first-degree killer who has n't even served enough time to be eligible for parole.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign did run commercials criticizing the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison furlough program. But they never mentioned <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> by name. One was the `` Crime Quiz'' ad. The announcer asked, `` Which candidate for president gave weekend passes to first-degree murderers who are not even eligible for parole?'' An unflattering picture of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> moved forward on the screen. Another <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commercial showed shadowy figures moving through a revolving gate while the announcer said, `` His revolving door prison policy gave weekend furloughs to first-degree murderers not eligible for parole. While out, many committed other crimes like kidnapping and rape, and many are still at large.'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, attacked the <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> commercials as racist. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said using the <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> case `` is designed to create the most horrible psycho-sexual fears.'' `` Grossly unfair and untrue,'' retorted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when asked about the allegations his campaign was using racist tactics. <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> wrote that while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his aides may not have paid for the television ads showing <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>'s picture and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> side by side -LRB- Americans for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did -RRB-, `` they took great pride in having found and framed the issue.'' Late in the campaign, <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> was interviewed on the <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> and said that when he first saw the <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> commercial `` I called headquarters and said whoever's doing that, get them to stop it. And the campaign legal counsel said we ca n't stop it. We have had conversations, we've sent letters, we ca n't stop it.'' <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baran </PERSON>, who was general counsel to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, said he knew of no specific appeal to Americans for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to stop running the <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> commercials. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides did complain that the group's name and fund-raising tactics gave the incorrect impression that it was an official arm of the campaign. On Sept. 8, the day after the two <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> commercials began a run on national cable networks that was slated to continue until Oct. 5, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Fediay </PERSON>, head of Americans for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said she was sending a letter to campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> asking him to express `` your wishes with regard to independent public advocacy of Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for president.'' She said, `` If he asks me to stop advocating the election of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, I will.'' In a letter dated Sept. 27 _ after the <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> commercials had run for nearly three weeks _ <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> wrote to Ms. <PERSON> Fediay </PERSON> asking that `` you cease using his name, the name ` Americans for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,' and any other name that suggests his or this campaign's association with you.'' By then, there were few voters left in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> who were n't familiar with the saga of <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>

<HEAD>Battleship Turret Repair Estimate: $15 Million to $20 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> believes it can repair the damaged gun turret on the battleship <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> for around $ 15 million to $ 20 million, with the lower figure more likely, defense sources said Wednesday. The sources, speaking one day after <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials announced it was technically feasible to repair the turret after last month's fatal explosion, stressed the dollar estimate was preliminary and that no decision had been made to authorize the work An assessment team has provided the preliminary estimate but the investigation is continuing, said one defense official who commented only on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> declined comment on the issue Wednesday. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, said Tuesday a 35-member team of specialists had determined that materials and expertise were available to make repairs. The answer to that basic question had not been clear in the immediate aftermath of the April 19 explosion because of the vessel's age. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was commissioned in 1943 during World War II and no vessel of its type has been built since that war. Forty-seven sailors died in the explosion inside the No. 2 gun turret. The fact that repairs are technically feasible does not mean the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has decided to go ahead, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. But one defense official said a final repair estimate of $ 15 million would make it easier for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to make that decision. Some private naval experts, because of the severity of the explosion, had predicted last week repairs could cost as much as $ 100 million. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s skipper, Capt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>, has said the vessel would be ready for battle even if the damaged turret was never repaired. The huge battleship still has two other turrets, each with three 16-inch guns.

 As mourners crowded into a tiny rural church to pay their last respects Wednesday to the minister and three members of his family found shot to death, investigators continued their search for clues. About 250 mourners filed into the <ORGANIZATION> Olive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brethren </ORGANIZATION> in Christ for the memorial service for the Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>, 38; his wife, <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON>, 32; and daughters, <PERSON> Janel </PERSON>, 8, and <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON>, 6. The Pelleys were shot Saturday in their home across the gravel parking lot from the church. Their bodies were discovered Sunday morning by a church trustee. The Pelleys' three surviving children also attended the memorial service. In the eulogy, the Rev. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, a regional superintendent of the church, read from the Bible's book of Isaiah: `` The righteous are taken away to be spared from evil.'' `` Though his ministry at Olive Branch was a short one _ two and a half years to be exact _ it was a very successful one,'' Price said. `` We, like all who know the <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON> family, are going to miss them greatly.'' <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a bishop of the church, said the family had served <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> in a team ministry. `` They are now in the actual presence of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. Is n't that tremendous?'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. The mourners sang `` Amazing Grace,'' which was Mrs. <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>'s favorite hymn, and `` What A Friend We Have In <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>,'' then filed quietly from the church Hours before the service, police divers resumed their search for a weapon in farm ponds near the parsonage, while a sheriff's horse patrol searched wooded areas nearby for evidence. `` I do n't feel we're any closer'' to an arrest, said <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>. Investigators ruled out robbery or burglary as motives because the home showed no sign of forced entry. The absence of a weapon ruled out murder-suicide. A coroner said each victim was shot once in the head at close range with a shotgun. Police released no further details on the autopsies. The <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>'s three other children were not home when the attack occurred police said. <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>, 10, had stayed overnight with friends, and <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>, 14, was attending church camp. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>, 17, told investigators he spent Saturday involved with high school prom activities and then traveled with friends to an amusement park north of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> following an all-night prom party. Homicide investigators have questioned <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>, but have refused to say whether he is a suspect. The Pelleys married almost four years ago, after their first spouses died, congregation members said. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> were <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>'s children from his first marriage. <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>, 10, <PERSON> Janel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON> were the children from Ms. <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>'s first marriage.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who led a dramatic but unsuccessful fight against the free trade agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, announced Wednesday he is stepping down as leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Liberals lost twice to Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> since <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> took over the leadership in 1984 The most recent defeat was in November 1988. `` It is my intention to resign as leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> at an appropriate time, after the national executive has chosen a date for a leadership convention,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said in a letter released at an <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> news conference. `` I do feel regret that I was not able to accomplish the ultimate goal of a politician: To win an election and become prime minister,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, 59, inherited the prime minister's job in 1984 after <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> resigned, but <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s term lasted only 79 days. He and the Liberals were ousted by <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and the Conservatives in an election that left barely 40 Liberals in the Commons. Much of his era as Liberal leader was marked by fierce internal battles within the party, which dominated Canadian politics for much of the 20th century. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a lawyer, revived his own and his party's sagging fortunes with a persistent, emotional campaign against the free trade agreement that <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> signed with former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in January 1988. The agreement will eliminate trade barriers between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> over a 10-year period. `` This is the fight of my life. I've never been more serious about any cause in my life,'' he said of his effort to halt the agreement during the fall election campaign. The high point of the campaign came during a televised debate with <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> of the third-place <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in which Turner accused the prime minister of placing <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s sovereignty at risk by signing the agreement. `` You sold us out,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said, almost instantly soaring in the opinion polls and attracting fervent crowds to his once nearly deserted rallies. But <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> went on to win a second consecutive majority government, clinching the way for the pact to take effect Jan. 1. Turner gained credit for doubling the party's seats to 83 in the 295-seat House of Commons. The New Democrats also are in a leadership race after <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> announced in March his retirement after 14 years at the socialist party's helm. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, speaking to reporters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> during a three-day visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, called <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> `` a very worthy opponent'' who `` gave as good as he got.'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said he expected to remain a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for `` the immediate future.'' He said he had no job lined up in the private sector. A Liberal Party convention is set for October in <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, but the party executive can decide to defer a leadership convention and turn the gathering into a policy conference.

 Southern Sudanese rebels have kidnapped a Roman Catholic priest from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and are holding him in the war-torn south or neighboring <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> diplomat said Wednesday. French Embassy spokesman <PERSON> Jean-Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Eyguiser </PERSON> identified the priest only as the Rev. <PERSON> le </PERSON> <PERSON> Vacher </PERSON> and said he was kidnapped from <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION>, a southern Sudanese town that fell Feb. 26 to rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Eyguiser </PERSON> refused to say when it is thought the priest was abducted. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the White Fathers confirmed that a Rev. <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> le </PERSON> <PERSON> Vacher </PERSON>, 62, has been assigned to <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION> since May 1987. But the Rev. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Nouaille </PERSON> said the order has not heard of any kidnapping. He said he last heard of le <PERSON> Vacher </PERSON> on March 17, when a colleague returning from <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION> told him the priest was in good health. `` Had there been any question of a kidnapping at the time, we would have known,'' he said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Nouaille </PERSON> did not dismiss the possibility le <PERSON> Vacher </PERSON> was kidnapped later. He said the priest, born in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> town of Giens, `` insisted on staying on in <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION> despite the fighting.'' Rebels in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> took up arms against the government in 1983, demanding autonomy and more economic development from the <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> government, which is dominated by the majority Moslems. Most southerners are a minority of Christians and animists. Rebels have kidnapped more than 20 foreign missionaries and development workers over the years. In 1983, Sudanese commandos twice stormed rebel camps to free foreign hostages, some held under death threats against demands for money. Kidnappings since then appear to be publicity ploys, though rebels claim they abduct victims for their own protection. Those held are freed after varying lengths of time. This week, rebel leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> announced a one-month cease-fire to allow the government to work on a peace plan, and to facilitate a massive <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> relief effort to save 100,000 southerners threatened by war-induced famine.

 A grand jury heard testimony Wednesday from relatives of a man accused of murdering his 16-month-old son, comatose since last summer, by unhooking his hospital life-support system. The wife, mother and brother of <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, 23, of suburban <PERSON> Cicero </PERSON>, testified behind closed doors before the panel, which can decide if <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> should be indicted in the death of his son, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>, who was buried Monday. <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> held hands with his wife, <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON>, as they and other relatives entered the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> building. `` They're in deep grieving over this,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an assistant public defender representing <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>. `` This has been a nine-month ordeal for them and it's been exacerbated by the fact that their grieving has been done in public. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> ca n't just go off by themselves and grieve,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The boy suffered brain damage after choking on a balloon or small piece of aluminum foil last summer, officials have said. Authorities said <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> held Rush-Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> workers at bay with a gun early on April 26 and unhooked the ventilator that kept <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> alive for eight According to police, <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> tearfully held <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> until he died, saying later he did it `` because I loved my son.'' <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, charged with first-degree murder, was not subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury. He waited in his attorneys' office while Mrs. <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, his brother, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, and his mother, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, went to testify, his lawyers said. The family members all left the building later Wednesday without talking to reporters. `` We encourage <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON>'s wife, mother and brother to fully cooperate in the sure belief that the grand jury will refuse to indict,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. If the grand jury chooses not to return an indictment, the case would likely go to a Criminal Court judge, whose options would include dropping the existing charge. <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, accompanied by her lawyer, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyne </PERSON>, was in the grand jury room for about 25 minutes. <PERSON> Coyne </PERSON> said later that she did not invoke a 5th Amendment right to avoid testifying, but he would not disclose what she said. `` I'm convinced she's not a target'' of the investigation, he added The couple have two other children, a boy and a girl under age 5.

 The town of <LOCATION> Rantoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, is the first to receive a federal planning grant from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to help cope with the upcoming round of military base closings, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The community, located next to the <ORGANIZATION> Chanute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, will receive $ 73,045 `` to help organize a base reuse committee to start planning the civilian conversion of the base property,'' according to a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> statement. In addition to the federal money, <LOCATION> Rantoul </LOCATION> is contributing money and services worth $ 11,300 and the state of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> $ 10,000 to support the effort. `` The reuse committee will oversee development of a balanced plan for the property covering such uses as aviation, industrial development, housing, education, recreation and possibly health-related activities,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> statement said. The grant was made by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adjustment </ORGANIZATION>, which has helped more than 400 communities since 1961 deal with the closure of nearby military facilities. The grant to <LOCATION> Rantoul </LOCATION>, however, is the first since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved a long list of base closings last month under a special procedure set up last year. <ORGANIZATION> Chanute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> is one of 86 bases now set for closure under the program, which was prompted primarily by budget concerns. Savings from the plan, which also includes substantial changes at 54 other facilities, are estimated at $ 694 million a year at first. Savings over 20 years are estimated at $ 5.6 billion. The Pentagon has estimated that 15 to 20 communities will apply for grants similar to that given <LOCATION> Rantoul </LOCATION>. Besides planning grants, the Pentagon office also is authorized to help with the construction or hardware costs of converting bases to other uses. The department has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2 million in fiscal 1990 for economic adjustment work.

 College-bound students worn out by the college application process have let off a little steam by burning college catalogs and rejection letters. `` I'm going to savor this,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Pescatello </PERSON>, 18, who was about to throw her rejection letters from <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> into the blaze. `` We've been under a lot of pressure and I'm going to have fun doing this.'' <PERSON> Pescatello </PERSON> was joined by about 100 other seniors and parents who participated in the Tuesday evening bonfire dubbed `` Senior Burn Out.'' `` It's over.

 Senators said Wednesday that if <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> pushes for removing short-range nuclear missiles from its soil, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might reconsider its commitment to having many troops stationed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> they had serious concerns about West German positions favoring a delay in modernization of the weapons and urging U.S.-Soviet negotiations to scale back the short-range rockets. The West German stand and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's support for tripling the range of the U.S.-built Lance missiles has created a major dispute within the 16-member <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. `` I think if the West German people have come to the conclusion they can place more faith and reliance on -LRB- Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s words and assurances than they can upon sound <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategy, then it would be very difficult for me to continue to commit the size of the forces we have in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> under those circumstances,'' said Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON>, R-Wash., said that if the missiles are eliminated and the 324,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces are put at risk, the administration's policy should be `` that a substantial percentage of troops be brought home and we allow <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> greater responsibility of their defense. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to discuss the fiscal 1990 defense budget, cautioned against `` overdramatizing the nature of the current differences'' within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> speculated that if a consensus called for a zero level for the short-range missiles, `` I as secretary of defense would have something of a stomach ache if we found ourself in the position where in fact large numbers of our <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies encouraged us to maintain our conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but take out all our nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not considered that possibility but if it did occur, there would be a `` major dust-up in the alliance.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> wants the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to negotiate with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on reductions in the short-range missiles. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> have rejected such negotiations. Alliance members are hoping to reach some internal consensus prior to the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> May 29-30. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the committee chairman, expressed concerns that `` <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> appears to be shooting itself in the foot ... everyday'' by focusing on such a narrow issue, and faulted both sides in the dispute for failing to show any vision `` I do n't see any strategy on the part of the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government where they're basically saying they wo n't modernize but they want to negotiate,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> told <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. `` I do n't see much strategy coming out of the other side's position which says we insist on modernizing and building a weapon that you will not accept but we wo n't negotiate even if the Soviets make tremendous unequal positions.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance is letting slip an opportunity to negotiate reductions in conventional forces. The chairman suggested a three-track approach linking modernization of the short-range missile, reductions of the weapons and cuts in conventional strength. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the debate within the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance is `` a very difficult and delicate area,'' although he termed the West German position `` a weak one because it focuses solely on negotiation.'' During his appearance before the panel, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> also played down the apparent disparity between his pessimistic assessment of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s chances of implementing reforms and the view held by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The president and I were in a meeting yesterday and frankly chuckled at what has developed by way of press commentary on views that we have expressed. We do not perceive a significant difference in terms of our views of the situation with respect to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. The defense secretary created a stir last week by speculating <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may fail to institute reforms and could be replaced by a hardliner. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> offered more hopeful assessments of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s liberalization efforts, although they did not publicly rebuke <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said Wednesday that he `` responded previously the other day perhaps with more candor than was warranted about my view ... somewhat pessimistic concerning Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s prospect for achieving his reforms.'' `` The president has expressed the hope those reforms will be successful. We do n't see those ... as contradictory statements,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. On other matters, <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>: _ Said a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> review panel would determine if testing of `` Brilliant Pebbles,'' a more advanced Star Wars system consisting of thousands of orbiting satellites, would violate the broad interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty `` I'm certainly not about to embark on an activity breaching that treaty,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said _ Defended his decision to eliminate the V-22 Osprey despite complaints from Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, that $ 2 billion and nine years of work have been invested in the ship-to-shore aircraft <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> found some way to put money back in the budget, he would not object to bringing the program back.

 A private human rights group said Wednesday that conditions for next Sunday's elections in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` fall far short'' of minimum standards for a fair process, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government continued its campaign of daily attacks as well. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> accused Panamanian authorities of adopting an `` increasingly threatening tone'' as the election approaches. A report issued by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> group </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government has taken a number of steps to prevent an honest election, including the forcing of prominent opposition leaders into exile. It also said that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> is dominated by pro-government representatives whose response to opposition complaints has failed `` to inspire confidence in its impartiality.'' The report said that the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government has demonstrated both before and during the election campaign a willingness to disregard the individual rights of its citizens. It noted that other human rights groups have alleged cases of prolonged detention without charge, of torture and even of murder of goverment critics. `` All of the evidence gathered by the <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in its study of this election points unequivocally to the conclusion that the conditions for the election fall far short of the minimum standards required for a free and fair electoral exercise,'' the report said. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the government news media are undertaking a `` campaign of intimidation'' aimed at reducing voter turnout and discouraging popular protest once the victory of the government's candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, is announced She noted that the government has warned that any media reporting results other than those released by the government will be punished by warnings, fines and possibly closure.

<HEAD>Woman Claims Bluegrass Star Hit Her With Bible</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A woman says she was trying to end a romantic relationship with 77-year-old bluegrass music star <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> when he beat her with a Bible. <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Huff </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said she was trying to get <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> to swear on the Bible that he was not seeing other women when he grabbed the book and hit her with it at this farm near here. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON>, who was not seriously hurt in the incident Monday, filed assault charges the same day against the Grand Ole Opry star. A preliminary hearing is scheduled May 10. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> was arrested Tuesday and freed on $ 500 bond. He did not return a telephone message left Wednesday by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at his <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON>, who said she is the divorced mother of two, described herself as <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>'s girlfriend for 3 -LCB- years. `` I was leaving him, and I wanted my things back,'' she said in a copyright story Wednesday in the <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Banner </LOCATION>. `` That's when he just started tearing things up,'' she said. `` I told him to stop, and I asked him if we could n't just end this thing on a very peaceful note.'' `` Things kept on, and finally I said, ` Bill, if you have n't been running around with these women, here's the Bible ...' `` I said, ` Swear on it to me that you have not been running around, because that way you'll tell me for real.' `` He said, ` I'm not going to do it.' That's when he took the Bible and _ swack _ right in the mouth. It was a big ol' Bible.'' <PERSON> Huff </PERSON>, a dog trainer, said she pushed him away. `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> takes nitroglycerin for his heart, and all I need is for the old man to drop dead on me and I'd be in trouble.'' She said he also slapped her head, broke her glasses, and kicked her. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> said <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>'s farm manager, <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, came in the house and helped her escape. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Buddy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attractions </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> booking agency for <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, quoted the performer as saying <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> came to his house, started destroying property and caused a major disturbance. `` He asked her to leave several times and she refused to leave,'' <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> called the police, the police came to the house, took statements from both parties, and I guess she filed charges against him. `` He did state that he's totally shocked and that he's never been arrested for anything in his life.'' <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> said he did not ask the performer whether he struck the woman. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, a singer and mandolin player, has played with his band, the <ORGANIZATION> Bluegrass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION>, on the Opry since 1939. `` Blue Moon of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'' is <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>'s best-known song.

<HEAD>Ethics Panels Begin Interviews in Profitable Well Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee Wednesday began interviewing a group of Texans involved in a gas-drilling venture that has so far produced little gas, but resulted in large profits to House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. The panel began two days of scheduled interviews by going behind closed doors to question <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> and his son, <PERSON> Doug </PERSON>, who are friends of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, allowed the speaker and his business partner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> to buy into the well venture last year. At the same time, a special <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics task force created this year to examine <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules and ethics guidelines opened public hearings on such areas as financial disclosure, outside income, receipt of gifts and use of official resources. Task force chairman <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., also a member of the ethics committee, said the panel hoped to learn from lawmakers' ethics problems to draft clarifications in the rules and achieve better education of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members and While <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON> sought to isolate the hearing from the current atmosphere of the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> case, former Rep. <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, hit it head on. `` Your preoccupation with each other's ethics is preventing you from doing your jobs,'' <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> testified. `` It is taking too much of your time, and worse, it is creating an atmosphere and an institution in which suspicion, bitterness, personal dislikes and private vendettas make cooperative efforts in writing laws increasingly difficult. And that is serious.'' He added: `` No one learns his ethics in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. No one needs to be told by his colleagues what is right and fair and honorable ... Ethics is not as great a problem with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as is courage.'' Ethics <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the session with <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> had been productive, but would not comment on the businessman's testimony <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>'s lawyer, <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brand </ORGANIZATION>, said the questions generally covered the same ground as a 23-page report on the gas deal which he issued earlier in the week. That report justified the transaction as a legitimate business venture and noted that the remaining partners in the deal plan to drill another well, believing substantial gas deposits remain to be tapped. It was not, the report contended, a gift to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> designed to gain favor and influence over legislation. The <ORGANIZATION> Jaffes </ORGANIZATION> have been competing to sell the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> a new trainer aircraft produced by one of their companies. The Wright-Mallick partnership's $ 9,120 investment last year grew into a $ 340,000 profit over a period of five months, even though the well had been unable to produce commercial quantities of gas. When it announced last week it was charging <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> with 69 House rules violations, the ethics committee said it was continuing to investigate the gas venture, known as the <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> project after its location near the <LOCATION> Louisiana-Texas </LOCATION> line. Also to be interviewed by the committee were <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>; <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestridge </PERSON>, a geologist; <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, who provided the drilling equipment for the <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> well; and <PERSON> Marlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherry </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Jaffes </ORGANIZATION>' bookkeeper The continuing investigation has stalled committee progress toward holding a disciplinary hearing for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the trial-like phase of the ethics process in which evidence is presented and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> will have a chance to make a personal appeal. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> seemed to complain about the slowness on Tuesday, calling the investigation `` a moving target'' which was frustrating his efforts to mount a defense. But <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> dismissed that charge, saying the committee is abiding strictly by its rules. `` He will, in an appropriate time, have a chance to respond to all the charges,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said.

 The Courage Foundation, honoring four people who served the public good, issued awards Tuesday to men who fought against crime and inflation, a woman who demanded progress in the classroom and a man who promoted public health. `` The idea is to recognize courage in our senior appointed and elected officials,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, chairman of the New York-based foundation said at a ceremony before granting crystal lions and a $ 5,000 check to the recipients: <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, and teacher <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Pipkin </PERSON>. The Courage Foundation describes itself as a non-partisan, non-political organization that draws its support from people of all political persuasions. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>'s award was for `` promoting the welfare of society in general, not one group over another; and for his vigorous efforts to educate the public about AIDS and cigarette smoking in the face of harsh criticism.'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> told the audience of about 30 he was `` a little embarrassed.'' <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>'s citation, according to a prepared statement, was for `` tightening the money supply during the early 1980s when it was considered an unorthodox approach for combating the country's high inflation rate.'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, who resigned as the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> to run for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> mayor, was selected `` for his prosecution of organized crime kingpins, as well as efforts to weed out corruption in the financial community.'' He said described himself as `` very humbled'' and said he would donate his $ 5,000 award check to a drug rehabilitation program. Ms. <PERSON> Pipkin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, school teacher, was honored `` for spearheading a battle against school officials who banned the classroom use of such books as ` The Red Badge of Courage,' ` Hamlet,' and ` Fahrenheit 451' because they contained material some officials considered inappropriate.'' Ms. <PERSON> Pipkin </PERSON> said in an interview that her suit against the school board is still pending. She said her reading list was opposed by Christian fundamentalists in the area and `` it got caught up in missionary zeal.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s army on Wednesday unveiled a new tank that the inventor says will `` remain forever young'' because of a unique armor system that can be replaced, even on the battlefield. Army commanders said the thick-skinned Merkava Mark 3 can survive anything an enemy infantryman can throw at it, making the tank one of the toughest in the world. Merkava means `` chariot'' in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION>. `` This is the most protected tank against known anti-tank weaponry,'' Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanan </PERSON>, head of the armored corps, told reporters during a visit to the production line at a military base near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. `` The Mark 3 is a step ahead of any tank deployed in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> now,'' he said, adding it was on a par with the new Soviet T-80 and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> M-1A1. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tal </LOCATION>, a retired major generalwho developed the tank and is now a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> adviser, said the revolutionary change in the tank was the construction of modular units and bolt-on armor that can be removed to make way for improvements. This means the tank can get periodic facelifts to keep its skin as tough as possible. This is especially important at a time when armor technology is rapidly changing, he said. `` This tank will remain forever young. It will never be old. The armor can be changed at any time, even in the field,'' said Tal, who led the armored column that seized the Suez Canal from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. In addition to the replaceable armor, some parts of the vehicle such as the fireproof fuel tanks in the rear are modular units that can be changed if upgraded parts are developed. The army screened a film of the low-slung tank tearing across the rocky terrain of northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, making about a 40-foot leap through the air from an earthen embankment while going full tilt. The Mark 3's top speed was not disclosed but it has a U.S.-made 1200 horsepower engine. It also has a larger gun, 120mm instead of the 105mm cannon on earlier models. In chemical, nuclear or biological warfare, the tank can be sealed shut and the crew can operate in an air-conditioned environment without gas masks or cumbersome suits, <PERSON> Tal </PERSON> said. The atmosphere in the cabin is `` over-pressured'' so that air leaks out rather than poison seeping inside, he said. Other unique features of the Merkava include a back door that allows the tank to unload an infantry squad during a battle and a front-mounted engine which doubles as additional armor to protect the crew. The new tank costs $ 2.3 million per unit to develop compared to $ 1.8 million for the Mark 1, first introduced in 1979 and battle-tested against <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s Soviet-made T-62 tanks in the 1982 Lebanon War. Tal said the advent of the Mark 3 means <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> now is in a position to sell its Mark 1 and 2 tanks to foreign countries. He also said special features of the tank, such as the bolt-on armor, could be sold separately to uprgrade existing tanks and other armored vehicles. Despite some contentions that tanks are no longer the dominant force in land battles, <PERSON> Tal </PERSON> contends they will remain a key element of warfare. `` Tanks are considered by both East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as the backbone of warfare on land. This did n't change yet and the assumption is that it wo n't change until the end of the century,'' he said.

<HEAD>Treasury Department Announces New Borrowing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday that it plans to borrow $ 28.75 billion next week to replenish the government's coffers in one of four giant debt auctions it holds during the year. <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> officials said the auctions would include the sale of three-year and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds to refinance $ 17.3 billion in maturing government debt and raise $ 11.5 billion in new cash. The total debt being sold was in line with market expectations and was very similar to the last debt sale held in February. At a briefing for reporters, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> deputy assistant secretary for finance, said that the department expected the government's debt, which currently stands at $ 2.76 trillion, would hit the congressional limit of $ 2.8 billion sometime this summer. `` We will hit the debt ceiling some time this summer and when it occurs, it is our hope that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will raise the debt ceiling in a timely fashion,'' <PERSON> Bremner </PERSON> said. In the past, extended debate over raising the limit on how much the government can borrow has often become embroiled in questions about spending and taxes and has thrown government operations into a turmoil with threatened shutdowns because of a lack of cash. However, administration officials said they hope the recent budget accord reached with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will avoid that situation this year. According to Wednesday's announcement, the auctions for next week will include: _ $ 9.75 billion in three-year notes in minimum denominations of $ 5,000 to be auctioned on Tuesday. _ $ 9.5 billion in 10-year notes in minimum denominations of $ 1,000 to be auctioned on Wednesday. _ $ 9.5 billion in 30-year bonds in minimum denominations of $ 1,000 to be auctioned on Thursday.

<TEXT>
 The chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday for not doing more to stop pesticides banned in this country from showing up in imported food. The government must ensure that foreign buyers of U.S.-made pesticides understand their dangers and protect the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public from imported food contaminated with unsafe pesticides, said Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has failed miserably,'' said <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on environment, energy and natural resources, which has jurisdiction over the agency During a hearing of his subcommittee, <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> inspectors found chlordane, a chemical believed to cause cancer, in two shipments of Honduran beef. `` Our reports show that chlordane is made only in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' but is not allowed to be sold here as pesticide, said <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>. In both cases, most of the Honduran beef had been sold to grocery stores, ground up and purchased by consumers before the chlordane contamination was discovered. <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> criticized the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> for not warning the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> was buying an American-made pesticide that could contaminate beef sold to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It's time for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` to revisit our pesticide export policies,'' he said. During the hearing, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials admitted they ca n't ensure that pesticides outlawed here wo n't show up in imported food. But they also charged that the subcommittee has n't followed its own suggestions for helping other countries better understand the dangers of some pesticides made in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> assistant administrator for policy, planning and evaluation, said the agency was aware more needed to be done. When presented with an internal memo dated April 17, 1987, that outlined improvements needed to better educate foreign buyers and protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> consumers, she conceded that none had been followed. But <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> assured <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> would quickly act on the recommendations, as well as those of international negotiators working to establish a policy for worldwide pesticide use. <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>'s charges against the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> were supported by a report from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, an investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has no established procedures for deciding when to notify foreign countries about pesticides the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has designated dangerous to human health. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> also has no standards for determining whether action taken against pesticides in this country are significant enough to warn another nation, according to the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report. Under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law, pesticides that are banned or unregistered domestically can be sold abroad if the foreign buyer provides a statement saying he understands that the product is outlawed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A copy of that statement is provided to the foreign government through the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> does not routinely send out notices to foreign governments when companies voluntarily cancel domestic registrations, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The agency is considering improvements to its present procedures, including those reocmmended by <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>.

In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday ruled out negotiations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on short-range nuclear missiles and the White House portrayed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s disagreement with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> as a sign of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s vitality <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> stirred the long-simmering dispute over short-range nuclear forces _ which arms negotiators call <ORGANIZATION> SNF </ORGANIZATION> _ into a full-fledged controversy last week when he called for negotiations aimed at `` the third zero,'' or ultimate elimination of short-range missiles. Talks are already in progress to cut the superpower arsenals of long-range missiles, and the December 1987 agreement on intermediate-range forces set out the total removal of those weapons to reach the first zero. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> opposes negotiations on short-range missiles, claiming the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> has a predominance in conventional arms and that until a balance is achieved the Western alliance needs to retain a nuclear option. But West German fears of becoming a nuclear battleground intensified in recent months because most of the short-range missiles _ the only nuclear weapons not under negotiation _ are based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s 88 Lance missile launchers deployed in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, 76 are in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The rockets have a range of about 75 miles, so their use would mean fighting a nuclear war on West German territory. The <ORGANIZATION> SNF </ORGANIZATION> flareup triggered a flurry of diplomatic efforts to work out a compromise that would satisfy all 16 member nations of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials here and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> say they presented ideas to resolve the impasse, but no visible signs emerged that the dispute would soon be put to rest. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> said Wednesday it had communicated a compromise plan to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, but External Affairs spokesman <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarrazin </PERSON> said no details would be disclosed. A senior <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the Canadian proposal was `` under review'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> but said he could not comment further. Government spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> was asked at a news conference if <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> would insist on opening short-range talks before <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s next federal elections in December 1990, or if timing of the forum was a possible area of compromise. `` A lot of things are possible,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> replied vaguely. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who briefed reporters in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> on condition of anonymity, expressed confidence the <ORGANIZATION> SNF </ORGANIZATION> debate would be ironed out by the end of the month when leaders of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations meet in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> for their annual summit. Dutch Premier <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> talked with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> earlier Wednesday on ways of breaking the impasse, but officials refused to discuss details. On Tuesday, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> met with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> as part of an apparent campaign to gain support for <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s position. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> support it on short-range talks and resistance to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s replacing the Lance systems with new missiles capable of reaching targets 300 miles away. But Italian Premier <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> said his country favors linking the <ORGANIZATION> SNF </ORGANIZATION> forum to progress toward a balance of conventional arms between East and West, a condition also stipulated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.

<BYLINE>Bennett: Drug Punishment Certainty More Crucial than Severity ^By
CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stiff prison sentences are fine, the administration's top drug-control official said Wednesday, but in drug cases `` certainty of punishment is more important than severity.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>, told several hundred members of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interreligious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> that his approach to the drug problem can be summed up in the words, `` consequences and confrontation.'' `` Those who use, sell and traffic in drugs must be confronted, and they must suffer consequences,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. He is working on a strategy for drug control nationwide, with a report due in early September. While saying there is broad agreement on such consequences as `` seizure of assets, stiffer prison sentences, revocation of bail rights and the death penalty for drug kingpins,'' he added, `` I also find that we lack the resources to assure that consequences always follow crime.'' He called for more prisons and jails and for more investigators, prosecutors and judges, but also said, `` More and tougher action will not be enough. `` I think we need to reorient our process of justice where drugs are concerned, and adopt the principle that certainty of punishment is more important than severity of punishment,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` Those guilty of drug offenses must believe that punishment is inevitable. As long as they do n't, the deterrent effect of incarceration is neutralized.'' After the speech, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he was n't suggesting reduced sentences for drug offenders, including what he termed casual users. `` I am for severe penalties, particularly when a drug crime is severe, but what you have to have is certain punishment,'' he said. `` You should n't make certain punishment hostage to severe punishment. `` What that means is a person that commits a drug crime has to know they're going to be punished. And if you have to sacrifice an extra six months of punishment in order to be sure the person gets some punishment, make sure they get some punishment,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` It would be better in many situations to have everyone that's convicted of drug use to go to jail for a week ... than to just get a third of them going for six months.'' As an example, he cited a practice in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, where he said police arrested drug users, many of them middle-class, and `` put them in jail for a weekend, that's all, just a weekend. For a lot of middle-class users, that is plenty of time. ... They are cured after one weekend in the slammer.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> acknowledged that such an idea would be for state and local governments to carry out and that he, as director of national drug control policy, would not be imposing such regulations on the federal level. But he said local officials have asked him repeatedly during his two months on the job to let them know if there are any good ideas floating around, and the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> example is one he's advocating. Another local example he touted was that of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where `` parents are brought before the juvenile justice court and made to answer for the actions of their children through civil penalties.'' `` This policy establishes the principle that parents ... must bear responsibility for the behavior and the activities of minors in their charge,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` Minors who are non-addicted users must be taught early on that they can not behave with impunity, and parents who have effectively turned them loose must learn why the social contract demands that they oversee and control the impulses of their children.'' Asked later if that included jailing parents for their children's transgressions, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said that should occur only in `` extreme cases.'' As for treatment and rehabilitation of drug offenders, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told the coalition that `` in many cases, rehabilitation is the wrong term to use.'' `` In the case of 15-year-old offenders who have grown up essentially without parents, some therapists I have talked to have found it necessary to serve as substitute parents, complete with a tuck-in and bedtime story at night,'' he said.

<HEAD>Producer-Financed Soybean Promotion, Research Program Proposed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was asked Wednesday to set up a $ 60 million soybean research and promotion program financed by a levy on domestic soybean production. Proposed legislation, developed by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soybean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, would provide for a nationwide `` checkoff'' similar to programs involving other commodities, including those for dairy, pork and beef producers. Money from a mandatory assessment would pay for farmer-run programs to expand exports, develop new uses for soybeans and promote soybean products through a national advertising campaign. The program would be administered by state and national boards composed of soybean producers. `` This program is and will be farmer-bred, farmer-fed and farmer-led,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Camilla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soybean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. At a news conference, Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., said the legislation would give `` American soybean farmers a war chest of their own'' to combat promotional and research efforts of foreign competitors Currently, 26 states have soybean promotion programs generating a total of about $ 15 million, and the national levy would replace those. The proposed rate of assessment would be one-half percent of the net market value of soybeans sold by a farmer _ 50 cents for every $ 100 in sales. Half of the estimated $ 60 million in collections would go to state programs. If the legislation is enacted, the assessment would be implemented and a producer referendum would be held 18 to 36 months later to determine whether it should continue.

 Uniform national standards on such things as cleanliness and food quality at boarding homes for the elderly would override state regulations and be enforced by surprise inspections under legislation introduced Wednesday by Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>. `` We need to act immediately to end the abuse of our elderly and disabled,'' Pepper, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said in a statement `` This bill seeks to eradicate what is truly a tragedy of epic proportions.'' He said many of the homes visited by congressional inspectors `` were n't fit for roaches, let alone the frail elderly and disabled people who were forced to live there.'' A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aging </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on health said Pepper, who has been under hospital care since April 6, signed the legislation last week during a visit to his office and it was formally filed with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> clerk Wednesday. In a subcommittee report released earlier, investigators determined there are more 1 million elderly and disabled residents living in more than 68,000 board and care homes. Pepper said subcommittee investigators conducted unannounced inspections of board and care homes in 10 states and `` found evidence of fraud, waste and abuse in every state.'' Federal and state governments spend an estimated $ 7 billion a year to support elderly and disabled people in the homes, mostly through the federal Supplemental Security Income program.

<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Peace talks involving three of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s four factions ended Wednesday with glowing reports of progress and plans for more negotiations. `` We have made tremendous progress. We achieved concrete results,'' said Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, former ruler of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and leader of the three-party resistance coalition. `` I symbolize <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' he said. All four factions want the prince to return as head of state. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which has the strongest army in the coalition, did not attend the <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> meeting, the third in 10 months. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in December 1979 deposed the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which killed hundreds of thousands of people during its reign from 1975. The three other factions oppose its return to power. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, premier of the Vietnam-sponsored government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, spoke on Wednesday of `` quite big progress'' and the promise of more to come. A <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> radio broadcast said it rejected conciliatory moves by <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s government as merely an effort to legitimize itself. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> will reject everything because they are interested in the continuation of the war.'' He quoted <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> as saying, `` Let the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> stay in the jungle.'' Even the more sober assessment of former premier <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>, leader of the third guerrilla group, acknowledged points of agreement at the <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> meeting. He issued a statement saying a compromise was expected to resolve `` the external aspect'' of the conflict that began with the invasion. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has pledged to withdraw all its military forces from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by Sept. 30. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said he would decide whether to return as head of state after complete withdrawal of Vietnamese forces was confirmed and the constitution was amended to guarantee a multi-party political system. `` I think my demands will be met,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON>, foreign minister of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, have been asked to devise an international control plan and prepare a conference to consider it, Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> said. The conference is scheduled for July 24-25 in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> told reporters participants in the conference should include the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, the four factions, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations: the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>. The five permanent <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. An international control plan is intended to keep the peace between the Vietnamese withdrawal and elections. It probably will include representatives of two Western nations, two communist countries and two from the group professing non-alignment. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>, who lead non-communist resistance groups, had demanded a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force but agreed to compromise. In return, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> had his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> change the country's name from <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kampuchea </ORGANIZATION> to the State of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and promised several constitutional and other changes. Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> were not content with the changes, however, and <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>'s statement said: `` We agree to disagree on the internal aspect.'' He accused <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> of wanting to take the two non-communist factions into his party and freeze out the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in hopes of getting the recognition at the conference that has been withheld by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The resistance coalition holds <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s seat in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The guerrilla factions want a four-party coalition during the interim from Vietnamese withdrawal to elections.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took a break from a tightly scheduled potpourri of meetings Wednesday for an afternoon tennis game with pro <PERSON> Bjorn </PERSON> <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> and two other Swedes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Borg </PERSON> teamed up against Swedish Ambassador <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtmeister </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ove </PERSON> <PERSON> Benstson </PERSON>, a former Davis Cup champion, in a doubles match on the White House court. The president, dressed in white shorts and shirt with a yellow vest and a white windbreaker that he shed after about 10 minutes of warming up, energetically raced across the court and bounded back and forth to the net. He apologized for his bad shots and hit his share of good ones. One shot into the net produced a particular grimace from the president and an expletive between clenched teeth. `` Sorry,'' he said quickly. When a reporter complimented the president on his game, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` Answer to this game is to get a good partner.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s serve failed him in the first set. He double faulted to lose the game point.

 With final exams just two weeks away, a union of 3,200 graduate assistants walked out of <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> classrooms Wednesday and onto picket lines to press a demand for recognition as employees. `` Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Union busting's got to go!'' sign-carrying teaching and research assistants chanted as they demonstrated at every major entrance to the campus. Their union based here, the Association for Graduate Student Employees, is affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, and is the vanguard of a burgeoning movement challenging the traditional view of graduate students as scholars living off stipends. The students say they are underpaid, overworked and often forced to go without health and other benefits. `` This is not a question of mainly getting more money for me; it's a matter of justice,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Martel </PERSON>, a 24-year-old teaching assistant in the political science department. `` We're not a bunch of <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> radicals demanding a change in foreign policy; we just want to exercise a basic <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> right to join a union and have our concerns represented at a bargaining table,'' added <PERSON> Martel </PERSON>, who joined about 200 pickets as classes were to begin. Union representatives claimed hundreds of classes were canceled on the first day of the two-day strike. The university did not check the number of canceled classes, but a <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> spokesman called the protest largely symbolic. About 90 percent ot the 3,200 graduate assistants took part in the walkout, the association claimed. There are about 9,000 graduate students at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. A victory by the <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> students could legitimize similar demands eat many more campuses, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, a member of the association's executive board. `` The movement nationally on this issue is picking up steam,'' <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> said. `` We're not making demands in a vacuum.'' In the last 10 years, at least five major universities in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> have recognized graduate student assistants as employees. Teaching assistants at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> won collective bargaining from the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. Their union, affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, is negotiating their second contract. At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, the university and its newly organized teaching assistants reached a collective bargaining agreement earlier this year giving assistants a 14 percent pay raise over the next two years. At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, the coordinating committe of the teaching assistants' union voted last week to affiliate with the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> union has been seeking recognition since 1983. Last week, the state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, ruling 2-1 in favor of a university appeal, said a 1979 law forbids graduate students from being treated as employees because their work duties are part of scholarly training. The association plans to appeal to court. At the start of <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>'s school day, <LOCATION> Sproul </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION>, where one-fifth of students generally enter, was unusually quiet. Protesters handed out yellow armbands to supporters. `` The teaching assistants are the university when it comes to learning here,'' said undergraduate <PERSON> Cammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Starks </PERSON>, 21, who said her morning classes had been canceled and wore an armband. `` Everything I've learned, I've learned from the assistants, not professors who hardly ever get to know you.'' Anthropology Professor <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Berreman </PERSON>, who joined pickets, said graduate students handle 90 percent of the paper grading. `` I'm here to show them how important they are to faculty,'' he said On Tuesday, 71 professors in 10 departments sent a letter to Chancellor <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> endorsing the walkout and the association's call for teaching assistants to cancel or reschedule classes. <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> has 1,350 tenured professors. The association said that at least 500 Wednesday and Thursday classes were canceled or rescheduled. According to a selective survey by the association of 307 classes through Wednesday afternoon, 66 percent were canceled, 25 percent were less than half-full, and 9 percent were at capacity. University spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Debley </PERSON> said the results were not necessarily representative of the campus, which has 23,000 undergraduates. He said it's not unusual for some students to skip classes in the final weeks before finals to gain time to prepare papers. <PERSON> Debley </PERSON> said the cost of pay raises and for providing health and other benefits could have a substantial impact on university budgets. According to a study by the association, teaching assistants handle 58 percent of classroom work involving undergraduate students and research assistants do about half the laboratory work. The university contends the work can not be considered employment because it is so intertwined with educational experience, <PERSON> Debley </PERSON> said. Students receive annual stipends from the university or research institutions averaging about $ 10,000 annually. `` It is more of a learning experience than an employment experience,'' <PERSON> Debley </PERSON> said.

The Miaras say the twins are theirs. `` The children feel very badly and obviously I'm not doing too well either,'' <PERSON> Miara </PERSON> told reporters shortly before police arrived at their <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> home to take them to the airport. Another couple, former <ORGANIZATION> Argentine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Norberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Susana </PERSON>, are awaiting final legal proceedings in a similar case involving two children. Both couples fled to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, then under the rule of authoritarian president Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, in April 1986 after human rights groups accused them of stealing children of pregnant women who disappeared during a military crackdown on leftist subversion. Both couples refused to return to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, claiming they were victims of political persecution and would not receive a fair trial. Argentine requests for the extradition of the couples were tied up in the courts for two years and strained relations between the two nations. Argentine Ambassador <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Quijano </PERSON> was recalled for three months in 1987 after the Paraguayan attorney general recommended against extradition. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> and his 34-year regime were ousted in a military coup on Feb. 3. Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, elected president in Monday's national elections, and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> approved extradition of the Miaras on March 6 <PERSON> Adalberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossetti </PERSON>, who claims to be the real father of the <LOCATION> Miara </LOCATION> boys, has said that his wife, <PERSON> Liliana </PERSON>, 21 at the time, was four months pregnant when she was arrested by security forces for allegedly subversive activity as a student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plata </ORGANIZATION>. She never was seen again. <PERSON> Rossetti </PERSON>, an attorney in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, said he has never seen the boys.

 The judge in the <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> trial said Wednesday he has imposed a 9-to-5 workday on the jury but wo n't push harder for a verdict in the deliberations, which continued inconclusively for the 11th day `` I see no reason why I should intervene with the jury at all,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> told lawyers for <PERSON> North </PERSON> and the government _ both of whom had raised questions about the lengthy deliberations. `` There is nothing the court can do to say that people must deliberate,'' he said. `` I have no reason to think they are n't deliberating; they are human beings and they are going to set their own pace. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> pointed out that `` not long ago a jury in this courthouse took two months to reach a decision'' _ apparently referring to the trial of nine members of a <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> sect convicted on racketeering charges in 1986 by a jury that deliberated 200 hours over 36 days. The nine women and three men on the North jury generally have worked on the case five or six hours each weekday and a half-day on Saturday. `` I felt that time was being wasted,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. `` They are not starting as early as they could have and they have been leaving at 4:15. I felt I should hold them in there until five.'' He said he told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals, who transport the jurors from the hotel where they are sequestered, `` to get them in by nine and take them home by five.'' And so, at 5:03 p.m., the van pulled away from the courthouse and the jury had completed another seven hours of work _ a total of about 60 hours since it got the case on April 20. A court official said deliberations stopped at 4:45. Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> had suggested that <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> might summon jurors to the courtroom each day to learn what hours they wanted to work the following day and to advise them they could deliberate longer. The judge said the new hours would take care of that and an eight-hour day was reasonable. The jurors, he said, worked shorter days earlier because several suffered from colds and one had problems with high blood pressure. North lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> asked why the jurors, who had been using <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s courtroom, had returned to a smaller deliberation room where they had complained of being crowded. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he needed the courtroom for other business and the crowding problem had been solved by removing excess chairs. `` I think we'll just have to wait it out together until we hear something concrete from them,'' he told the lawyers. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> replied that `` we are running out of books -LRB- to read -RRB- in our office.'' Said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>: `` I understand there is a movie you could look at'' _ an apparent reference to the two-part television drama on `` The Rise and Fall of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'' that finished Tuesday night. Charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> include lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the attorney general and obstructing investigations into the Iran-Contra affair, particularly his <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> efforts to help the Nicaraguan rebels at a time when official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid was banned. Other charges accuse <PERSON> North </PERSON> of illegally profiting from the enterprise. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> urged <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to deny a news media request for a document that was given to the jury but not to the press. The department said the news organizations should pursue the matter through the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ `` the executive branch agency responsible for classifying the information at issue.'' Said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>: `` This court can not serve as a substitute for such a process.'' The organizations pressing for the document _ a summary of intelligence `` intercepts'' made while a shipment of missiles was being sent to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1985 _ are The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have reached a tentative agreement over driftnet fishing in the northern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON> <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON>, D-Wash., outlined details of what she said is an agreement that might end the dispute over use of the huge nets She was critical of the pact. An estimated 700 fishing boats from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> use driftnets, which can stretch 35 miles in length and cover more than 30,000 square miles of ocean on any given day. American fishermen claim that vessels from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> use driftnets to illegally snare millions of tons of salmon under the guise of squid fishing. Fishing groups have said the illegal fishing has already impacted salmon runs in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON>, D-Wash., released what she said are details of the pact, based on talks with unnamed officials from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fishing industry She said the pact calls for:

<TEXT>
 _ 2 observers stationed aboard Japanese driftnet vessels to monitor their catch. There are an estimated 400 vessels in the Japanese driftnet fleet. _ An increase from four to five in the number of Japanese patrol vessels in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and an increase in patrol days for the vessels from the current 250 per year to 600 per year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> enforcement officers will be stationed aboard the patrol vessels. _ Stiffer Japanese penalties for ships caught illegally driftnet fishing. _ Marking of all driftnets so the owners of those cast adrift can be identified. _ A ban on the high-seas transfer of fish between Japanese trawlers and freighters, which carry the fish back to port. <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON> said the Japanese refused to agree to a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> request for a pilot program to place transponders on a dozen or so Japanese vessels. Using satellites, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> could have monitored the movements of the ships. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is considering a transponder test using American vessels, <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON> said. Other congressional sources, who asked not to be identified, confirmed most of the details supplied by <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON>, but added that the agreement was for only one year and the Japanese have essentially told the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` take it or leave it.'' The sources also said the Japanese have indicated they plan to move the legal driftnet zone slightly northward, though exactly how far remains unclear. The existing driftnet zone was designed to keep fishing vessels far south of the migration routes of North American salmon. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s ambassador for ocean and fisheries, was out of his office and unavailable for comment Wednesday. Earlier this week, <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that an agreement with the Japanese was close. Congressional sources said the agreement has actually been signed by Japanese officials and initialed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators. `` I am extremely apprehensive that this agreement will not be adequate,'' said <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON>. `` I am also not sure that this will meet the requirements of the 1987 Driftnet Act.'' Under that act, if <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other countries with driftnet fleets have not entered into monitoring and enforcement agreements with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by June 29, the president could impose trade sanctions. <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON> said she was upset that the Japanese had refused to agree to a transponder test program. `` We may have negotiated away our ability to put any teeth in our action,'' she said. `` It's absolutely goofy. If they are n't violating any existing agreements, why are they objecting to us placing transponders on their ships? <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON> also said she felt the number of observers called for in the agreement falls short of what was needed to provide `` sufficient'' data on the impact of driftnet fishing.

 A Palestinian shouting `` God is great!'' stabbed to death two elderly Israelis and wounded three others Wednesday at a bus stop in the heart of Jewish west <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police said. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a Palestinian laborer stabbed and slightly wounded a Jew from <ORGANIZATION> Etz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Efraim </ORGANIZATION>, a small settlement near the Arab city of <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>, the army said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the settler, 38-year-old <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> <PERSON> Meshumar </PERSON>, was stabbed five times. After the stabbing in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police used tear gas to break up a march by Jewish extremists, who were led by American-born Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> and shouted `` Revenge!'' <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> and six followers were arrested on charges of disturbing public order and refusing orders to disperse. Members of <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>'s anti-Arab Kach party later beat up several Arabs near a Jewish Orthodox neighborhood, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio reported. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> has been relatively free of violence that has plagued Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> since the Palestinian uprising began 17 months ago. The stabbing occurred on <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, the city's busiest shopping street, at about 11 a.m. Dozens of passers-by chased and caught the 25-year-old attacker as he fled with a bloody, eight-inch knife. Police dragged the suspect into a nearby flower shop to protect him from an angry crowd shouting: `` Death to the terrorists! Death to the Arabs!'' <PERSON> Vardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalman </PERSON>, a 60-year-old lawyer, died shortly afterward. <PERSON> Nissim </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, 91, died later in a hospital. The other victims, including a woman in her 90s, were in fair condition. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> linked the stabbing to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s current visit to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` This is a cruel murder by fanatical savages, mad with hate, who are pushed to such acts also by this kind of visits. When they see their leader and idol, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, received in presidential palaces, they know he's received their thanks for their killings,'' he said. Speaking on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said it did not matter to what group the attacker belonged because his act was in <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s `` spirit and according to his orders and the orders of his friends They have not changed and are not able to change anything in their ideology, aspirations, hopes and aims.'' There was speculation the stabbing came in response to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statement in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> disavowing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> charter, which calls for the elimination of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said the assailant was a member of <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION>, a fundamentalist Moslem group opposed to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s existence. He added that the attacker's brother `` was apparently detained and maybe beaten during the weekend, and this was the background,'' in addition to nationalistic and religious motives. The deaths brought to 20 the number of Israelis killed in the uprising. More than 450 Palestinians have died. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Police Commissioner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Krauss </PERSON> said he was calling in reinforcements to protect the city's <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> residents. `` We will have to keep these forces here for days to prevent any attempt on innocent people, be they Jews or Arabs,'' he said. Police said the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> assailant had been questioned about unspecified `` terrorist activities'' in the past. They said he apparently had no accomplices. <PERSON> Romi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON>, who was sitting in a nearby restaurant when the attack occurred, said the man shouted `` Allahu Akbar!'' _ `` God is great!'' in Arabic. `` He was going crazy and started stabbing people,'' <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sima </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozer </PERSON>, an employee in a nearby flower shop, said the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was caught outside. `` A policeman came and stopped the crowd from lynching him,'' she said. `` Police threw him on the floor of the flower shop ... while people outside were shouting, ` Kill him! Kill him! Death to the Arabs!'''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> on Wednesday released a target list of Japanese products which could face 100 percent duties, doubling their price in this country, under trade retaliation being considered by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The list of potential target products for the higher tariffs ranges from color televisions to tape recorders and photocopying machines. The broad variety of goods, including some of the most popular Japanese electronic devices sold in this country, served to emphasize the seriousness with which the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is viewing this latest trade dispute with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> announced on Friday that the government was considering sanctions against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> because of a finding by the administration that the country has not opened its telecommunications market to American companies. Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said at the time that the retaliation could be avoided if the Japanese make meaningful concessions. A final list of products which could be subject to the higher tariffs will be drawn up after a hearing scheduled for May 24. That list will be selected from the broader one released on Wednesday. In making the telecommunications decision, Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> found that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had limited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access to its market for car telephones and business radios. The <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the principal American maker of these products, has contended that it has been denied access to the Japanese market. It maintains that with fair access it could achieve sales in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of about $ 400 million a year. The Japanese have argued that there is a shortage of radio frequencies for such services.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s controversial plan to run <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION>'s ailing schools went to state lawmakers Wednesday, with supporters confident the promised renaissance will dispel doubts about putting a public concern in private hands. `` This is the happiest day of my 45 years in <LOCATION> Chelsea </LOCATION>,'' said Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, who sent the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> a home rule petition that would install <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> as manager of its school system. The proposal has the backing of Democrat <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Voke </PERSON>, chairman of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and is expected to pass. Others were less enthusiastic. <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON> was against the proposal, citing concerns that the university would not consult with parents, teachers and administrators. Supporters say the plan is <PERSON> Chelsea </PERSON>'s last chance to escape the plague of poverty: shabby buildings, low test scores and a high school dropout rate of 17 percent. Opponents, including teachers and Hispanic groups, say the proposal also would turn <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> into a experimental education laboratory for university students. Hispanics oppose the contract, signed by representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION>'s schools, saying university officials have ignored requests for more information about bilingual programs. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Silber </PERSON> said he would heed concerns raised. `` We are not going to privatize the schools,'' <PERSON> Silber </PERSON> said. `` We are going to manage the public schools and they are going to remain public.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> criticized the signing of the contract before lawmakers act as `` indicative of the private and arrogant manner in which the entire process ... has been conducted.'' <PERSON> Chelsea </PERSON>, a city of about 25,000 with a sizable immigrant population, has seen its tax base shrink and faces cuts of about $ 2.8 million in next year's school budget due to a statewide budget crunch. <PERSON> Silber </PERSON> said he would lobby for funds from private donors, the federal government and the state, advertising the reforms of <LOCATION> Chelsea </LOCATION> as a possible road to reviving the area a few miles from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` Chelsea is a city waiting for a renaissance to happen,'' <PERSON> Silber </PERSON> said. `` If we can improve those schools, people will move back into <LOCATION> Chelsea </LOCATION>.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday approved legislation to protect open land and build recreational facilities, but Republicans on the committee walked out in protest before the committee took its vote. The bill, known as the American Heritage Trust Act, would make the existing land and water conservation fund and historic preservation fund permanent trusts that would generate $ 1 billion a year for land acquisition and construction of recreational facilities like golf courses, ball fields, pools and marinas. Republicans on the committee objected to more government buying of land. `` This nation's heritage is private ownership of land, not public owners and control,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>.

 A federal grand jury on Wednesday indicted two men, including a former top city official who is a friend of Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, on charges they steered $ 3 million in contracts to friends. Prosecutors alleged that some of the money in what they described as `` a seamy web of corruption,'' ended up in <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s 1986 reelection campaign fund, but they did n't say how A source familiar with <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s 1986 campaign, commenting on condition he not be named, said the two indicted men organized an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> fund-raiser for <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s reelection bid. The indictment does not mention the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> event. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, who formerly served as director of the city's human services department, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyburn </PERSON>, a prominent contractor, were indicted on charges of conspiring to defraud the city government by steering health services contracts to friends and to a company owned by <PERSON> Clyburn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, a close friend of <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, also faces two counts of agreeing to accept a bribe, while <PERSON> Clyburn </PERSON> has been charged with helping to bribe him. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said in a prepared statement, `` I should remind the public that an indictment does not automatically mean an individual is guilty.'' He added, `` I will have no further comment. ... My focus continues to be on managing the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> government.'' The charges come after a 21-month grand jury probe that followed a two-year undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation into the city's contracting procedures. If convicted of all charges, the two men could face maximum prison terms of 50 years. `` This indictment alleged a seamy web of corruption, of concealment, of manipulation and of self-dealing by one of the most senior officials in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> government,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>. `` The investigation is continuing ... and a number of other issues remain in this case.'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> alleged that both <PERSON> Clyburn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> took `` about 10 percent off the top'' in kickbacks for the 20 contracts and contract extensions mentioned in the indictment. He declined to elaborate on how much money might have been steered to <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s 1986 reelection bid, or whether the mayor or any of his top campaign officials were aware of the situation. <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> was out of town Wednesday, his attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> said before the indictment was announced that he was unaware of any pending charges. The 49-page indictment charges that from 1983 through May 1987, <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clyburn </PERSON> influenced the city's contracting process to steer both sole-source and competitively-bid contracts to their friends. <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> took a leave of absence from his city job in August 1987 after he became a target of the investigation.

 A judge who freed a man imprisoned for 21 years in the poisoning deaths of his seven children said the killer's identity may never be known, and raised several questions about the investigation and prosecution. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 53, was released from prison April 25 after Judge <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> determined his 1968 trial was unfair. The former orange picker has moved to a diet clinic run by former comedian <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. A written order overturning <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s conviction was filed Tuesday by <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a retired circuit judge appointed to hear the case. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> offered a long list of unresolved questions in the case. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, a special prosecutor who found evidence of substantial trial errors and perjured testimony, still must recommend whether <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> should face retrial. He was serving a life sentence for first-degree murder in the poisoning death of his eldest stepdaughter Oct. 25, 1967. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s order asked who should be blamed for the unfair trial, why anyone would have wanted to frame <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> as the defense contended, and why three cellmates who testified against <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> told contradictory stories. The judge also wondered how a wino who lived near the <ORGANIZATION> Richardsons </ORGANIZATION> found a bag of the pesticide parathion after an unsuccessful police search, why former police chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> was told to stay off the case, how family baby sitter <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Resse </PERSON> served the poisoned meal and why parathion was found in other parts of the apartment. `` At this late date, who really poisoned the children will quite likely never be known,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> wrote. Prosecutors claimed <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> poisoned the children to collect on $ 1,000 insurance policies, but the jury was never told that the insurance had n't been purchased. Because <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s attorneys agreed the trial was unfair, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said, `` It would serve no useful purpose for the court to now make a detailed finding of fact.'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> did n't rule on whether prosecutors or investigators suppressed evidence or committed perjury. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> ordered an investigation of the allegations of public wrongdoing after <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was freed.

 A <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> woman who rushed out of her shower to dance to a <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> video and was arrested after neighbors peering through her window filed a complaint has sued the police. <PERSON> Darleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, who was jailed and lost her two girls to the state for two days, sued the <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Springs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday for false arrest, harassment and false imprisonment in the January 1988 incident. `` I was treated like a murderer, like I was no good. I was in my own house minding my own business,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a 31-year-old nurse's aide. She said she had asked her daughters to call her out of the shower if a music video of the song `` Love Overboard'' by <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> and the Pips appeared on the television. Neighbors peering through a window into her third-floor apartment thought she was nude when she rushed into her living room to dance to the song, and filed a child abuse report with the police. She later told officers she was wearing a brown towel. She was arrested on three counts of lewd and lascivious behavior in the presence of a child _ her two daughters and a 14-year-old girl looking through the window, said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>, who is representing Ms. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. While she spent a night in the <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stockade </LOCATION>, her daughters, aged three and 10 at the time, spent about two days in separate foster homes. The separation was prolonged because social workers with the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> `` could n't find one of the girls'' after they placed her in a home, <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> said The State Attorney's Office dropped all the charges against <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> in May 1988. <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> declined comment on the suit, saying he had not seen it. Ms. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s suit charges the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deprived her of state and constitutional rights and failed to teach officers how to handle alleged child abuse cases. The complaint also says police ignored accepted practice by not allowing social workers to investigate before taking the children away from the mother.

 A Yap islander found drifting in a life raft told authorities he abandoned his tuna boat after fumes from rotting fish apparently killed two other men aboard the vessel, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships were sent to tow the vessel to port, but their crews were warned to stay upwind to avoid the fumes. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, who was safely aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter Cape <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON> on Wednesday, told authorities he abandoned the 85-foot, Seattle-based trawler <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> G </PERSON> after fumes overcame two crewmates `` in a matter of seconds,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> told officials after his rescue Tuesday that the trawler's refrigeration system failed during a trip to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> that began April 22 at <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory about 2,300 miles south of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yap </PERSON>, part of the <LOCATION> Federated </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION>, is about 540 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> said that on Sunday, the other crewmember went down into a hold and did not return, and when the captain went to investigate, he was also overcome, leaving <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> alone, according to <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> told authorities he headed the vessel toward <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> but had problems with a steering linkage and later a generator malfunction, <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said. On Monday, <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> said, he woke to find himself succumbing to the fumes, so he abandoned the vessel after closing all the hatches, <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said the crewmen may have been overcome by hydrogen sulfide, which is produced by rotting organic material. `` It is very toxic and it takes the oxygen out of the air,'' <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said. `` If it's rotting fish, this could happen.'' The Japanese ship Sun Harvest rescued Moon Tuesday evening 300 miles south of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> was later transferred to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter and was reported in `` good condition and good spirits.'' <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships were at the scene Wednesday but were instructed to remain 2,000 yards upwind from the <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> G </PERSON>, <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said. Crewmembers were told to rig the vessel for towing but not to go below deck, he added. `` The fumes are really bad,'' he said. `` The vessel will be towed to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, but a decision has not been made what to do after that.'' <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said the investigation was complicated by the fact that hydrogen sulfide is highly combustible. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s raft was spotted Tuesday morning by the crew of a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> plane following an emergency distress beacon signal that was picked up by commercial aircraft and the worldwide Search and Rescue Satellite Assisted Tracking computer system, said spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Goff </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> was about two miles from the Margaret G, which when viewed from the air showed no evidence of damage and no sign of life, <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> life raft containing a radio and food and water was dropped, and <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> swam to it from his raft to await pickup by the Japanese ship, <PERSON> Goff </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Investigation, Manhunt Continue in Drug-Cult Murder Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The international investigation of a murderous cult of suspected drug smugglers continued Wednesday, officials said, but the reported high priest and priestess of the group remained at large. Fifteen people found last month buried west of the border city of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, are believed to be victims of the drug gang. Some of the dead were mutilated in human sacrificial rites intended to bring magical power to the contraband business, officials and suspects said. Four of the five men in custody in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> said the cult leaders were <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON>, 24. <PERSON> Constanzo </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Aldrete </PERSON>, missing since the first 12 bodies were uncovered April 11, are among 11 people indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on a four-count drug indictment. The pair flew from <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on April 11, officials have said. In the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> capital, the investigation has led to searches of residences where occult altars were found.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo threatened on Wednesday to invoke emergency powers, which could mean martial law, if students and workers continue the kind of violent protest in which six riot policemen were killed. He said his government was determined to stop the wave of radical protest that has battered <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in recent weeks, but he did not outline specific action in a televised speech to the nation. `` If violence and illegal acts endanger democracy and the future of the country, I would be obliged to invoke emergency measures as empowered by the constitution,'' he said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s constitution permits the president to rule by decree or impose martial law in cases of emergency. Radical students are trying to bring down <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s government and have forrmed alliances with striking workers. They are a powerful minority on campuses, but lack public support because of their extremism and violent tactics. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s warning responded to the killing of six riot troopers early Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> Dongui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>, a southern stronghold of the opposition. People seldom are killed in South Korean protests. Riot officers wear protective helmets and shields, along with fireproof fatigues, and normally are armed only with tear gas and batons. The six who died were set afire when they broke into a room on the seventh floor of the university library to free five comrades held hostage. They were the first policemen killed since a riot officer died in June 1987. Authorities said students seized the hostages Tuesday after a violent demonstration against the firing of warning shots by police on Monday when protesters menaced a police station. Students hurled firebombs and set fire to a barricade drenched with paint thinner as the policemen were climbing over it. Some officers wrapped in flames jumped out of windows and others were burned to death or asphyxiated, police said. Ten officers were in critical condition and police said they expected more to die. Officials said about 10 other policemen and students suffered minor injuries. About 700 police raided the school, firing tear gas. Eighty-eight arrests were reported and the hostages later were freed unharmed. <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong-suk </PERSON>, chief of the national police, resigned after about 150 officers in <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> conducted a sit-down protest and accused senior officers of mishandling the assault. His office said it was the worst loss of police life in recent years. The Education Ministry ordered the <LOCATION> Dongui </LOCATION> campus closed indefinitely. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said in his speech Wednesday: `` It has become clear that, behind the flames that took the lives of young people, there are revolutionary groups which resort to violence to achieve their goals.'' He said the government was prepared to crush radical groups and halt what he called the use of universities and factories as revolutionary bases. `` It is time for us to make a firm resolution to mobilize whatever means to get rid of violence in this society.'' Opposition leaders also denounced violence and urged students and workers to end their protests. News reports Wednesday said the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Cultural Center in the provincial city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, a frequent target of radical students, would be closed temporarily and moved to a location as yet undetermined. Police said they expected more violence in <LOCATION> Masan </LOCATION>, a strike-ridden industrial city near <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> where militant labor groups scheduled a huge rally for Thursday. Thousands of workers in the city held violent protests all last week. Officials said about 7,000 riot policemen were being assembled in <LOCATION> Masan </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION>. News reports said police set up barricades Wednesday outside <LOCATION> Masan </LOCATION> and made arrests. About 3,800 officers have been injured this year by firebombs, rocks, clubs and iron bars, police said. Police and government officials are seeking laws to provide tough punishment for users of firebombs.

 Premier <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> formally submitted the resignation of his seven-year coalition government Wednesday, and early elections are being scheduled for Sept. 6 or 13, the government announced.

 Two men who wrote a book claiming they helped Soviet spy <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> escape to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> from a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> jail 33 years ago were arrested on Wednesday. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pottle </PERSON>, 50, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Randle </PERSON>, 55, went to a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> police sation at the request of the police and were arrested, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said. They were then escorted to their homes, <PERSON> Pottle </PERSON> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Randle </PERSON> in the northern town of <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION>. They were not charged. A police spokesman, speaking anonymously, said they would be granted bail while a report was sent to the Director of Public Prosectuions, who is responsible for deciding on prosecution. Officers from <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard's Special Branch, which deals with subversion, were searching <PERSON> Pottle </PERSON>'s home when a reporter telephoned him. `` They are putting things in bags. I've been expecting this, so I gathered some items together and they have been in a pile on the kitchen table for about 10 days, waiting,'' <PERSON> Pottle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pottle </PERSON>, an antiques dealer, added that he and <PERSON> Randle </PERSON>, a researcher, expect to go to prison eventually. A new book titled `` The Blake Escape'' by the two men and a TV film about the case described how they harbored <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> after he broke out of Wormwood Scrubs prison in 1966 and how <PERSON> Randle </PERSON> smuggled him out of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in a camper van to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourke </PERSON>, a former fellow prisoner of <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, directed his escape by radio messages. <PERSON> Bourke </PERSON>, now dead, later wrote a book describing how he was invited to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and treated as a hero by the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police. <PERSON> Bourke </PERSON> did not mention <PERSON> Pottle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Randle </PERSON> in his book. Last year, they admitted their part in the case to a reporter. <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> was sentenced to 42 years and jailed in 1961 after pleading guilty to spying for the Soviets throughout the 1950s while working for MI6, the British intelligence gathering agency. The sentence _ the longest sentence for espionage ever handed down by a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> court _ was regarded as representing one year for each betrayed agent. At the end of a secret trial, the judge said <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> was suspected of betraying 42 British agents in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> who are believed to have been killed. <PERSON> Pottle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Randle </PERSON> were founder members with the philosopher <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> of the Committee of 100, which protested nuclear weapons. They met <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> in prison while serving 18-month sentences for organizing a demonstration at a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base. The two men said they helped the spy escape because they felt a 42-year sentence was inhumane. More than 100 lawmakers of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> signed a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> paper demanding <PERSON> Pottle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Randle </PERSON> be prosecuted.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> went on record Wednesday against gasoline tax increases as it and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> cleared roadblocks to approving budgets that carry out a much-criticized deficit-reduction agreement with the White House. The anti-gas tax amendment, offered by Sen. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, passed by voice vote and expressed the `` sense of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'' that motor fuel taxes should remain dedicated to improvements in the highway and transportation system. The vote was a shot across the bow to those eyeing a rise in the gas tax, now at 9.1 cents a gallon, as part of future deficit-reduction efforts. There is no call for such a tax in the $ 1.17 trillion fiscal 1990 spending plans now before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Sources have said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has been considering a gas tax increase, combined with a reduction in the capital gains tax, in the fiscal 1991 budget to be submitted next year. The current spending plan, which the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are considering in slightly different versions, claims about $ 28 billion in deficit reductions and would meet the goal in the Gramm-Rudman law of a deficit no larger than $ 100 billion in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1. Critics contend much of the alleged savings is illusory _ bookkeeping gimmicks, sales of federal assets and other devices that do little to alleviate the government's long-term deficit problem. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders withstood the first serious challenge to their budget plan Wednesday evening, defeating 64-31 a move by Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., to shift $ 3 billion from defense to education programs <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> argued that for the nation to remain economically competitive, `` There are going to have to be some changes in our priorities.'' But he ran into the opposition of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s leadership, which has defended <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' budget deal with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the spending levels that the pact calls for. `` We made an agreement, and I believe it is a responsible and fair agreement,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, debate opened on that chamber's version of the budget after passage of a resolution blocking all but a handful of amendments _ those that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders believed would not pose a threat to the deal. This budget is `` the best possible budget <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can produce for 1990, given the many constraints under which it was developed,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> While not a `` bold approach, ... it is at best a step in the right direction,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., the chairman of theHouse <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has openly suggested a gas tax increase But he told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> he would not offer such legislation without <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support `` I will not encourage or support revenue increases that do n't have the support of the president and a majority of members of both sides of the aisle on my committee,'' he said Much of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action Wednesday amounted to tinkering around with priorities in the domestic area and passing non-binding amendments regarding `` truth in budgeting.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved amendments deploring the use of the Social Security surplus to mask the size of the deficit. It also called for future use of budget projections compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which are less sanguine than White House figures. It also voted to add $ 94 million for AIDS research, and about $ 100 million for law enforcement by slightly reducing other domestic agency budgets. The House planned votes Thursday on several amendments, including a spending freeze plan and a proposal to impose a fee on imported oil. Once the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> complete their budgets, the two chambers must agree on a single resolution. That document serves as the guide for annual spending and tax legislation. To comply with the agreement reached last month with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the budgets follow totals already agreed to for military, foreign aid and domestic spending. They also call for $ 14.2 billion in new revenues from a variety of sources, including $ 5.3 billion in tax increases. How the $ 5.3 billion will be raised remains uncertain. The agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> allowed that decision to await more discussions on what taxes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would agree do not violate his `` no new taxes'' pledge. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, indicated he would seek tax increases exceeding $ 5.3 billion to pay for some tax breaks that would cost the government money. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> did not specify what new taxes he supports. But he listed several tax breaks he favors, including the tax credit for research and development, and a cut in the Medicare surtax for catastrophic illness insurance. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said he was confident something could be worked out. He reminded reporters that former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed and signed 13 tax hikes _ and yet was seen as an enemy of higher taxes.

 Americans want the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, not national governments, to control nuclear and chemical weapons and to take the lead in keeping peace in the world, according to a poll released Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> survey also found strong support for increased American financing of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> programs for peace, food production, population control and health. In conflicts among countries where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has an interest, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces should be used in an effort to accommodate all parties, said 49 percent of the nearly 2,000 adults surveyed. Only 17 percent said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should use force to impose its own solution; 20 percent said `` it depends,'' and 14 percent had no opinion. `` That is, in effect, a tough policy choice, and we were surprised to see a 3-to-1 margin of support for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> intervention rather than unilateral <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurenti </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, a private non-profit group that commissioned the poll. Of the respondents, 46 percent wanted <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> members to spend more money settling regional conflicts peacefully, 11 percent favored less spending, 31 percent said the right amount is spent now, and 11 percent had no opinion. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> should have the power to control the manufacture and spread of chemical weapons in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries, said 49 percent, but 33 percent opposed that and 18 percent were unsure. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> control over nuclear weapons manufacture and proliferation was favored by 36 percent. The same percentage opposed it and 18 percent were unsure. Sixty percent said all <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> members should pay their full dues regularly rather than withholding funds to force changes. Fourteen percent said funds could be withheld, the same number said `` it depends'' and 12 percent had no opinion. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> withheld more than a $ 500 million from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in recent years to force fiscal reforms and because they perceived an anti-Western bias in the organization. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> finally said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would pay all back dues if current reforms continued, and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has reaffirmed the pledge. When asked how much money the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> member countries should spend on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> projects, the respondents favored more funds for most social programs, including eradicating disease and improving health care; slowing population growth through birth control; increasing world food production, and protecting the environment. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said the poll indicated for the first time in more than a decade that more Americans thought the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> was doing a good job than felt it was doing poorly. It was conducted March 11-18 through personal interviews with nearly 2,000 adults chosen at random. <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> said the margin of error was about 3 percent.

 Soul singer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> spent an apparently uneventful 56th birthday in prison Wednesday, with corrections officials saying he had no visitors and probably no birthday cake, either. Warden <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said unless <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> bought a cake from the canteen, he did n't have any birthday cake. The prison menu included chocolate pudding for lunch and sweet potato pie for dinner. `` He wo n't have any birthday cake or anything,'' said deputy warden W.E. Doctor. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is serving a six-year sentence for aggravated assault and failing to stop for police during a chase across the <LOCATION> Georgia-South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> border on Sept. 26. He works on kitchen detail in the mornings and in the evenings, the `` Godfather of Soul,'' whose gold records include `` Please, Please, Please,'' and `` Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,'' conducts the prison choir. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> activist <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said Wednesday in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, that he was continuing his efforts to have <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> released from prison. `` <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has done six months. I think he's done enough time,'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said he would protest the actions of a judge who last week brought <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> from jail to the <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> curthouse to sign autographs. `` I think that his judge has underscored the point I was making for six months, that this is a judicial joke to continue to hold <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said of Circuit Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Eppes </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Partial Resolution of Beef Fight Announced</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on Wednesday announced a partial resolution of a contentious trade dispute with the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> over the issue of hormones in American beef. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said that both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> negotiators had agreed to accept the initial recommendations of a task force studying the dispute. That action will allow resumption of sales of about 15 percent of the $ 100 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef which is normally shipped to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. However, a dispute over the other 85 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef exports remains to be resolved, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. Under the agreement, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef producers who wish to export beef not treated with growth hormones to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> may do so. But American officials said they still maintained that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s ban on imports of beef from cattle raised on growth-producing hormones represented an illegal trade barrier masquerading as a health measure American officials had refused to comply with the ban by certifying Europe-bound beef as hormone-free and instead slapped retaliatory tariffs on European goods valued at about $ 100 million, a sum equal to the lost sales of American beef. However, after the tariffs were imposed on Jan. 1 by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, officials of the incoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration began to search for a compromise to the dispute. At a meeting on Feb. 18, <LOCATION> Mrs. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> agreed to look for a way to certify as hormone-free as much <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef as possible. At the time, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> indicated it would reduce its $ 100 million in punitive tariffs by the amount of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was willing to accept. The agreement Wednesday follows the recommendations of a task force of officials from both sides established to study the matter. The partial resolution will cover high quality grades of beef being shipped to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but will not cover the other 85 percent of beef trade which includes so-called `` variety meats'' such as livers, tongues and kidneys. Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said that the task force studying the situation will continue searching for ways to include more American beef and will report back before June 15. In a statement, Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> called the interim agreement a `` positive step'' toward de-escalating what had become a contentious dispute between <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and one of its largest trading partners. `` To the extent that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef and beef products are shipped to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> under this measure, we will reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliatory measures on imports from the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said that while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position remains the same that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> beef containing the hormones presents no health risk, the administration did not want to `` stand in the way of producers who are willing and able to meet the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>'s requirements'' for hormone-free beef. Under the agreement, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ranchers who want to export hormone-free beef to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will be given a set of requirements that they will have to meet by <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> officials, who will also establish a monitoring system to insure that the beef being shipped does not contain hormones.

<HEAD>Envoy Says U.S. Likely To Cut WHO Funding If PLO Joins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said Wednesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> probably will cut off funding to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> if it admits the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, and would do the same to any other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency that admits the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> told reporters the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> should withdraw or postpone its application to join the WHO when it meets in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> next week. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had been conducting a vigorous lobbying campaign against the membership. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has made known it is not prepared to fund WHO under these circumstances -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> membership -RRB- because the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is not, by legal definition, a state,'' <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> membership would harm the WHO and endanger the delicate peace process in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> by `` polarizing'' the situation. Last week, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would recommend to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that WHO funding be withdrawn if the organization admits the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> extended the threat to any other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency that might admit the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. No other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agencies have indicated they are considering admitting the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a member. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> donates one quarter of the annual WHO budget, or approximately $ 75 million. <PERSON> Zuhdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Labib </PERSON> <PERSON> Terzi </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s permanent <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer, said he had no immediate comment on <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>'s statement about other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agencies. Earlier, however, he said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would press ahead with efforts to join the WHO despite <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> threats. To be admitted to the 166-member WHO, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> needs a simple majority vote when the agency meets May 8. Admission would enhance the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s credibility and prestige in the international community. `` There is anguish that this is ill-timed,'' <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, a former ambassador to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, told reporters. `` This is a wrong and ill-conceived notion and it is time to try to find a formula or a way to postpone this.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not object if the <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION> established a group to study the question. Although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> decided last year to establish a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, it does not recognize the self-declared Palestinian state in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupied territories. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said that even some key <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states do not support <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> membership because the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> does not satisfy the traditional definition of statehood. He conceded that a halt to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funding could harm worthy WHO programs, like those on AIDS and nutrition. But he said there would be discussions on how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could continue to spend the funds effectively.

<TEXT>
 To the British public, <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Silcott </PERSON> is the leader of a mob that hacked a policeman to death in a north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> riot. But to some students at the world-renowned <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, his conviction and life sentence are an injustice. By making <PERSON> Silcott </PERSON> the honorary president of their student union, they have provoked a furious response from the government as well as fellow students. `` People who come here are supposed to be intelligent. If that is so, how can they elect this lunatic?'' asked <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasmir </PERSON>, a 20-year-old social sciences freshman, between classes at the central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> campus on Wednesday. `` It gives the college a bad name.'' In <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, Education Secretary <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> branded <PERSON> Silcott </PERSON>'s election `` shameful and despicable'' and told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>: `` This is the loony left hijacking a great institution.'' But <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronshaw </PERSON>, 23, a post-graduate in economics, said the union had achieved its aim: to refocus attention on the validity of the convictions of 49 young men after bloody rioting in the racially mixed <LOCATION> Tottenham </LOCATION> district on Oct. 16, 1985, in which a white policeman was killed. `` If we do believe in British standards of justice, the beyond-reasonable-doubt criterion, then if it is not seen to be applied by normal standards, there is grounds for a retrial,'' <PERSON> Cronshaw </PERSON> said. About 100 left-wing students elected 29-year-old <PERSON> Silcott </PERSON> to the one-year ceremonial term at the union's sparsely attended Annual General Meeting Thursday. A bigger turnout tried to reverse the decision at an angry meeting Tuesday but failed by 26 votes to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday it will hold a secret ballot of the college's 4,000 students. College governors pledged to review the college union's funding, while the school's <ORGANIZATION> Afro-Caribbean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> denounced the vote as `` deplorable, insensitive and patronizing to the black race.'' <PERSON> Silcott </PERSON> and another black, along with a Turkish teen-ager, were convicted of murdering <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakelock </PERSON> with machetes, and 43 out of 69 others were convicted and jailed for riot and affray. More than 500 youths fought battles with police in and around the Broadwater Farm housing project in the worst of a wave of racial unrest in British cities in the fall of 1985. It was the first riot to claim a policeman's life. <PERSON> Shaun </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON>, 24, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Broadwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>, says the hunt for the killers turned into `` basically a lucky dip, a lottery.'' `` The police needed scapegoats, they wanted revenge for the killing of one of their colleagues,'' he claimed in an interview. Civil libertarians have also cast doubt on the fairness of the trials. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the human rights group, investigated the case and concluded that the police forced many suspects to sign confessions and denied them full access to lawyers. It said confessions formed the basis of the prosecution evidence against nearly all defendants charged with felonies. While in custody, <PERSON> Silcott </PERSON> denied involvement in the killing and refused to answer most police questions. Police alleged that in his final interview, he told an officer, `` You ai n't got enough evidence. Those kids wo n't give evidence in court. No one will talk to you. You ca n't keep me away from them.'' <PERSON> Silcott </PERSON> denied using those words. <PERSON> Silcott </PERSON>'s defenders say police also presented conflicting testimony about his whereabouts during the riot. In 1987 a jury found <PERSON> Silcott </PERSON> guilty, and Judge Sir <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON> sentenced him to a minimum 30 years in prison, calling him `` a very evil and a very dangerous man.'' The judge disclosed that <PERSON> Silcott </PERSON> already was out on bail for another murder when the riot broke out. Lord <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON>, a civil rights campaigner and former judge, condemned the trials as `` a blot on the reputation of British justice.'' In a report, he concluded that `` the whole process from first to last was arbitrary, unfair and not conducive to bringing guilty people to justice.'' <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON> told students Tuesday that there was no evidence to convict <PERSON> Silcott </PERSON>. `` It was a terrible crime, and the more terrible a crime the greater is the emotion and the danger of prejudice, particularly racial prejudice.''

<HEAD>Dole Raises $1.2 Million To Benefit Disabled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> made a surprise visit Wednesday evening at a fund-raising event that collected some $ 1.2 million for a foundation headed by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> foundation assists the disabled and particularly promotes employment of the disabled. It is headed by the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator who was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s rival for the Republican presidential nomination last year. In brief remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised the organization's work and its help in `` mainstreaming'' the disadvantaged. He said the organization was `` a shining example for all of us,'' and called in `` one of the many thousands of points of light,'' a phrase he uses to refer to private activities that help make society better. The foundation also announced the awarding of $ 240,000 in grants for training and job programs for the disabled. The announcement came at the foundation's fourth annual $ 1,000-a-person reception. `` We have helped provide training and placement to over 2,200 people with disabilities in the past three years and we are just getting started,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said in a statement. The foundation honored the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for what <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> described as `` outstanding achievements in hiring people with disabilities at all levels throughout the company.'' The company employs more than 6,000 disabled people. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who lost most of the use of his right arm and hand because of wounds in World War II, established the non-profit, non-political foundation to provide money for training and job programs for the disabled. It began operating in 1984 and has provided grants totaling $ 2.7 million to more than 100 programs in 30 states.

 The man who was skipper of the tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> when it struck a reef and caused the nation's largest oil spill pleaded innocent Wednesday to criminal charges, including operating the vessel while drunk. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, 42, entered the plea through his attorney in a 15-minute proceeding before state Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, who was silent and declined to answer reporters' questions, was ushered out a back door of the courtroom immediately after the hearing. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, who was fired by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> after the accident, is charged with operating a vessel while drunk, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil, stemming from the March 24 incident which dumped more than 10 million gallons of crude into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. His attorney presented a $ 50,000 check for bail after <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> rejected a request to lower the amount to $ 25,000. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> scheduled the trial for June 20 in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, but one of <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s lawyers, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, said he would seek to transfer the trial to another area. `` There will undoubtedly be a change of venue -LRB- request -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> also said a grand jury has launched an investigation to determine whether additional charges should be filed against <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>. He did not elaborate. The state, meanwhile, was under pressure from the federal government to respond to <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s controversial plan for cleaning up oil-fouled seashore. State authorities reported increasing damage on the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and at Katmai National Park. `` It's a very thick mousse-type stuff six to eight inches thick'' hitting in blotches, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamoreaux </PERSON>, a state environmental official. `` It's definitely a difficult type of clean-up operation. It's close to shore and rolling up on shore.'' <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> was to inspect the spill zone, and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> scheduled a visit Thursday on his return from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. After the spill, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> went home to <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, where he was arrested on a fugitive warrant, but he returned voluntarily Wednesday and surrendered, not even waiting for an extradition hearing. He had been free on $ 25,000 bail in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and a prosecutor said Wednesday he would move to dismiss the fugitive charge and return the bail money. On the night of the spill, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> allegedly turned over control of the 987-foot-long <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> to an uncertified mate. The tanker was outside shipping lanes when it rammed a reef and ripped its bottom, letting the <ORGANIZATION> Alaskan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Slope </ORGANIZATION> crude oil pour out. Authorities say <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, who has a history of alcohol-related driving arrests in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, had a blood-alcohol level of 0.061 percent nine hours after the crash. The legal maritime limit for operating a vessel is 0.04 percent. State environmental officials, facing a deadline ordered by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s personal emissary to the oil spill, worked to decide whether to accept <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to remove the crude from hundreds of miles of shoreline. Key state scientists and the head of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> have sharply criticized the oil company's proposal, which would leave nearly 200 miles of oily coastline uncleansed and require exemptions from strict environmental laws to dispose of the sludge and wastewater. <PERSON> Lamoreaux </PERSON> described the plan Wednesday as `` more like a briefing document for the press than a plan for us.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s environmental conservation commissioner, called <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s cleanup and disposal plan `` a few pages of wishful thinking.'' A statement issued by <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>'s office said state authorities would `` insist that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> focus all its energies and equipment on cleaning all the affected beaches, no matter how hard hit.'' Admiral <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, ordered state authorities to issue a formal response to <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s plan. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> must approve the proposal before it is put into effect and said he would do so within a week. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> also has criticized the proposal, saying it was poorly drafted and lacked specifics, but he stopped short of formally rejecting it. In an interview Wednesday on `` CBS This Morning,'' Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said the state may be willing to waive some environmental restrictions for disposal of the oil if `` that's the only practical way to get rid of it and it does n't really cause anything but temporary changes in the air quality, we might well consider that.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has proposed several methods to dispose of oil wastes. Salvageable oil would be processed and refined. Oil-laced water would be sent to a Valdez water-treatment plant that cleans ballast water from oil tankers. Solid oil wastes would be burned or buried.

 The Central Park beating and rape of a 28-year-old investment banker grabbed headlines two weeks ago and has n't let go, provoking debates about how racism, sexism and class division may have led to the attack and influenced the coverage. From <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, where the teen-age suspects lived, to <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, where the victim worked, the questions continue: Did the black and Hispanic youths attack her because she is white? Is the story played up because of the black-white angle? Would the rape of a black investment banker get the same attention? `` The only reason for all this -LRB- publicity -RRB- is because she's white,'' said a black girl from an East Harlem junior high that two of the suspects attended `` If she was a black girl or a Hispanic girl, nobody would care, and that happens all the time.'' `` I do n't think the incident itself was racial,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Daughtry </PERSON>, a civil rights activist, `` but I think the way that we _ the media, the police, all of us _ have reacted is racial.'' Whether racism motivated the attackers is something that may not be known until the trials of the six indicted youths, if then. `` We have never classified it as a bias case or a racially motivated incident,'' said <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. Meanwhile, the victim has emerged from her two-week coma, spoken to relatives and expressed a desire to resume running, doctors said Wednesday. The woman began responding Tuesday and had spoken in a whisper to relatives and staff members, raised two fingers when asked to do so and was able to read large signs printed with yes, no and her name, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>, assistant chief of surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, chief of neurosurgery. However, <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> said, `` We would still say ... she is in a delirium. People in this stage will fluctuate.'' He has said it is unlikely she will ever fully recover. The teen-agers who went `` wilding'' through the park April 19 attacked nine white and Hispanic joggers, bicyclists and one homeless man. What turned the spree of petty crime into brutal violence remains a mystery, though many have theories. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, a black psychologist, said crossing that line was made easier because violence is commonplace in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> and made mundane by repetitive violent images in the media. The generally degrading image of women in movies, television and pornography, she said, serves as an anesthetic that would deaden the sense of revulsion most people would feel toward such violence. `` They had fantasies in their minds _ of being like those on television, the ones who shoot people, who are powerful, in control, macho, aggressive, strong,'' she said. Also contributing, some say, is the contrast between the poorer sections of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and the wealthier ones, which coexist nearly side-by-side along the upper reaches of Central Park. `` From where these kids live, in five minutes walking you're in the gold coast, people are millionaires,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Diller </PERSON>, a lawyer for one of the suspects. `` Was there any resentment, jealousy, hate, anger that was involved?'' <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Borough President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, a black who is running for mayor, met with more than 100 community, religious and political leaders Friday to deal with lingering tensions. `` I want to avoid a situation wherein any young African-American, any young <PERSON> Latino </PERSON> will be seen as threatening by others who happen to be white,'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> called the attackers `` urban terrorists,'' but noted, `` African-American women who have been savaged did not get the attention that this has.'' <PERSON> Diller </PERSON>, who has discussed the case on national television and radio programs, said the victim's `` very upwardly mobile'' career gives the story added interest for those who might otherwise ignore a rape. <ORGANIZATION> WCBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> assistant news director <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulus </PERSON> said he believed the crime initially drew attention because it occurred in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where people are warned not to go after dark. `` The morning we came in, we did n't know the victim was an investment banker,'' he said. `` We did n't know she was a yuppie.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Forst </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> editor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newsday </LOCATION>, said there were newsroom discussions about the amount of attention given the attack, but he believed it was `` appropriate to the event.'' <ORGANIZATION> WNBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he thought, `` if you keep all the other circumstances the same and change the race of the victim,'' the coverage would have been `` pretty much the same.'' `` Yes, there are assaults all the time, rapes all the time, but something with this degree of viciousness, involving this many young kids, allegedly, it leads you to wonder what's happening to your society,'' he said. `` It's the kind of story that has an entire city talking,'' said Daily News Managing Editor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Willse </PERSON>. `` The conflict is one of culture, class, more than it is of race.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Darnton </PERSON>, metropolitan editor of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, was out of the office Wednesday, and a spokeswoman did not return two phone messages. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> editor <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Amsterdam </PERSON> and metropolitan editor <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Belsky </PERSON> also were not immediately available. On Monday, there was a gathering in the park at which children tried to do some repair work on their image. `` The media builds it up that all black and Hispanic kids commit these horrible crimes,'' said 12-year-old <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>. `` We know we are not like this, thank you.''

 Pravda reported Wednesday that police arrested about half of a mob of about 200 young people who attacked stores, restaurants and parks in the republic of <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION> in Central <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> after May Day celebrations. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper charged that the crowd in <LOCATION> Ashkabad </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION>, was led by criminals and said it was broken up by force on Monday evening after ignoring calls by police to disperse. `` Not less than 100 lawbreakers were detained, and no one was hurt,'' Pravda said. The newspaper said, `` Those who were detained said they acted because of exorbitant prices of cooperatives and the low quality of products and services. But as a method of protest, as was seen, they chose hooliganism.'' It said the rioters broke windows and damaged cars. Pravda quoted Interior Minister <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION> as saying police managed to break up the rampage without using tear gas or truncheons. This apparently was intended to assure readers that no repeat had occurred of the clash between soldiers and pro-independence demonstrators in the Georgian republic on April 9. Nineteen people were killed then and a 20th victim was fatally shot later for violating a curfew. <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION> is a southern Soviet republic of 3.5 million people that borders the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. It was the first such report of trouble in <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION>, but religious and civil unrest were reported previously in the other traditionally Moslem Central Asian republics of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. Cooperatives are small, privately owned businesses allowed under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reforms to provide goods and services the state-run economy can not. Many Soviets view the cooperatives with suspicion.

 Spending on education is up but progress is at a standstill, Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said Wednesday in releasing a report card that rates the nation's students as `` merely average.'' `` The good news is that the schools are not worse; the bad news is that we are not making progress,'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said as he stood before his department's sixth annual State Education Performance Chart. `` We are standing still, and the problem is that it's been this way for three years in a row. Frankly, the situation scares me,'' he said. The figures show a decline this year in the national high school graduation rate and falling scores on college entrance exams in half the states. In reaction, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Officers, while acknowledging that `` the task ahead is gigantic,'' noted that 44 of the 50 states have made college entrance test gains since 1982 and 38 states have improved their high school completion rates since then. But <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> called the longer-term gains minimal. He said `` scores on college entrance exams are still substantially lower than they were in the 1960s'' while the graduation rate has gone up less than two points. `` As a nation our educational performance is merely average,'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said. `` People are still willing, apparently, to accept that we're not doing well and ca n't compete.'' If educational progress has stagnated, the Education Department's chart shows the same can not be said of per-pupil spending. The national average was $ 3,977 per student in 1987, up from $ 3,165 in 1982, calculated in constant dollars _ a 26 percent hike. `` We are already spending more money per student than our major foreign competitors, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. And yet our students consistently fall behind the competition in competitive testing,'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said. `` Money alone is not the answer to our education deficit.'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said he would write to state school chiefs, governors and school board presidents and urge them to adopt specific goals such as boosting high school graduation rates to 90 percent and cutting in half the number of children who fail a grade. He said states and districts should issue annual reports on their progress toward such goals. Specifically, the department's chart shows that national scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test -LRB- SAT -RRB- fell from an average of 906 to 904 -LRB- on a scale of 400 to 1,600 -RRB- from 1987 to 1988. Fourteen of the 22 states in which the SAT is the dominant college entrance exam registered declines. Scores on the American College Testing Program -LRB- ACT -RRB-, marked on a scale of 1 to 36, showed a scant 0.1-point gain. And 11 of the 28 states in which the ACT dominates posted decreases. The high school graduation rate rose from 69.5 percent in 1982 to 71.7 percent in 1985. But it edged down in 1986 to 71.6 percent and dropped to 71.1 percent in 1987, the latest year for which such statistics could be calculated. Department officials noted several encouraging trends: Minority students are continuing to lift their test scores, close a high school `` graduation gap'' and in increasing numbers take the Advanced Placement test that qualifies students for college credit. In addition, states with relatively high poverty rates such as <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> have registered some of the largest increases in college entrance test scores since 1982, though they still rank at the bottom of the heap. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>' generally dismal assessment comes amid a spate of reform efforts in the past few years. Asked if the reform movement has failed, he replied that `` some of it has lost its momentum'' or failed to achieve its goals. He said fundamental restructuring _ which he defined as parental freedom to choose public schools, provision of alternate ways to become a teacher and more parental involvement in education _ has yet to occur. `` We have some examples but we do n't have a lot of them out there,'' he said. In a telephone interview, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> schools superintendent <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> of misrepresenting data, ignoring progress and flinging cold water on educators who have been able to improve their students' performance. `` We've got statistics showing that achievement test scores are going up substantially in the country,'' <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> said, calling them a better indicator than college entrance tests because they include average students as well as the college-bound. <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> also said SAT scores are flat because so many more students are taking the test. He said there has actually been a substantial improvement in the percentage of seniors scoring higher than 450 on the verbal section and 500 on the math section _ a 20 percent increase since 1982. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying it agreed that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> schools are stagnating. But the teacher union said <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> is wrong to minimize money as a factor for improvement, and it attributed the stagnation problem to federal cutbacks in programs for the disadvantaged. `` What we are seeing now is the direct result of the educational neglect supported by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>.

It has undergone a string of military coups since the first in 1966. The last civilian government under President <PERSON> Shehu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shagari </PERSON> was overthrown by the army on Dec. 31, 1983, when partisan politics were banned. Under a transition program announced Wednesday night, some civilian leaders will be elected in local council polls in December.

 A man accused of killing his two sons by locking them into a searing foundry ladle was a mentally ill religious zealot who spoke of `` trial by fire,'' his attorney said Wednesday. <PERSON> Bartley </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobbens </PERSON>, 28, is on trial in circuit court on two counts of murder in the Thanksgiving Day 1987 deaths of 2-year-old <PERSON> Bartley </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> and 15-month-old <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> in nearby <LOCATION> Norton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION>. The defendant, who has been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, wept during opening arguments when his wife and children were mentioned. <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON>'s pregnant wife was waiting for him in their car when he took the boys into the <ORGANIZATION> Cannon-Muskegon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> foundry to retrieve a Bible and show them where he worked. In his opening argument, defense attorney <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> told jurors he would show <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> was legally insane at the time. Assistant <LOCATION> Muskegon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said the evidence would show <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> planned his children's deaths because of jealousy and `` a bad marriage that existed from the start.'' <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> stopped taking psychiatric medication and filed for divorce within two weeks of meeting self-ordained minister <PERSON> Rood </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> in March 1987. `` Within two weeks, <PERSON> Bartley </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON>'s life turned upside down,'' the attorney said. <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> began taking his children to hear fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sermons by <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> in the basement of <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>'s home, and sometimes kept the children out all night, <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said. On the day of the slaying, <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> visited a friend at 1 a.m. and talked for hours, quoting from the Bible and speaking of `` trial by fire ... and only fire burns sins away,'' <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> thought he was performing `` a spiritual rite'' when he took his children to the foundry, put them in a furnace, `` played with them to make them comfortable,'' lit the gas jets, and set them at 1,300 degrees, <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said. The attorney said <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON>'s schizophrenia first appeared in high school, when he appeared to undergo a `` Jekyll and <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> transition'' and became obsessed with religion. After marrying, <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> became insanely jealous and later became obsessed with the idea his children would be killed, <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said. In 1985, <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> had psychotic episodes so intense he was committed to a psychiatric hospital, and endured co-workers' taunts after his release, <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> is charged with open counts of murder, meaning the jury sets the degree. If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison. The trial is expected to last two to four weeks.

<HEAD>Chile's Military Government Scraps Plans For Democratic Reforms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The right-wing military government said Wednesday it was scrapping plans for democratic reforms because the opposition rejected a take-it-or-leave-it proposal. Interior Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> blamed `` intransigent'' opposition leaders in announcing an end to further talks. He said the opposition `` closed out the possibility of a realistic agreement'' on amendments to the 1980 constitution. `` Under the current circumstances, there is no possibility whatsoever of talking again about constitutional changes,'' he told a news conference. Among reform proposals abandoned was one legalizing Marxism. The announcement indicated an abrupt hardening in the position of President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s government and a return to an openly antagonistic relationship between authorities and opposition. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, president of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a leader of a 17-party opposition coalition, told his own news conference later that the move means reforms will have to wait until after Dec. 14 elections. `` If the government has said it will make no changes at all, there will be no changes for the time being,'' he said. `` They will have to be done by the future congress and the future government to be elected in December.'' <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> is considered the coalition's most likely choice as presidential candidate. The government on Friday proposed 19 changes to the constitution, including several offered in response to pressures for reform after Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> lost a referendum last October on extending his rule to 1997. Some changes deemed essential by the opposition were left out, however. The referendum loss obliged <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to schedule the elections, and his foes say reforms are needed to make sure the new government has full democratic powers. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> is legally barred from being a candidate. The government package would have required approval by two successive senates before the reforms took effect _ a delay of at least five years. The opposition coalition rejected it on Tuesday night as `` a step backward.'' It wanted the reforms to take effect before the elections, the first since <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> seized power in a violent 1973 coup. The government proposal met an opposition call for amending a constitutional article that outlaws all propagation of Marxist thought, by individuals or groups. It would retain a ban on political groups that promote violence or totalitarianism. It also allowed for a one-time shortening of the presidential term to four years instead of the normal eight years. The opposition wanted the shorter term for the next government, which it sees as a transition leadership. But the government refused to meet an opposition demand that the entire senate be elected. According to the constitution, 10 members of the <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION>'s 36 members will be appointed. It also rejected opposition calls for erasing a clause that allows <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to remain as army commander for eight more years. The same clause applies to the heads of the navy, air force and national police. The 73-year-old <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> recently vowed to stay on as army commander and said the military would keep a role as political overseers to ensure the country does not fall under leftist control.

 Newly elected parliament members from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> decided Wednesday it would be frivolous to nominate anyone but <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for president of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a participant in the meeting said. `` We decided the president must be <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and we will not put forward an alternative,'' said <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Bocharov </PERSON>, who was elected from the Butovo district on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s outskirts. <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravchenko </PERSON>, director of the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, said last week in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> deputies planned to nominate a candidate to compete with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for the presidenccy, but <PERSON> Bocharov </PERSON> said it was a `` silly'' idea. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who has been <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief since March 1985, was elected president unanimously in October by the Supreme Soviet, replacing <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>. Political reforms since then change the way the president is chosen and expand the powers of the office. The new 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies will convene May 25 to elect the president and choose a 542-member working parliament from among its own members. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> addressed Wednesday's meeting of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> members, but it did not report what he said. <PERSON> Bocharov </PERSON> said the Soviet leader answered questions put by some of the 70 to 80 representatives present. Others attending included <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief; Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, and party ideologist <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Bocharov </PERSON>, who runs a building materials factory, said the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> group would meet again May 15 to chose candidates for the working parliament. In another political development, Soviet political activists said they had formed a branch of the Rome-based <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubchenko </PERSON>, spokesman for the newly formed 70-member <ORGANIZATION> Transnational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the group would campaign for the elimination of nuclear weapons, more political freedom and protection of the environment. <PERSON> Rubchenko </PERSON>, a political activist, said the new group also was seeking more economic ties with <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the lifting of customs barriers and acceptance of a common European system of laws. Soviet law prohibits any political party except the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and the effort to register as an affiliate of the Italian party apparently was designed to get around that prohibition.

 Snipping a royal blue ribbon, Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> on Wednesday formally opened his country's new, $ 76 million embassy near the foot of <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and declared that `` the maple leaf comes to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, who arrived for talks Thursday with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> paid tribute to the close ties between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, symbolized by the unique location of the new chancery building. It is the only foreign embassy situated on <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, the ceremonial route lining the Capitol and the White House. The modernistic building, designed by <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> architect <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON>, occupies a prized, 1.2-acre site opposite the National Gallery of Art. A smiling <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> held the ribbon draped across the main entrance to the building while <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> clipped it with a pair of scissors before a crowd of dignitaries that included leading members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the new embassy `` conveys the warmth and openness of the people of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'' and reflects enduring bonds of friendship between the two countries. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> declared the embassy `` open in the service of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and in service of the friendship of our great ally, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Together, they visited Ambassador <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Burney </PERSON>'s glassed-in penthouse office suite on the sixth floor to admire the view of the Mall and the Capitol. The embassy staff of 327 people moved into the building a month ago from their previous quarters in two buildings on <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, the city's traditional `` embassy row,'' and rented space in a downtown office building. <PERSON> Burney </PERSON>, who arrived shortly before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was inaugurated Jan. 20, will continue to reside in an elegant, six-story mansion on <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> where <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s envoys had maintained their offices since 1928. The new embassy building, finished in <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> limestone with unpolished aluminum pillars, was completed in March, a year behind schedule, at a cost of $ 76 million, nearly double the original estimate. The courtyard outside the main entrance features a pool, terraced greenery and a fountain under a rotunda circled by 12 columns, one for each of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s 10 provinces and two territories. Inside are a 20,000-volume library, a 175-seat theater, a small exercise room and an art gallery.

<TEXT>
 More than 100,000 opposition backers packed one of the capital's main streets Wednesday to hear candidates predict victory in next week's elections and an end to 21 years of military control. Presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, his voice hoarse, told the crowd <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was on the eve of `` a new republic of which you all will be founding fathers.'' `` I was born free. I am not free. I will be free on May 7,'' shouted <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, the opposition's candidate for the second of two vice-presidential seats in Sunday's balloting. The speeches were interrupted when crowds panicked, once when security guards stopped people from coming too near the candidates and again when an alleged government infiltrator, or `` toad,'' was chased from the area by a mob beating him with sticks. People in the crowd said they saw an unidentified man fire gunshots into the air at one point. Several people were knocked to the ground. Some fainted and were carried away, but no serious injuries were reported. A group of youths snake-danced through the crowd carrying a black coffin with the picture of a smiling Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> pasted on the front and a pineapple affixed on top. `` Pineapple face'' is a derogatory name for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, inspired by his rough complexion. First vice-presidential candidate <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> praised young Panamanians at the rally, saying, `` There are thousands here who have never known liberty but are here to fight for it.'' The chanting, flag-waving crowd was packed so tightly on <LOCATION> Via </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espana </LOCATION> that at times it was impossible to move. The opposition has accused the government of trying to rig Sunday's election. Earlier Wednesday, opposition leaders warned that Panamanians may react with violence if fraud is evident. `` This is the last peaceful opportunity for change,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> told a news conference earlier in the day. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> also attended the conference. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said the opposition wants to avoid a confrontation with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, but `` we fear that if the will of the people is violated, there will be a spontaneous reaction.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto ruler, is backing his business associate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaen </PERSON>, for president. The government also has warned that the elections could turn violent. <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> has urged his followers `` to take to the streets ... to defend the vote.'' The government made a public show of handing out weapons April 30 to the `` Dignity Batallions,'' civilians trained to defend <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> against a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said official voter rolls show duplicated names and suspicious increases in the number of voters. He said the registration in some districts doubled. He alleged the number of registered voters on rolls has grown 29 percent since 1984, while the population has increased by only 16 percent. Government officials explained the increases by saying registration procedures have improved. Despite the predictions of fraud, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said he was confident the opposition's `` margin of victory will be such that it will neutralize the fraud, if the fraud is not accompanied by crude forms of repression.'' The opposition candidates said there is no hope of democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as long as <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who was indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year on charges of drug smuggling and money laundering, remains in power. After his indictment, then-President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in turn ousted <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and the government accuse the opposition of being lackies of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has imposed economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as part of its attempt to drive him from power. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denies the drug smuggling and money laundering allegations and says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to get rid of him as part of a plan to retain control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. According to a 1977 treaty, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to turn the waterway over to local control in the year 2000 and remove its 12,000 military personnel from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Among the observers expected for Sunday's voting are former presidents <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who signed the treaty, and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. They are part of an unofficial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation invited by the Panamanian government. The government has rejected any official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation.

<TEXT>
 A red wolf, the second rarest mammal in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, gave birth to three puppies Wednesday at a wildlife center. If the puppies survive, they will be the first Texas-born red wolves since the mid-1970s, raising the total population to 92, said officials at Fossil Rim Wildlife Center. In 1973, after the passage of the Endangered Species Act, the entire red wolf population in southeast <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> was captured to prevent its extinction. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> captured about 40 red wolves and began a recovery program in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. The black-footed ferret is the only mammal that is rarer than the red wolf in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Fossil Rim, a research and education center that is involved in the propagation of eight endangered species, received four red wolf breeding pair in February. `` We are sure a second female will produce a litter within the next week to 10 days,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumer </PERSON>, a Fossil Rim veterinarian. The puppies were estimated to weigh about 14 ounces, but Fossil Rim officials said they would not be sexed or examined until Thursday or Friday. The red wolf is smaller than the gray wolf, with females weighing 40-60 pounds and males weighing 60-80 pounds. The wolf ranged from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> east to the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast and north to the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> valley </LOCATION>, but began disappearing because of their inability to adapt to changes in the land and predator control.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Warring factions agreed Wednesday to implement a cease-fire plan to end the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> bloodbath that has killed 278 people in eight weeks, an Arab League peacemaker announced. `` There is no justification for a single shot to be fired in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as of now,'' Algerian diplomat <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> told reporters after meeting separately with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s rival <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> leaders _ Sunni Moslem <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> and Christian Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. Several hours after <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON>'s announcement, however, police reported a new violation of the truce. As speedboats began ferrying passengers from the harbor of the Christian port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> to the Cypriot-flagged ferry Baroness M, anchored 15 miles off the coast, three shells fired from Syrian-policed west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> crashed on the <LOCATION> Byblos </LOCATION> coast nine miles north of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, police said. They said the captain of the Baroness M refused to enter the port, 12 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, because he was skeptical about guarantees that his vessel would not be shelled. A police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity according to regulations, said the violation did not interrupt the transport of about 500 passengers onto the Baroness M to be ferried to the <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>. The ship and another boat, the <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rose </LOCATION>, had evacuated about 15,000 people from the Christian enclave during the fighting. But both suspended the shuttles April 24 after they became the target of Syrian and Druse Moslem gunners. Earlier, police reported some sniper fire from Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> into the Christian sector. But a spokesman played down the violation and said, `` It seems the cease-fire orders have n't been issued yet.'' No casualties were reported. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 Lebanese army soldiers have battled Moslem militiamen and allied Syrian soldiers since March 3. More than 1,000 people have been injured in that time. Ibrahimi and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abdel-Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON>, arrived in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> earlier Wednesday seeking to enforce an Arab League-brokered truce that began April 28. It scaled down indiscriminate bombardment of population centers in and around <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. But it was violated repeatedly after three days because <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> rejected the second clause of the accord, refusing to lift a blockade of three illegal militia-run ports. The blockade, through which <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> wanted to restore government authority and gather taxes worth $ 100 million a year, ignited the latest fighting. Druse and Syrian gunners, who outnumber <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces by 3-1, retaliated by firing at <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> ports, then besieged the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> heartland and trapped some 1 million Christians in a 310-square-mile enclave. <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> now has `` accepted to implement the decision adopted by the Arab foreign ministers which calls for lifting all blockades imposed on all air and sea ports.'' <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport, the country's only international air transport facility, was closed by Christian shellfire March 12. <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> also agreed to reopen road crossings that link <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem and Christian sectors for three months while the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> brokers a comprehensive settlement. `` I can say the cease-fire has taken effect today after the settlement of the ports dispute. The observer force will begin arriving soon,'' <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> said, but did not give a date. An aide to <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> proposed deploying Arab observers at the disputed ports, where <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has charged militias also run guns and drugs. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> agreed to the envoy's compromise. Kuwaiti Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> panel on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, stressed Wednesday that the observers will be sent only after the cease-fire is consolidated. `` We are not prepared to sacrifice any Arab brethren in the continued shelling and exchange of fire,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has welcomed the deployment of an Arab observer team, saying it also would monitor the 40,000 Syrian soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, whom Christians accuse of breaking a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate by siding with the Moslems. The observers' presence is expected to loosen <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s grip as <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s sole powerbroker.

<TEXT>
 An African rebel leader urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Wednesday to help end the protracted war between the strategically placed province of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and the Soviet-backed government of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Isaias </PERSON> <PERSON> Afwerki </PERSON>, Secretary General of the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said he hoped to convey his views to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and lawmakers, although he declined to say whom he would be meeting <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, who said <PERSON> Afwerki </PERSON> is the most senior Eritrean rebel leader ever to visit here, also declined to say whether they would meet with him. <PERSON> Afwerki </PERSON> said he did not have any specific initiatives to offer, but hoped the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would `` contribute to a lasting solution'' for the conflict by helping bring the sides to the negotiating table. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy rejects <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>'s demands for secession from <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, advocating negotiations between the sides to end what has become, at 27 years, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s longest war. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have occasionally met with members of the <ORGANIZATION> EPLF </ORGANIZATION>, the largest of several Eritrean groups. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> also maintains ties with the government of Ethiopian Military Chairman <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON>, although relations have deteriorated since <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> switched allegiance to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1977. <PERSON> Afwerki </PERSON>'s visit comes at a time when <LOCATION> Mengistu </LOCATION>, suffering economic woes and military defeats to the rebels, is also making overtures to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration. `` <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s prospects are bleaker than ever,'' <PERSON> Afwerki </PERSON> contended at a seminar sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, an independent think tank. The <ORGANIZATION> EPLF </ORGANIZATION>, which is backed by several <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments but relies mostly on captured <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> weaponry, has claimed significant military victories over the past year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe the organization controls about 75 percent of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, which overlooks a key water route to the oil fields of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, but that the government retains control of the province's major ports and cities. Officials here say the government is also under pressure from its main arms supplier, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, to end the costly war. <PERSON> Afwerki </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, despite claims to the contrary, continues to arm the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> government. Nonetheless, the <ORGANIZATION> EPLF </ORGANIZATION> is `` among the first who hope to benefit'' from recent cooperation between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in resolving regional conflicts around the world. <PERSON> Afwerki </PERSON> said such superpower cooperation, as evidenced by agreements ending the Soviet occupation of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> occupation of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, has made his organization optimistic about prospects for negotiations with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EPLF </ORGANIZATION> is still holding out for its 1980 proposal to conduct a referendum that would determine whether <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> remains an autonomous part of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> or secedes from it altogether, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> EPLF </ORGANIZATION> has in the past proposed third-country mediation to end the war with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> but has spurned proposals for <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> to bring the sides together. <PERSON> Afwerki </PERSON> rejected claims that his group is Marxist in nature, calling that a pretext for past `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indifference,'' and said the <ORGANIZATION> EPLF </ORGANIZATION> represented varying economic views and was committed to a free economy.

Shooting back was Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel, who said <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> apparently `` does n't believe senators can handle a public given-and-take with Soviet officials. `` I'm fully confident in the intellectual and political skills of the members of my committee,'' he said. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> announced Monday that his panel would hold hearings with Marshal <PERSON> Sergey </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, former chief of the Soviet general staff and now an adviser to <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, sometime in June. In addition, the committee's <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panel </ORGANIZATION> will hold a hearing May 9 with Soviet officials from the Institute for the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> think tank on superpower relations. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said putting together a defense budget `` will be hard enough to do given the deficit. But the problem is compounded by uncertainty about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' The chairman pointed out that only the executive branch can negotiate agreements with the Soviets, but a committee `` is in a better position for expansive given-and-take and exploration of new ideas.'' That raised the ire of <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, who wondered why <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does n't invite <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> `` to give us expert testimony on stopping terrorism. `` <LOCATION> Gorbymania </LOCATION> has struck with a vengenance in the halls of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. We have initiated our own phrase to mimic the Soviets _ ` parrotstroika,''' <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> senator also said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should not be a forum for Soviet propaganda. In response, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said that if <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> `` fears that hearing what the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION> have to say _ and putting them through a grilling on what they have n't talked about publicly _ amounts to making ` the committee process a forum for Soviet propaganda,' I feel sorry for him.'' <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, in a telephone interview late Wednesday, said he did n't `` need help from Soviet military planners Les believes the Soviets are here to be grilled. I expect him to be keenly disappointed.'' Asked if the criticisms would result in any bad feelings, <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> said, `` No. Les and I are good friends. We've worked together for a long time. This is not the first time and it wo n't be the last.''

<TEXT>
 An African rebel leader urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Wednesday to help end the protracted war between the strategically placed province of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and the Soviet-backed government of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Isaias </PERSON> <PERSON> Afwerki </PERSON>, Secretary General of the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said he hoped to convey his views to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and lawmakers, although he declined to say whom he would be meeting <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, who said <PERSON> Afwerki </PERSON> is the most senior Eritrean rebel leader ever to visit here, also declined to say whether they would meet with him. <PERSON> Afwerki </PERSON> said he did not have any specific initiatives to offer, but hoped the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would `` contribute to a lasting solution'' for the conflict by helping bring the sides to the negotiating table. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy rejects <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>'s demands for secession from <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, advocating negotiations between the sides to end what has become, at 27 years, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s longest war. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have occasionally met with members of the <ORGANIZATION> EPLF </ORGANIZATION>, the largest of several Eritrean groups. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> also maintains ties with the government of Ethiopian Military Chairman <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON>, although relations have deteriorated since <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> switched allegiance to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1977. <PERSON> Afwerki </PERSON>'s visit comes at a time when <LOCATION> Mengistu </LOCATION>, suffering economic woes and military defeats to the rebels, is also making overtures to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration. `` <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s prospects are bleaker than ever,'' <PERSON> Afwerki </PERSON> contended at a seminar sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, an independent think tank. The <ORGANIZATION> EPLF </ORGANIZATION>, which is backed by several <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments but relies mostly on captured <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> weaponry, has claimed significant military victories over the past year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe the organization controls about 75 percent of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, which overlooks a key water route to the oil fields of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, but that the government retains control of the province's major ports and cities. Officials here say the government is also under pressure from its main arms supplier, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, to end the costly war. <PERSON> Afwerki </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, despite claims to the contrary, continues to arm the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> government. Nonetheless, the <ORGANIZATION> EPLF </ORGANIZATION> is `` among the first who hope to benefit'' from recent cooperation between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in resolving regional conflicts around the world. <PERSON> Afwerki </PERSON> said such superpower cooperation, as evidenced by agreements ending the Soviet occupation of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> occupation of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, has made his organization optimistic about prospects for negotiations with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EPLF </ORGANIZATION> is still holding out for its 1980 proposal to conduct a referendum that would determine whether <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> remains an autonomous part of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> or secedes from it altogether, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> EPLF </ORGANIZATION> has in the past proposed third-country mediation to end the war with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> but has spurned proposals for <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> to bring the sides together. <PERSON> Afwerki </PERSON> rejected claims that his group is Marxist in nature, calling that a pretext for past `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indifference,'' and said the <ORGANIZATION> EPLF </ORGANIZATION> represented varying economic views and was committed to a free economy.

 <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Hocine </PERSON>, rector of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mosque </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and considered the top Moslem religious authority in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, died Wednesday night after suffering a heart attack, officials said. He was 77. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> was evacuated by helicopter Wednesday evening from the <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crillon </ORGANIZATION>, where visiting <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is staying, to the <PERSON> Val </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> military hospital after the heart attack. A statement issued by the mosque said <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> died at 10:30 p.m., shortly after being admitted to the hospital. It said the rector's body would be returned to his homeland, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, on Friday. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> was made rector of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> mosque in 1982. He often acted as a spokesman for French Moslems, a role disputed by some, and as a liaison between the French government and the Moslem community. As many as 3 million Moslems live in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, making it the nation's second religion after Roman Catholicism. It was not immediately known whether <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> had met with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> at the Crillon. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chairman was attending a dinner given by Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> at the close of a two-day official visit. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, with his tinted spectacles and astrakhan hat, was a well-known figure to the French media, appearing in occasional television interviews and commenting on political developments affecting the Moslem community. He became for many a soothing and fatherly symbol of a moderate Islam. At the height of the scandal of <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s `` The Satanic Verses,'' <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> advised the French not to pay so much attention to this `` disrespectful writer.'' Iranian leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> issued a death sentence on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, saying he had blasphemed Islam in his book. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> neither spoke nor understood French when he succeeded <PERSON> Si </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamza </PERSON> <PERSON> Boubakeur </PERSON>, who for years was a powerful but controversial figure at the head of the mosque in the Latin Quarter on the <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. From a notable religious family near Constantine, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> was educated in North African centers of Islamic learning such as <LOCATION> Kerouan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Fez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. He worked for religious reform in French colonial <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> to help return the North African land to its Arab and Islamic character. Following Algerian independence, he spent four years as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. As rector of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Mosque, his human qualities soon won him respect from Algerian Moslems, who make up the largest part of the French Moslem community. He took to opening the doors of the mosque in winter to provide shelter for the homeless. The mosque, inaugurated in 1926, is the largest place of Moslem worship in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Misdemeanor Charges Filed Against 9 Companies In L.A. High-rise Fire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A year after fire gutted 4 -LCB- floors of the 62-story <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> tower and killed a worker, prosecutors filed 12 misdemeanor charges against nine companies Wednesday in connection with the blaze. Two counts of the complaint filed by the district attorney and city attorney referred to the death of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Handy </PERSON>, 24, a maintenance man who died May 4, 1988, after riding an elevator to the 12th floor, where the fire started, to investigate an alarm. Forty other people suffered smoke inhalation in the city's worst high-rise fire, which caused more than $ 450 million in damage. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthman </PERSON> said there is a three-year statute of limitations on filing felony charges. The decision to file misdemeanor charges, he said, was prompted by the misdemeanor statute of limitations which runs out Friday. If convicted, the defendants face various fines ranging from $ 1,000 on municipal violations to $ 10,000 on state labor code violations Among those charged in the complaint were <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pedus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which was in charge of security. The corporations charged in the misdemeanor complaint included those owning part of the building or those involved in its security and maintenance. The charges alleged seven violations of the state Labor Code and five of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Municipal Code, including blocking a fire exit, failing to maintain fire equipment and failing to maintain an accident protection program. The charges also allege failure to call in an alarm and failure to notify the Fire Department of inoperative equipment. Others charged with violations were <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maintenance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maintenance </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION>. Cosco was installing fire sprinklers at the time of the fire, and was charged in connection with the closing of water mains in the building. During the blaze a ring of flame roiled around the 12th through 15th floors for nearly four hours, showering streets with glass and flaming debris and chasing people to the roof where 10 were plucked to safety by helicopters. Others fled down smoky stairwells. Thirty-seven maintenance workers and three firemen were treated for smoke inhalation. The cause of the conflagration was never determined because the 2,000-degree fire destroyed clues, but investigators eliminated arson as a possibility. The 859-foot-tall building had no sprinkler system because it was built in 1973, a year before fire codes were modified to require sprinklers. The 62-story tower was the tallest in the city at the time of the fire.

 A woman who sued a hospital after she contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion has died from complications of the disease. <PERSON> Edwina </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, 48, died at her family home last Thursday. She filed suit against <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> in December 1983 after becoming infected with the virus through unscreened blood. Officials later discovered the blood had been donated by a known heroin addict who died two months after <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> received the transfusion. At least three other people have died from the same blood, said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s lawsuit alleges gross negligence and seeks $ 1.5 million in damages. The hospital had fought to keep the case from going to trial, arguing it should be decided through arbitration. In September 1988, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> appellate court overturned a lower court decision ordering the case to trial. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

 University of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> students opposing Pentagon-funded research took over campus offices for the third time in two weeks Wednesday in one of several college protests around the nation. At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION>, nearly all the 3,200 graduate research and teaching assistants staged a walkout to demand recognition for their union. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, students who took over buildings at <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> campuses last week to protest a proposed tuition hike continued their occupation despite Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s veto of the proposal late Tuesday. Students, concerned about possible spending cuts, asked <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> to meet them at a `` neutral site'' in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, up to 175 people gathered among `` for-sale'' signs put up on <ORGANIZATION> Mercer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> for a 24-hour `` read-in'' to protest a decision to close the campus in June 1990. Students at <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> who say a planned memorial to the four students slain by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> there in 1970 is not big enough planned a protest on the 19th anniversary of the shootings Thursday. In <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, about 150 students marched to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> after an afternoon rally at the Student Union. About half that number pushed aside three campus police officers trying to block the entrance to the 2 -LCB- - story annex to the <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towers </ORGANIZATION> `` We did n't think we'd be able to get into that building,'' said organizer <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Leavitt </PERSON>, a 22-year-old junior at the 25,000-student campus. `` We thought they would be smart enough to see the potential target, and they were n't.'' Police closed the building to all but faculty members who work there, and locked a corridor holding the protesters to keep them from taking over more offices. Officers guarded other buildings. As the takeover continued late Wednesday, university administrators agreed to make public all documents relating to the research, and said a panel of students, faculty and administrators would be formed to discuss its future. The announcement followed a meeting of students, faculty and administrators. The two previous takeovers of other campus buildings resulted in 68 arrests. The <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> walkout by over union recognition came with just two weeks to go before final examinations. `` Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Union busting's got to go!'' sign-carrying teaching and research assistants chanted as they demonstrated at every major entrance to the campus. Their union, the Association for Graduate Student Employees, is affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. The students say they are underpaid, overworked and often forced to go without health and other benefits. About 90 percent ot the 3,200 graduate assistants took part in the walkout, the association claimed. There are about 9,000 graduate students at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. According to a selective survey by the association of 307 classes through Wednesday afternoon, 66 percent were canceled, 25 percent were less than half-full, and 9 percent were at capacity. University spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Debley </PERSON> said the results were not necessarily representative of the campus, which has 23,000 undergraduates. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, students released a list of demands that included no staff or faculty layoffs in the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, more social services for students and amnesty for protesters. `` We will not relinquish the buildings at this particular time because Governor <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has not met all of our demands,'' <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON>, a student at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, said at a news conference at <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` One of our major demands is to meet with <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> reiterated he would not meet with students while sit-ins continued. `` I'll talk to them when they're legal,'' he said in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>. `` If there's anything that education should start with, the first rule is you live by the law.''

The company said it would meet with leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technicians </ORGANIZATION>, but only to reiterate its position. `` We want to meet with the union as soon as possible to make sure the leadership and its members understand that the terms of our final offer will not be renegotiated,'' said company spokeswoman <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Matson </PERSON>. The union's chief negotiator, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, said he would meet with company officials, and expressed optimism they would negotiate further. `` That's what the collective bargaining process is all about,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` We're not in a strike-vote situation yet.'' A dozen of <ORGANIZATION> NABET </ORGANIZATION>'s 18 bargaining units voted to reject the company's proposal, said union spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Krieger </PERSON>. WLS-AM radio news writers, who are considered part of a 19th unit, also rejected the offer. All units must ratify a contract before it can take effect, <PERSON> Krieger </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Matson </PERSON> said the company felt `` sad and dismayed'' about the rejection. The number of workers represented is disputed. <PERSON> Krieger </PERSON> said there are 2,477 workers, while <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> says there are 2,150. The union did not release the vote tally. Union negotiators had recommended rejection of the offer, which was made after a month of negotiations that ended March 31. About 85 percent of the workers are engineers who handle cameras, lights and audio equipment and other technical tasks. The union also represents news writers, mail messengers, receptionists, wardrobe specialists and others. The average engineer makes $ 47,000 in base pay, <PERSON> Krieger </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said that with overtime the average engineer earns about $ 70,000. The rejected contract would have provided a one-time 10 percent ratification bonus if approved by May 15, in lieu of a raise in the first year. The bonus drops to 3 percent if the contract is ratified after May 15. The rejected pact also would have provided 3 percent wage increases in the second and third years and a 5 percent lump sum bonus in the fourth year. The offer also included a virtual guarantee that none of the about 2,000 full-time television employees would be laid off in the contract's first three years. Capital Cities-ABC said the offer would mean the layoffs of 60 or 70 radio engineers soon after ratification. The union put the figure closer to 125. <ORGANIZATION> NABET </ORGANIZATION> last struck <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> for 20 weeks in 1977 and for nine weeks in 1967. The union struck <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 for 17 weeks.

<HEAD>Religious Right Seems Mostly Quiescent, Resting On Laurels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The religious right, lacking a charismatic leader and fresh from its success in keeping a Republican in the White House, may be in danger of being pushed out of the political arena by an old foe: apathy. The Rev. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hindson </PERSON>, who each spent more than a decade leading evangelicals out of the political closet as architects of the Moral Majority, contend in a new book that religious conservatives are searching for new leadership. `` I think the vast majority of fundamentalists ... are kind of in neutral,'' said <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, once considered the successor to <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s evangelistic empire. With <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> announcing his withdrawal from politics and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s unsuccessful presidential candidacy, <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> said, `` There is no charismatic person to put it together.'' <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hindson </PERSON>, authors of `` The Seduction of Power: Preachers, Politics and the Media,'' discussed the emergence of the religious right as a political force at a recent conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hindson </PERSON> said the religious right's success in electing former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ who support evangelical positions on abortion and `` family life'' issues _ may have left some evangelicals apathetic. `` They do n't see themselves threatened by the political party in power,'' said <PERSON> Hindson </PERSON>. One poll showed more than 80 percent of white evangelicals supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he said. `` I think the average fundamentalist-evangelical is thinking, ` Hey, eight more good years. Why worry about it?''' The exception to the political inertia among religious conservatives is the abortion issue, <PERSON> Hindson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> said. Operation Rescue _ a series of protests outside abortion clinics _ shows increased activism among `` younger, more radical'' religious conservatives, said <PERSON> Hindson </PERSON>, a former religion professor at <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> before becoming executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biblical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counseling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. For evangelicals who believe abortion involves the taking of a human life, <PERSON> Hindson </PERSON> said, `` It is the ultimate moral issue of our times.'' The march on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of at least 300,000 people advocating legalized abortion may jar more evangelicals back into the political arena, he added. `` I think what happened ... is going to cause or force renewed coalitions among Catholics and evangelicals on the abortion issue.'' In their book, <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hindson </PERSON> say the religious right has had mixed success with its political agenda, fending off the Equal Rights Amendment and the gay rights movement, but failing to bring about significant changes on issues such as abortion and public school prayers. But <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> dismisses criticism that fundamentalists were exploited by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He contends the religious right was `` granted legitimacy'' by the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would argue the religious right used the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as much as the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> used the religious right,'' said <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, a former editor of the Fundamentalist Journal who worked with <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> for 15 years before becoming the senior pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Calvary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in Grand Rapids, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. Still, the men said, the new prominence fundamentalists have enjoyed in the media has also been a mixed blessing, with the downfall in sex scandals of TV evangelists <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> bringing unwanted notoriety. When <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> tried to step in to save <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry, <PERSON> Hindson </PERSON> said, he became `` a man in a white suit stomping all over the barnyard.'' <PERSON> Hindson </PERSON> also said his old boss, through such actions as labeling Nobel Peace Prize winner <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> a `` phony'' and his religiously based defense of such individuals as <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and deposed <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, provided an example of the dangers of stretching religious principles to defend extreme political views. Saying evangelicals need to keep their political involvement in perspective, <PERSON> Hindson </PERSON> told a joke about <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> that is making the rounds of evangelical pastors: `` Why would God let <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberston </PERSON> run for the presidency? `` One reason was to keep him out of the ministry and the other was to keep him out of the White House.''

<HEAD>Bad Cop, Good Cop _ Bush and Cheney</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's a tactic familiar to anyone who watches television crime shows _ the bad cop is menacing, the good cop is calm and reassuring, and they're both out for the same thing. By design or by accident, Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> is cast as the bad cop in the flap over his forecast of failure for Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to change the society he leads. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> are the good guys, cheering on the economic and political reforms <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has undertaken. They venture no guesses on the outcome. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> never said he did n't want perestroika to succeed. What he said was that he did n't like the odds and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should n't make wholesale defense cuts on the assumption that the new look in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will be permanent. That's hardly a surprising observation for the man assigned to steer the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Nor is it a new one. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> speculated 10 days ago that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might eventually be forced to change to a more conservative course or to yield power. And <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> is not the only skeptic in the new administration. The course has been one of caution while policies are reviewed and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> tries to determine how solid the changes in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> may prove to be. `` Looking around the world today, in the developing countries and even in the communist bloc, we see the triumph of two great ideas _ the idea of free government and the idea of free enterprise,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday. But there is no sign of haste to overhaul <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense policies because of the changes in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, including <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s multiple target peace campaign. In Red Square last Monday, flowers and peace banners supplanted the menacing missiles of past May Day parades. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s question is whether that can last. Even the humor shows signs of the times. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joked in a speech Monday that the ministry of economic planning had its own unit in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> parade, `` 200 economists marching along yelling ` Mayday, mayday.''' After the laughter, he added, `` but today that's beginning to change. The <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> comments that stirred all this into a weekend controversy were made in an April 29 interview with columnists <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> on Cable News Network. In it, the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary said `` until we know that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is for real and that the changes he wants to bring about are irreversible,'' it would be a mistake for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to cut its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> forces. Then came the impolitic comment that led to the flap: `` I think you have to distinguish between what he's trying to do and whether or not he's actually going to be able to do it. And I think the bottom line is that if I had to guess today, I would guess that he would ultimately fail. That is to say that he will not be able to reform the Soviet economy to turn it into an efficient, modern society, and when that happens, he's likely to be replaced by somebody who will be far more hostile than he's been in terms of his attitude toward the West.'' Later in the interview, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said he thinks <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has set an impossible task by seeking fundamental reform of the Soviet system within a relatively short time. `` You have to be cautious not to perceive greater change than actually occurs,'' he said. `` We've had a brief period of time with a man who appears to be more of a realist and pursuing policies friendlier to the West. We do n't know whether that's a permanent change that's going to last or whether it's a temporary aberration. `` As long as there's a possibility it's an aberration, we have to be careful.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his spokesmen were quick to disown the oddsmaking on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s future. The president said he wants the economic reforms of perestroika to succeed, and that he'd told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> so when they met in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, prior to his inauguration. `` Whenever in the world there is economic reform, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be hoping that reform succeeds,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. `` Economic reform, with its emphasis on incentives and market economics, leads to more freedom.'' The White House spokesman said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> all want the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reforms to succeed. `` We all agree that glasnost and perestroika should be encouraged,'' said <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. And does the administration believe the reforms will succeed? `` The administration chooses not to speculate on that matter.''

 <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> says `` The Golden Girls'' began with a suggestion that she write about a group of older women in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. But when the `` suggestion'' comes from <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, it's a little hard to dismiss. `` I had n't wanted to do any more television,'' said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who had created `` Soap'' and `` Benson.'' `` But that appealed to me. I like writing about older people. They have more to say. They've led rich lives. That's really how it started. After that I came up with the concept and the characters. We got the stars we wanted.'' The 100th episode of `` The Golden Girls'' airs Saturday. The Emmy-winning series just completed its third season. It was fifth in the Nielsen ratings for the season.

The cast of the pilot also included a gay houseboy, but he was reluctantly dropped when the roles of the four women proved to be much richer than expected. `` The contrast between the four women breeds the conflict,'' said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. `` We had to make them quite different or you'd end up with 30 minutes of ` nice.' <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> comes from <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. She's the most outspoken, the sharpest, the strongest character. She's a survivor. Rose is not quite in the world. She's been protected all her life, so there's a bit of the ingenue about her. She's an innocent, a bit like <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> in ` Soap.' `` Blanche is a throwback to the Old South. She's antebellum. She's <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>. She thinks she's hot stuff, but she's growing older and is having a tough time <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> is an Italian mother who spent a lot of time in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. She's a tough cookie. We gave her a small stroke that wiped out her brain censor so she could say what everyone else would like to say but does n't.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said she believes there's lots of life left in the `` Girls'' and that the award-winning show can go on for many more years. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> confines her writing these days to motion pictures. `` My husband calls me the creator-deserter,'' she said. After `` Soap,'' she married <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> of Witt-Thomas Productions, makers of `` The Golden Girls'' and `` Empty Nest.'' She no longer writes episodic TV because for four years she wrote every script for `` Soap.'' `` I will never, ever do that again,'' she said. `` I had to give up my life to do that. It was a nightmare. I never stopped working. I could n't get sick. I worked day and night. I'll never do that again. My son was 9 or 10 at the time, and I did n't get to see much of him. `` It's a tradeoff. Before ` Soap' I lived in a tiny house in the Valley. I discussed it with my son. I said this was a way to buy a house. So when he was 14, he had a nice house with a swimming pool. I do n't regret it. It gave me a chance to be more creative than I'd ever been. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said she now works slowly. She also takes plenty of time out to spend with her family, which now includes a new baby. Before she began writing she was a housewife who held a number of different jobs. `` I began writing the way a lot of people do,'' she said. `` I was watching TV one night and it was such garbage. I said I could write better than that. I got a copy of a teleplay and used it as a guide. I sold the first thing I wrote, a script for ` Then Came <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON>.''' After that she wrote for `` All in the Family,'' `` Maude'' and other comedies, then created `` Fay.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> is still angry about the fate of `` Soap.'' She said it was the victim of misinformation and was canceled after four years on the air because of pressure from conservative groups who thought it too risque. `` It could have gone on for many years,'' she said. `` Some stations would n't even run it in prime time. I think the show was done in good taste. It's all so innocuous today.''

<HEAD>Home Equity Credit: Handle With Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Among the many financial innovations of the 1980s, few have achieved as much broad popularity as the home-equity loan. It is n't hard to understand why. Home-equity loans serve as a convenient way to tap one of the nation's greatest pools of wealth. On top of that, changes in the laws have given them a special tax status. In contrast to most other types of consumer borrowing, interest paid on the typical home-equity loan remains fully deductible, within specified limits. But with all their advantages, home-equity loans also carry with them more potential risks and drawbacks than many people realize, financial advisers say. As <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellentuck </PERSON> at the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Laventhol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horwath </ORGANIZATION> puts it: `` Home-equity loan agreements, like cigarette packages, should carry a consumer warning in large type _ ` Caution! This loan could be hazardous to your financial health.''' The biggest pitfall in home-equity borrowing _ the risk of losing your house if you ca n't keep up with payments _ has been widely publicized, and deservedly so. This point alone makes a powerful case against using home-equity credit for any frivolous or short-term purpose, such as a vacation or a shopping spree. Ideally, the money borrowed should finance an asset with a vaue at least as great as the total cost of the loan, and expected to last at least as long as the term of the loan. The most obvious example of this kind of asset would be improvements to the property itself. `` Say you take out a 10-year home equity loan to finance a new car,'' <PERSON> Ellentuck </PERSON> observes. `` The car is gone long before you've paid off your loan. By stretching the debt over so long a period, you're just racking up huge interest charges.'' This may seem to be plain common sense. But <PERSON> Ellentuck </PERSON> points out that there are some other possible perils with home-equity loans that are n't so readily apparent. Home-equity credit often is touted as an inexpensive way to borrow, since lenders generally charge lower interest rates on loans backed by such solid collateral. Although that may be true in principle, <PERSON> Ellentuck </PERSON> says, appraisal costs, other up-front charges and annual account fees make some equity loans a lot more costly than the stated interest rate suggests. Watch out in particular, he counsels, for deals with bargain-basement `` teaser'' interest rates that can be raised sharply just a few months after the loan is made. In many home-equity deals, borrowers are allowed to pay only interest charges for a period of time without repaying any of the principal. Whatever advantages that may afford, <PERSON> Ellentuck </PERSON> points out, it makes a loan more expensive than a conventional arrangement in which payments cover both interest and part of the principal. That's because the balance due remains at its original, high level. Furthermore, such a setup typically leaves you faced with a `` balloon'' payment at the end of the loan's term, which may or may not be easy to finance at that time. `` If you're seriously considering a home equity loan, shop around,'' <PERSON> Ellentuck </PERSON> concludes. `` Look for a loan that imposes no points on closing, offers a low cap on the increase in your variable interest rate, and charges annual fees of $ 20 or less.''

<HEAD>Why We Save So Little</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One reason why Americans save so little is the bomb, said the professor. If there's no tomorrow, that is, you'll just be a gone fool This is the latest contribution to the literature of why Americans do n't save more of their income. It is now a massive collection and growing; no academic can retain his reputation without taking a stab at the problem. The bomb thesis has been developed by <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Slemrod </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>. Based on his studies of 20 non-communist nations, the low-saving American registers the highest level of fear of nuclear war. In 1986, he explains, 49 percent of his American respondents felt there was an `` even or better-than-even chance'' of a nuclear war within 10 years. At the same time, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings rate was 19th. Only <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s rate was lower. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, on the other hand, only 15 percent of those surveyed in the same year believed the chance of nuclear war within a decade was 50 percent or better. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s savings rate was bettered only by <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Slemrod </PERSON> believes the evidence might compel a lot of economists to revise their views of why Americans save relatively little. In the past, he says, `` a lot of people have been blaming it on taxes and the social security system.'' And, you might add, on dozens of other things. On demographics, for example. A surge of 25-to-34-year-olds has been coursing through the economy. They must buy furniture, houses, cars, children's clothing and such with money that otherwise might have been put into savings. According to the theory, as these yuppies become older they'll transmogrify into couch potatoes They will sit before their television sets, content not to keep buying and traveling. They will save and invest for the future. That's just one notion. Among the others is that the methodology by which savings statistics are amassed is faulty. As some explain it, Americans use their houses as banks, but the statisticians do n't count that as saving. Social Security and private pension plans have been blamed. They make Americans complacent about their futures, it is said, although that notion is receiving a severe jolt from the actual, painful experiences of retirees. There is no end to the possibilities that have been seriously studied at academic institutions, analyzed by elected officials and speculated on by economists. But there are also some very obvious reasons that require no study. Such as: _ In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, savings are taxed It used to be even worse: Savings were taxed while debt earned the borrower a great tax deduction. In regard to housing debt it remains so. Even credit card debt still gets a small deduction. The tax system in many other countries encourages saving, even exempting some earned interest from the tax collector. That idea caught on strongly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a decade or so ago with <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounts </ORGANIZATION>. But IRAs have since been weakened. Taxes on interest earnings are deferred, but no longer is there a tax deduction. _ In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, keeping up with the <ORGANIZATION> Joneses </ORGANIZATION> is a much derided but much practiced philosophy of life This is a consumer society, not a saver society. If you do n't think so, examine the basic theme of many advertisements: If your neighbor has something why do n't you? Are n't you as good in every way as your neighbor? Then demonstrate it. Consider some of the other themes: One car is not enough. Neither is one bath in your house. In fact, one house is n't enough; good heavens, what do you do on weekends? Save? Banks are for saving, are n't they? Maybe not, as you might conclude from examining the literature you receive from them. How many seek to have you save with them? How many offer you credit instead? The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personal savings rate rarely exceeds 6 percent, compared with 20 percent or so in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. It is indeed puzzling, and social scientists will question each other about it for many academic years. The answer, however, is far more likely to come directly from the source _ from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> consumer, who may indeed save little because of the bomb, but who also might be borrowing more for the same reason.

 In the temporary <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> office, one clock runs five minutes faster than another a few feet away, an unintended symbol of a government thrown out of sync by the alleged corruption of its chairman. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, who had held the highest office of the 200,000-member tribe with one interruption since 1971, was voted out by the tribal council in February following allegations that he demanded kickbacks. The 60-year-old <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, who says he's innocent, has lived for years like a potentate in plain view of Indians whose austere circumstances are proverbial. And yet while he rode in limousines and flew to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and the Super Bowl, he also promised economic development _ a vision of herdsmen becoming technicians. After spending $ 650,000 to remodel his offices following his January 1987 inauguration, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> was secure in his fourth term until January when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs began investigating corruption in tribal governments. Witness after witness told of <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> demanding kickbacks. His son, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> `` Rocky'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, testified after receiving immunity from prosecution, using a code term in speaking of under-the-table payments to his father as `` golf balls.'' When the 88-member <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> began its winter meeting in early February, it rebelled. On Feb. 17, a Friday night after many <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> supporters had left, the dissidents voted 49-13 to place him and Vice Chairman <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> on administrative leave. The majority picked <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> as interim chairman on March 10 and has stood united since, giving rise to th name `` 49ers.'' `` The joke around here is that it's the 49ers versus the Stealers,'' said <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chinle </LOCATION>. Past Navajo leaders `` usually were very wealthy men, but I would n't say they compare to <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyal </PERSON>, <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON>'s press secretary and chief assistant to former chairman <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> <PERSON> Zah </PERSON>. `` With them, they were counting herds of sheep; with <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, it's the green stuff.'' In visits to some of the 109 reservation chapters, or wards, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has maintained his innocence. He has refused repeated <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> requests for interviews and declined to respond in writing to a list of questions. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the council action, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> refused to stop giving orders or vacate what <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> calls `` the Mahogany Palace'' wing of the administration building. `` I am innocent. And I am entitled under the law to be presumed innocent. But the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> could care less,'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> wrote in an opinion piece for the Gallup -LRB- <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> -RRB- Independent. He has acknowledged taking `` gifts'' from contractors but argues gift exchanges are a time-honored way of doing business by Indian chiefs. To <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON>, that's a distortion of Indian tradition. `` Those gifts were tokens to establish a longterm friendship with an individual, not hundreds of thousands of dollars but small things _ bracelets, moccasins, a shawl,'' <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> said. No one knows how much <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> realized from the tribe's 1987 purchase of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boquillas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION>, a 491,000-acre spread in north-central <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> real estate broker <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> `` Bud'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> testified that he arranged for a <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION> oilman to buy the ranch for $ 26.2 million and sell it a few hours later to the Navajos for $ 33.4 million. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he gave <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> $ 50,000 in cash and the use of a BMW sedan, along with paying off a $ 25,000 loan; dissidents claim <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> may have received one-tenth of the profit. A federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> is investigating the allegations. In 1975, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> was indicted on fraud and income-tax-evasion charges. A deadlocked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court jury in May 1977 failed to reach a verdict, and the judge ordered a directed verdict of acquittal. The longtime tribal leader is not without defenders. `` Mr. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> is a very strong statesman for Indian people across the country,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Benally </PERSON>, chairman of the council's <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> until <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> named a new panel. `` I think we would have really made a big stride in our economic development if Mr. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> would've gone on without any political interruptions.'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, an electrical engineer, worked in the aerospace industry in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> before he returned to the reservation, where people still live in traditional, five-sided, log-and-mud hogans tucked into remote canyons or squatting atop wind-swept mesas. The native of Teec Nos Pos, a tiny community less than five miles from both <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in the Four Corners heartland of Navajo tradition, served three terms as chairman before <PERSON> Zah </PERSON> won the 1982 election. Four years later, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Zah </PERSON> by about 750 votes out of 61,000 cast. <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> said he does n't know whether he'll run for the $ 55,000-a-year position in 1990. He added that he expects the chairmanship to have less power when he leaves office. `` I never sought this job; it just happened so fast,'' said the 43-year-old civil engineer. <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> has persuaded the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> that he is legally in charge. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> director, said courts had upheld the council majority's action despite <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s claim that a two-thirds majority was needed to remove him from office. Noting that <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> had decided to honor <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON>'s signature on checks, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> strengthened <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON>'s hand on April 6 by empowering him to allocate contracts controlling $ 91 million in federal funds for such purposes as <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> police work, forest management, fire and judicial services. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlos </LOCATION> Apache who grew up in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, views the council's action as a legal housecleaning, but <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has claimed that the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> is trying to undermine tribal sovereignty. `` This happens in foreign countries, not the <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> nation,'' said council delegate <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> <PERSON> Tully </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Teesto </LOCATION>. `` They are copying communistic countries.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapela </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Window </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> attorney who claims to have gathered 37,000 signatures in a drive to recall <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, has visited about 25 chapters to show the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> videotapes. `` Mr. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> is his own downfall,'' said <PERSON> Chapela </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has fired from three tribal positions. He said <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> is `` our best salesman of the need for a constitution'' that would ensure accountability and spell out procedures for removing leaders. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> rejects a constitution as `` an Anglo form of government.'' And <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> said tailoring a constitution to tribal needs would `` require extensive discussion, debates and public hearings.'' Meanwhile, the uncertainty continues. <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, director of the Navajo ethics office, said she believes many people remain neutral about <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, with few recognizing <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> as a legitimate successor. `` I think there should be a new election for chairman,'' she said.

<HEAD>Saab 9000 CD Is Impressive Roadholder</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION>'s new flagship model, the 1989 9000 CD, is an impressive roadholder. A fine suspension package helps it handle curves and winding stretches with ease. A turbocharged, 16-valve four-cylinder engine helps the car tackle even mountain roads with zest. Antilock brakes make sudden stops uneventful. And attention to ergonomic detail inside takes the weariness out of travel. <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> can be proud of this, its first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offering of a sedan and one of the largest among European sedans sold here. The 9000 CD is new, yet still <PERSON> Saabish </PERSON> in that it continues the <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> tradition of performance and practicality. For example, the test car _ with five-speed manual transmission _ got 24.6 miles per gallon, a surprisingly good show of practicality considering the maneuvers it went through. The four-cylinder engine was thrifty, but the turbocharger contributed plenty of zip. The powerplant is the same as the one in the 9000 Turbo. `` We have been taken to task for not going to six - or eight-cylinders like some other Europeans, but we think that with the 16-valve four-cylinder and turbocharger, we have the best of both worlds,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ventrilio </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> spokesman `` Saab boasts that the engine has the potential to not only surpass 130 miles per hour but to cruise at such speeds without complaint literally for days on end.'' Handling was enjoyable, with good traction and agile performance. <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> engineers its 9000s so 60 percent of the weight is over the front-drive wheels for stable maneuvering. The 9000 CD has the same, rounded styling in front that also is a Saab hallmark. But the rear is decidedly new. For this new model, the automaker added six more inches in length to its 9000 Turbo hatchback and put in a large, flat trunk with 19.8 cubic feet capacity. The trunk lid pulls up easily, and you do n't have to heave items up and over the car body. Behind the rear seat armrest is a small door that can be opened to allow long items, such as skis to pass through and be carried inside the auto. `` We felt there was a market for -LRB- a sedan -RRB- in this country, looking at the BMWs and Mercedes,'' <PERSON> Ventrilio </PERSON> said. Other competitiors include the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 200 and <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> 760 series, he said. The test 9000 CD had leather interior, so the base price was nearly $ 32,000. Standard features included sunroof, anti-theft alarm, and AM-FM stereo-cassette with seven-band graphic equalizer. Fit and finish inside and out was superb. The front seats were immensely comfortable, having been orthopedically shaped for support without causing drowsiness or muscle tension. The front seats also were heated, had eight-way power adjustment and lumbar support. The dashboard was easy to read _ no digital stuff here. Even the clock was the traditional model with hands. The interior was spacious, although a 6-foot-2 fellow complained his head brushed the roof when he sat in the back seat. But legroom was clearly adequate, and the car could carry five in fine style. <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> also has nice touches. The company put red lights at the opening of the seat belt fasteners so they are easier to find at night. The center console storage space had a subtle green light inside, not a glaring, bright one. And all the knobs in the instrument panel are rounded, so there's no protruding, dangerous elements in a crash. <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> has one of the highest owner loyalty records in the industry. `` Our dealers tell us they've been selling to some of the same people for the last 20 years,'' <PERSON> Ventrilio </PERSON> said. Buyers typically are males in their early 40s. They are highly affluent and college educated, according to <LOCATION> Ventrilio </LOCATION>. It looks as if the 9000 CD could bring in even more buyers as the company looks to expand in the West and Sunbelt. <PERSON> Ventrilio </PERSON> said since the 9000 CDs were available in decent quantities starting in January, the cars outsold their sibling, the 9000 hatchback models for each of the first three months of 1989. In total, 879 of the 9000 CDs were sold in the period, and <PERSON> Ventrilio </PERSON> says the company plans to import 4,700 this year. Consumer Reports magazine has no rating on the new model but ranked the 1986 9000 Turbo average in owner reports of trouble. The 1987 model ranked worse than average.

 <PERSON> Roxana </PERSON> <PERSON> Zal </PERSON> says she formed a quick friendship with <PERSON> Cissy </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> after playing the young mother in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> movie `` Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>.'' `` We were very excited to meet each other,'' said <PERSON> Zal </PERSON>. `` It was strange at first. A little awkward. Then we got along great. I think we formed a bond. We write to each other. We're keeping in touch. `` Neither of us had any walls up. We both wanted to help each other. <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> took to me, too. She climbed right up on my lap.'' The two-hour movie, airing Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, is about the rescue of 18-month-old <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> after she fell down an abandoned well near her home in <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, on Oct. 14, 1987. She was trapped 19 feet underground in a space only eight inches wide. `` It's a real ensemble movie,'' said <PERSON> Zal </PERSON>. `` It shows how the whole town came together to save the life of this child.'' <PERSON> Zal </PERSON> said she had talked to <PERSON> Cissy </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> several times on the telephone before she started the role. `` I think it was better that I did n't see her until afterward,'' she said. `` I would have been nervous if she'd been on the set. We tried to make it as accurate as possible, but there may have been a few dramatic changes.'' The movie also stars Beau Bridges as Police Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Czech </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Hingle </PERSON> as Fire Chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> as <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, the victims' assistance volunteer who helped the <ORGANIZATION> McClures </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> as <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>'s father. The movie was filmed largely on location in <LOCATION> Bellflower </LOCATION>, a city about 12 miles southwest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` They made it look just like the original site,'' said <PERSON> Zal </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Wunsch </PERSON>, the reporter from KMID-TV who plays himself, said it was so similar it brought back all those terrible thoughts.'' <PERSON> Zal </PERSON>, who won an Emmy in 1984 for her role in `` Something About Amelia,'' said she had followed the story of <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> and was interested when her agent called about the offer. `` My first thought, however, was that it might be difficult,'' she said. `` Some films based on news events sound great, but the scripts do n't always work out. I knew it would be difficult to turn those 56 hours into a good movie. But the script turned out well, and I liked it. I like the role, too, because I get to play a mother. I've always played daughters and teen-agers before.'' <PERSON> Zal </PERSON> worked on the role while continuing her studies as a second-year student at <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm studying world arts and cultures,'' she said. `` I switched from theater arts. I get dance, music, art history and anthropology. My theater major had too many technical classes and labs. You had to take all the production courses first before you got to the fun stuff. I'm more interested in acting, directing and playwriting. I'm trying to develop my writing skills.'' Her most recent project was `` Goodbye, Miss 4th of July'' for the Disney Channel. It was based on the true story of <PERSON> Niki </PERSON> <PERSON> Janus </PERSON>, a member of a Greek immigrant family who fought back against discrimination by the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> in 1917. The movie also starred <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chantal </PERSON> <PERSON> Contouri </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. She made her film debut as <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Voight </PERSON>'s daughter in `` Table for Five. She was also in `` Testament,'' `` River's Edge,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schoolbreak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> `` God, The Universe and Hot Fudge Sundaes'' and played the daughter of an alcoholic in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> movie `` Shattered Spirits.'' `` After the commercial I was in a pilot,'' she said. `` Then I decided I did n't want to do a series and prayed it would not go. I really do n't want to do a series. I would n't be able to go to college if I was in a series. `` I started acting when I was 11. I'd wanted to start when I was 8, but my parents would n't let me. Finally an aunt told them to let me try it or I'd grow up resenting them. I can pick and choose my roles. My parents have provided very well for me and I do n't have to take anything just to pay the bills.'' She said she was considering several things for the summer. `` It's so hard to find a good script and the competition is so tough,'' she said. `` That's why it's good to be in school. I'm not just sitting around waiting for the telephone to ring.''

 Drug abuse has been very, very good to <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Lousig-Nont </PERSON>. So has theft. <PERSON> Lousig-Nont </PERSON> has built a career out of finding people who steal and use drugs _ and helping prospective employers steer clear of them. With a doctorate in industrial psychology, Lousig-Nont has developed a series of tests he says help companies screen job applicants based on their own admissions of attitudes and behavior. Last year <ORGANIZATION> Lousig-Nont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> sold 300,000 honesty tests, and business is booming. `` There's been a tremendous influx this year because of the anti-polygraph legislation,'' he said, referring to a recent law that bans most private employers' use of lie detector tests. With sales exceeding $ 1 million last year, <PERSON> Lousig-Nont </PERSON>'s business has grown at an annual average of 57 percent since he began selling a comparatively crude version of his now-patented honesty tests in 1978 He predicts sales will double by 1990. Lousig-Nont was a police officer in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, in the 1970s when he developed a reputation for interrogating suspects by using a low-key, straightforward approach. His 95 percent confession rate made him a stand-out, he said in an interview. `` I was sort of blown away by the fact that if I asked someone a question, they'd usually give you the answer,'' he said. `` If they lied to you, they became so guilty looking and would start pulling at their collar or something that it was obvious.'' It was that same approach that led him to develop the tests now used by companies nationwide. Persistently surprised at how much people would tell him if he asked, <PERSON> Lousig-Nont </PERSON>'s first test contained 100 true-false questions. Since then it has been refined and now is laced with what <PERSON> Lousig-Nont </PERSON> called `` control'' questions to help determine whether the applicant is generally truthful. He said the tests provide an assessment of a prospective employee by measuring his or her `` propensity to become involved in job dishonesty.'' The tests, available in English and Spanish, sell for between $ 6 and $ 15 each, including the cost of an evaluation analysis by <PERSON> Lousig-Nont </PERSON>'s company. It is substantially cheaper than a urine test to detect drug use. Now 40 and a millionaire, <PERSON> Lousig-Nont </PERSON> is one of a few individuals who can go up against much larger test marketers such as <ORGANIZATION> Stanton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Reid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>. His tests have been used by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convenience </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shack </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wackenhut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the national security firm, which has certain rights to market the tests. <ORGANIZATION> Wackenhut </ORGANIZATION> has `` intros into a lot of companies I could n't get my foot in the door,'' <PERSON> Lousig-Nont </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lousig-Nont </PERSON>'s next project, he said, is to develop a personality profile that will help determine whether an individual is suited for a particular job. For example, an accountant does n't have to be an extrovert, but the trait certainly is useful for a publicist.

 We know <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> the writer, who gave us such ground-breaking novels as `` To the Lighthouse,'' `` Mrs. <PERSON> Dalloway </PERSON>'' and `` The Waves.'' We know <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> the feminist, who wrote the influential essay `` A Room of One's Own,'' and <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> the pacifist, who created `` Thoughts on Peace in an Air Raid.'' We know <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> the diarist, who logged the minutiae of her tortured life, and <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> the suicide, who put a heavy stone in her pocket and waded into the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ouse </LOCATION>. But until now we have known very little about the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Woolf who was sexually abused throughout her youth. A noted Woolf scholar, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON>, provides us with the first complete portrait of that woman in `` <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Woolf </LOCATION>: The Impact of Childhood Sexual Abuse on Her Life and Work'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Beacon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, $ 22.95 -RRB-. That Woolf had been abused was no secret _ she talked about it in speeches, letters, conversations and memoirs. But previous biographers have virtually ignored its impact on her life, treating it as an aberration in an otherwise happy Victorian household or perhaps even a hallucination of her `` madness.'' <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON>, a professor of English at <ORGANIZATION> Hunter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, is the first academician to thoroughly examine the abuse in light of modern-day research on incest survivors. `` It's not as if it was hidden as a topic in any of the biographies that have come before,'' <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON> said in a recent interview at her Hunter office. `` But the major change is that in the last 10 years the work on incest and child abuse as a field has been so monumental that it enabled someone like me to use that work and to read her life in the context of what we now know the effect of incest and child abuse are.'' A brief outline of <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woolf </ORGANIZATION>'s family and the abuse suffered, based on <ORGANIZATION> Woolf </ORGANIZATION>'s diaries, letters and recorded conversations with others: <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Duckworth </PERSON> and Sir <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON>'s parents, had each been married before they wed in 1878 <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Duckworth </PERSON> were children of <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>'s previous marriage; <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> was a child of Sir <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>'s first marriage. <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> had four children together: <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Thoby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON>. <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON>'s mother died when she was 13 and about that time her half brother, <PERSON> George </PERSON>, 14 years her senior, began sexually molesting her and her sister, <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON>. The abuse continued until <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> was in her early 20s and stopped only when she had a nervous breakdown after her father died and the household was broken up. <PERSON> Stella </PERSON>, <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON>'s half sister who took over the running of the household after their mother's death, may have become Sir <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>'s lover after his wife died Late in her life, <LOCATION> Woolf </LOCATION>, in a period of intense self-analysis while writing her autobiography, suddenly remembered an incident that had apparently been repressed of being molested by her other half brother, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON>, when she was 6, in which he broke her hymen. <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON> thinks <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> was devastated by the realization that the abuse began far earlier than she had believed. There is plenty of other evidence of the household as a dysfunctional family: <ORGANIZATION> Woolf </ORGANIZATION> had an erotic relationship with her sister, <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON>, that lasted into their 20s; <ORGANIZATION> Woolf </ORGANIZATION>'s half sister, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON>, whom the family considered mentally deficient, was locked up in a distant room in the house for years before being trundled off to an asylum; <ORGANIZATION> Woolf </ORGANIZATION>'s brother, <PERSON> Thoby </PERSON>, threw himself out of a window when he was 15; <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> had an affair with <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON>'s husband; after her divorce, <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> took up with the homosexual lover of her brother <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON>. The list of family entanglements goes on and on and continues into the next generation. <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON> reread everything that <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> wrote _ every novel, diary, letter, essay and fragment that has been preserved in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ and isolated every reference to <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON>'s childhood or her fictional depictions of children `` It was when I did that that it was all thrown into stark relief, and I saw what she was trying to say,'' said <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON>. Once she learned how incest survivors talk about their experiences, <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON>'s sometimes puzzling language suddenly made sense. In a letter to <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON>'s husband, for example, <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> writes almost flippantly about the sexual abuse the two suffered. <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON> said that is an example of `` inappropriate response'' that victims of incest often use as a defense mechanism. `` The key to my own beginning to be able to figure it out was learning what the language of incest survivors is, learning the verbal strategies. How survivors of incest tend to create inflated pictures of their parents. ... `` I could n't figure out, for example, for the longest time why <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> wrote these revered portraits of her father. If you take them straight, that's one thing, but if you read how incest survivers typically talk about the family constellation, it makes an enormous amount of sense.'' One of the points DeSalvo makes in her book is that some of the symptoms of the bouts of `` madness'' Woolf suffered throughout her life _ depression, nervousness, irritability, tantrums _ are likely responses to the sexual abuse rather than the congenital condition it is often treated as. <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON> was asked whether she ever thought <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON>, with her history of instability, was perhaps an `` unreliable narrator.'' The memory of the abuse by <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> when she was 6, for example, did not surface until <PERSON> Woolf </PERSON> was in her 50s. Can her memory be trusted? `` One of the biggest issues that always comes up in incestuous abuse is the extent to which people falsify memories. The paradigm used to be Freudian -LRB- the theory that patients' reports of sexual abuse were figments of their imaginations and based on desire -RRB-. ... All the recent work that has been done on incest survivors suggest rather the opposite _ that any memories are authentic, and the reason experts say this is that it is so disastrous, even today, to be labeled an incest survivor that no one would falsify that.'' <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON> is the editor of `` Melymbrosia,'' an early version of <ORGANIZATION> Woolf </ORGANIZATION>'s novel `` The Voyage Out,'' which she constructed from manuscripts, and co-editor with <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Leaska </PERSON> of `` <PERSON> Vita </PERSON> <PERSON> Sackville-West </PERSON>'s Letters to <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woolf </ORGANIZATION>.'' She has also written a book on <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON>. <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON>'s new book, as disturbing as the subject matter is, should be heralded for both its painstakingly thorough research and the delicate and fair handling of such a sensitive subject. This is a scholarly, not a titillating work. At the same time, it is enormously readable and imbued with the fascination and admiration that <PERSON> DeSalvo </PERSON> has for one of the greatest writers of this century.

 Prices dipped lower in dull and directionless trading on Wall Street Tuesday as many investors stayed on the sidelines. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 12.10 points to 2,402.86. The dollar finished higher against several key currencies. Gold weakened slightly. Bond prices regained ground as oil prices declined and the government issued two reports suggesting an economic slowdown. Petroleum futures prices dropped sharply; grain and soybean futures dropped; precious metals closed lower; and livestock and pork prices rallied.

 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> will implement computerized off-hours trading if companies and investment firms want it, but no such demand exists now, says the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Tuesday there has been no interest among <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stock market participants to extend trading at the world's second-largest exchange beyond the current 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. hours `` The reason we have not done it is that our customers have said they do n't want it,'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> told a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> and Writers. But, he added, `` If there is any sign of interest out there at all we will try at least some off-hours trading.'' In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> surveyed securities brokerages and companies listed on the exchange, <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said, and `` 99 percent of all those people said, ` For God's sake, do n't do it. We are not interested in that now.''' The 197-year-old <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, second in size to the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, recently announced it would meet with customers, traders, institutional investors, listed companies and securities firms to re-gauge demand for off-hours trading. Under such a system, securities theoretically can be bought and sold when the exchange floor is shut down via computers that automatically match buyers and sellers from points around the world. The tiny <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> last month announced plans to start computerized 24-hour trading in the next 19 months. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s two futures markets also have announced they are developing after-hours trading systems <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> played down fears expressed by some securities industry experts that markets in foreign countries could siphon away business from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said the idea of a global market had not yet taken hold, and that overseas `` there's more potential than actual'' competition. `` Global markets and 24-hour markets, despite all the trendy talk, are not there because the customers do n't want them,'' he said. `` In the off-hours market there's not going to be a heck of a lot of orders,'' he added. `` Most pension funds are not going to wait until two o'clock in the morning to make a trade. The major pool of liquidity is going to be when this market opens.'' But <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> conceded that Japanese investors buying more stock in American companies listed on the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> exchange could some day pose a threat. He said 90 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies currently trade in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` It's new money that's never been in this market before. European money has been in this market for years. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s money has never been in this market,'' he said.

 Jurors at the securities fraud trial of Singer Co.. Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> are getting a short course in corporate takeovers, tender offers and other Wall Street terminology Before defense and prosecution lawyers began their opening statements to the jury Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> took 10 minutes to explain to the jurors a number of financial terms that will come up repeatedly during the trial. The education was to continue today with a securities law expert expected to be the first government witness. In his opening statement Tuesday, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON> claimed that in 1985 and 1986, when he emerged on the corporate takeover scene, <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> `` sought to build a reputation for himself as a corporate raider'' through a series of lies. `` He lied to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, he lied to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and he lied to the investing public,'' <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON> told the jury at federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` In the past his lies brought him lots of money,'' said <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON>, pointing at <LOCATION> Bilzerian </LOCATION>. `` Today they bring him to the bar of justice.'' <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, is accused of conspiracy, violating securities and tax laws and making false statements in connection with four failed takeover attempts in 1985 and 1986. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> dismissed one felony count last month but 11 other counts remain. None of the charges involves <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>'s $ 1.06 billion takeover of Singer last year after a lengthy struggle. <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON> said another prosecution witness would be former <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> stockbroker <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, who was implicated by convicted stock speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, pleaded guilty to violating securities laws in 1987 and has turned government informant. The indictment alleges that <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> secretly held stock for <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> in four unsuccessful takeover transactions involving <ORGANIZATION> Cluett </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hammerhill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, H.H. <ORGANIZATION> Robertson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The ruse allegedly was used to help <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> secretly accumulate large stock positions in companies he later would attempt to take over. But defense attorney <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> contended his client was on trial because `` Mr. <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON>'s bosses made a dumb deal with an admitted felon,'' Jefferies. <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON>, who did not mention <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> by name, theorized that <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> _ in order to avoid more serious charges _ `` implicated a few scapegoats,'' including <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>, because he had no higher-ups on whom to inform. `` The government is straining to try and justify the bad bargain they made,'' said <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON>. If convicted, <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> faces a maximum penalty of five years in jail and a $ 250,000 fine on each count.

<HEAD>AMR, Union Reach Agreement On Contract</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A marathon bargaining session led to an agreement in principle between <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> on a new contract, averting a threatened strike at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest carrier. Neither side released details of the pact Tuesday, except a brief company statement that said union and management officials believe `` the agreement benefits both the company and the union and will enable American to continue the growth plan that has made the airline an industry leader.'' The statement by Fort Worth-based <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> said the agreement was reached after a 27-hour bargaining session. Details were withheld pending `` agreement on final language and ratification.'' The airline and union, which represents about 23,000 of the company's 67,000 employees, submitted to mediation after American's proposed $ 610 million four-year contract was rejected in March The rejected contract guaranteed raises for all employees, ranging from about 28 percent over four years to about 100 percent during the contract. However, the union objected to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s two-tier wage scale, under which it takes new employees 12 years to reach top pay The union wanted that reduced to five years. In addition, there were complaints that even with the increases, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> mechanics and ground service employees would not be the industry's highest-paid. Also at issue was the company's plan to have employees pay $ 10 per person _ and up to $ 30 per family _ toward health insurance each month. The company now pays the entire premium. The mediation continued daily from its April 14 beginning until Friday, when the parties took a two-day break before resuming Sunday, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koziatek </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> TWU </ORGANIZATION>'s international vice president for American. Airline officials have complained that the contract suffered from union politics as several locals were conducting election campaigns while the pact was up for ratification in March. The four-year pact became amendable on March 1, but was rejected 12,143-to-5 ,140 However under the federal Railway Labor Act, transportation contracts do not expire until after a lengthy process that involves mediation, followed by a 30-day cooling-off period should the mediator declare an impasse in the negotiations. The <ORGANIZATION> TWU </ORGANIZATION> represents the airline's mechanics, bag handlers, ground crews, stock clerks, guards, meteorologists and aircraft cleaners. American had its most profitable year ever last year, with those profits sustained through the first three months of this year. <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> posted 1988 net income of $ 476.8 million, a 140.3 percent increase from 1987 and 37.9 percent higher than the previous record of $ 345.8 million in 1985. The company reported a first-quarter profit of $ 101 million, a 47.7 percent jump from 1988's first three months. Operating revenues were $ 2.45 billion.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> is outlining the evolution of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> from its beginnings to its head-to-head competition with <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in a lawsuit against the photographic giant <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> struggled to keep <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> out of the instant photography field and now says in the federal suit that <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> should pay $ 12 billion in damages for infringing on its patents. In the first day of testimony Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> had a productive working relationship for decades. But things soured in the late 1960s, he said, when <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> was working on its revolutionary SX-70 camera. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, which for years had manufactured film for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>, was asked to produce the new, complex negative that <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> had developed for the instant, color camera. But <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> demanded a license from <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>, which would have allowed <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> to develop its own instant photography, said <PERSON> McCune </PERSON>, who was to resume his testimony today. `` There was considerable reluctance to undertake the project unless we gave them license,'' <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> said under questioning by <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>. `` A stumbling block was always that we could n't see how giving <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> a license to make products competitive with ours would allow us to stay in business.'' Polaroid ultimately built its own film manufacturing facilities in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Instant photography, <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> said, `` is all our bread and butter and that's everything we've got.'' <PERSON> McCune </PERSON>'s testimony before Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> ranged widely from the origins of instant photography after World War II to the introduction of the SX-70 camera in 1972. An earlier federal court decision already established that <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> infringed on Polaroid patents. The remaining question is how much <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> owes for that violation. <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> says it should pay $ 177 million, equal to 5 percent royalties on the instant cameras and film <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> sold from 1976 until 1985. <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> said the story began during the war, when <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Land </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> on a family trip. `` He took photographs of his daughter and she asked why she could n't see it right away,'' <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> said. `` He wondered too.'' By 1963, with manufacturing help from <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> developed the first color instant photography. `` The business grew rapidly in that period,'' <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> said. Revenue of $ 129 million in 1963 jumped to $ 571 million in 1972. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s profits after taxes increased from $ 25 million to $ 75 million in that time. With the introduction of the SX-70, <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> hoped for a dramatic increase in its business. `` We viewed it as a revolutionary step and thought it was going to dramatically increase the business of the company and increase the life of the business,'' <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> said. But as <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s lawyers have argued, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s competition starting in 1976 cut into profits and forced <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> to sell some cameras below cost. If <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> awards Polaroid anything close to $ 12 billion, it will be the largest patent infringement decision in history, far surpassing the record $ 207 million that <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was ordered to pay <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> three years ago for copying drill bit technology.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pork producers say they will at least get temporary relief from Canadian competition as a result of a ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on an industry complaint about subsidized Canadian exports. The government said Tuesday it will place a preliminary duty of about 3 cents a pound on Canadian shipments of fresh, chilled and frozen pork products to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The duty, in the form of a bond to be posted by importers, will take effect Friday and last until a final decision is announced sometime in the fall. If <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pork producers prevail, the bond will go into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and a permanent duty will be imposed. If the Canadians prevail, the money will be returned. But in the meantime, the bond requirements will make it more expensive to ship pork products from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Hopefully, that will slow down the surge of pork products coming in,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehlhaff </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The Des Moines-based council said shipments of such products have increased by more than 50 percent since 1984 and totaled about 470 million pounds last year. It said a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> study indicates the subsidized competition cost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pork producers $ 697 million in 1988, and that the cost to meatpackers was even greater. The pork producers have said the Canadian government was paying its producers a subsidy of $ 19.50 a hog in the third quarter of 1988 and that it rose to $ 31 a hog in the fourth quarter. The ruling was the second in a series of decisions in the case. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> issued its preliminary finding of subsidized competition in February. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will hold a June 28 hearing and issue a final decision by July 17, said Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> then will have 45 days to determine whether the imports materially injure or threaten injury to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pork industry. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingerich </PERSON> of <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>, president of the pork council, said he was delighted the government is interpreting the figures in the same way as the industry. `` These imports of pork products coming out of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, which have increased so dramatically since we put the countervailing duties on live animals, has really plagued our industry as far as the profits we are able to maintain from our herds,'' <PERSON> Gingerich </PERSON> said.

Voters also approved a plan to double the money <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> can borrow for new construction. With all votes counted in Tuesday's special election, the two-year mining tax hike won 107,679 to 30,663. The other question won by 74,418 to 63,228. Voter turnout was a low 36 percent. Election officials around the state had predicted turnouts ranging from 30 percent to 40 percent of the more than 383,000 people eligible to vote. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> is the nation's leading producer of gold. During the past eight years, mines here have produced more than 12 million troy ounces of gold with a value of about $ 5 billion. At today's prices, that's equal to the value of all the gold and silver unearthed in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> during the two-decade <PERSON> Comstock </PERSON> <PERSON> Lode </PERSON> era that began in the late 1850s. The mining tax plan was submitted to voters after bitter debate in which Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> accused mining industry lobbyists of deceit in trying to derail his proposal for $ 118 million. The industry accused him of playing `` mine games.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> responded that the industry was trying to give the state `` the mine shaft.'' Casino owners, often targeted for tax hikes because gaming is <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s largest industry, also got into the fray, arguing that it's time to change the tradition in which the mining industry did not pay its fair share of taxes. After <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s plan was rejected in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the $ 52 million plan was endorsed by most of the people who had fought over any higher payments. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> joined in an advertising campaign with mining industry leaders to say that without approval, the state would face fiscal chaos. Had the measure lost, the leaders said, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> would have needed to remain in session an extra month to slash budgets and raise taxes. `` I think it's a positive thing for the state to have these revenues available,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said late Tuesday. He added he planned to meet with legislative leaders before deciding whether any more tax revenues are needed from the miners. Assemblyman <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedway </PERSON>, Democratic chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, had opposed the $ 52 million plan. `` The amount they would be paying is just a drop in the bucket to what they should be paying,'' said <PERSON> Sedway </PERSON>. `` It -LRB- gold -RRB- is a non-renewable resource, and will be gone forever.'' The measure allows the state to impose a 5 percent tax on the net proceeds of mines during the next two years. The question resulted from an agreement during the 1987 Legislature between the mining industry, lawmakers and then-Gov. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gourdie </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he hoped passage would end this year's tax raising efforts in the Legislature. `` I'm delighted with the outcome,'' he said. `` I think the people have realized this is a reasonable and fair tax.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is getting everything he wanted and more from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to prevent <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls from tapping the taxpayers for another bailout, but only in exchange for new low-income housing initiatives. On a 49-2 vote just before midnight Tuesday, the committee approved <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 90 billion savings and loan plan _ the largest financial bailout in the nation's history _ after spending four days toughening capital standards on the industry and adding a pair of housing components. Only Reps. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, voted no <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the bill did not have enough housing support for the poor and complained about the panel's rejection of his provisions attacking lending discrimination. <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> said he wanted still tougher capital standards. As it now stands, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill would require the nation's 3,000 thrifts to put up at least $ 20 billion in new capital over the next five years _ twice as much as a version approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> two weeks ago _ to fulfill <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise of `` Never again. It also would divorce what critics had called a too-cozy relationship between S & amp; L regulators and the industry and devote $ 75 million a year to investigating and prosecuting fraud that is blamed for a major portion of the crisis. On a party-line vote, committee Democrats overrode administration objections to set aside some of the property the government is inheriting from failed S & amp; Ls for low-income housing. They also voted to require the industry to subsidize below-market mortgage rates for low-income families. Still, the overall package won praise from the administration. `` This committee exceeded everyone's expectations,'' Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> said. `` They've achieved something very close to what we asked for.'' The biggest victory for the administration is a requirement that S & amp; L owners over the next five years reach a level of having at least $ 3 of their own money in `` tangible'' capital at risk for every $ 100 they lend. `` We've moved legislation that will deal with a significant part of the problem ... and passed tough capital standards _ better than the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill and, I would argue, better than the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bill as well,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. The bill still has to go through three other committees _ including one where the erection of a formidable roadblock is anticipated later this month _ before a final vote by the full House. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the banking committee's chairman who spearheaded the administration's drive for the tougher capital requirements, said industry lobbying efforts to weaken them already have shifted there And after that, new fights over the housing subsidies that were rejected in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as `` social engineering'' are expected to erupt in a conference of leading lawmakers from both houses before a final version is sent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this summer for his approval or veto. As proposed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and now approved by both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the plan will pump $ 50 billion over the next three years into a federal insurance fund to pay off depositors whose money was lost through speculative and often fraudulent lending by some 300 to 500 S & amp; Ls. Another $ 40 billion to cover the losses of institutions closed in the past two years plus anticipated failures over the next decade _ and also shore up the insurance fund _ will come largely from new or increased fees on the industry. Altogether, the bailout costs _ including interest _ are expected to total $ 157 billion by the year 2000 and $ 275 billion by the year 2020. The government share will be raised through a complex financing plan that keeps the problem off the federal budget and avoids a tax increase, but at an interest cost to taxpayers of $ 150 billion to $ 200 billion over the next 30 years. That arrangement is likely to be questioned at least one more time by the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, one of three panels yet to review the package. However, the next big showdown will not occur until the bill reaches the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which controls what issues can be revisited on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. The rules panel's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said in a letter last week he strongly opposes parts of the new capital requirements Industry and government records indicate that 14 S & amp; Ls in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> would have to raise a total of $ 700 million to $ 800 million in new capital over the next five years or shrink in size. Rep. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, said he expects the housing provisions in the bill to be attacked on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, along with what he called one `` crystalizing amendment'' to stretch out the implementation of the tougher capital standards. But he predicted the fights there will be few and short. `` Everybody in the country and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> realizes we need to get this enacted and behind us,'' <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said. `` The bill should be signed by the president by the Fourth of July.''

<HEAD>Fed's Heller Sees Slower Growth, Steadying Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s tight-fisted monetary policy can curb inflation and prolong economic growth, but only if business leaders exercise some patience, a central bank official says. `` It takes time for monetary policy to relieve pressure on prices,'' <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> board member <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> told the mid-year meeting of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday. `` What is needed now is a bit of patience to allow the policy that is in place to work.'' <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, in a luncheon address to about 100 executives, said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is not out to take the `` proverbial punch bowl away.'' `` We would just like everyone to drink a bit more slowly so that the party can last a longer time.'' <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, who has been on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s seven-member board of governors since 1986, defended the tight rein the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has kept on the nation's money supply this year. That monetary policy has forced interest rates up in an effort to ease inflationary pressures by slowing business expansion. Recent economic data have indicated the economy is cooling down, but the inflation picture is more clouded. Sharp rises in wholesale and consumer prices earlier this year, along with a more recent surge in oil and gasoline prices, have prompted some economists to predict a new wave of strong inflation. The most pessimistic analysts see both recession and inflation ahead. But <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> foresees neither. In general, he said, the overall outlook `` is for modified growth and subdued inflationary tendencies.'' `` Put simply, I just do not believe that the preconditions for a sustained acceleration in inflation are now in place,'' he said. On the possibility of a recession, he added, `` the imbalances which traditionally precede a recession are not visible and indications are that the current expansion will continue.'' And on the inflation front, he said a second year of drought in the Corn Belt is unlikely and agricultural output should return to normal this year, bringing down food prices. Despite the rise in crude oil prices from about $ 17 to more than $ 20 a barrel since Jan. 1, `` recent history of the global oil market suggests that prices beyond $ 20 a barrel will probably not hold for long,'' <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said. Although economic growth is slowing, he said, the vigorous pace of corporate investment in plant and equipment expenditures is an encouraging sign, as is the promise of a bipartisan congressional agreement for the fiscal year 1990 federal budget. Reducing the federal budget deficit is essential for continued economic growth, <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said. `` Looking beyond the coming year, it is important that this progress will be sustained in future years as well until fiscal responsibility is again the norm.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is an international network of more than 20,000 senior business executives.

<HEAD>Helicopter Company Announces 450 Layoffs, More to Come</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MESA, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says a slowdown in attack helicopter production is to blame for the planned layoff of 450 workers this month, with about the same number to follow next year. President <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Tuesday that temporary and regular employees in all divisions would be cut, including 355 at the company's <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> plant and 95 at its plant in <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said those affected would be told by May 12 They will receive severance pay and help from the company in finding new jobs, he said. The layoffs and budget cutbacks, which will include cuts in such areas as advertising and marketing, are expected to save the company about $ 16 million this year, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. One of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s largest defense contractors, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> has 5,000 employees at its plant in <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> and another 3,000 in <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The company has been building about 10 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters a month, but the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has ordered that rate cut back to six a month beginning in June 1990. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> has delivered about 460 Apaches on a contract which called for 975. But President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said two weeks ago in unveiling his defense cuts that the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> now wants only 807, a drop of 168. It also builds the MD-500 series of light helicopters and a variety of automatic cannons. `` Due to the two-year length of the production pipeline, we are already feeling the dropoff in Apache labor required to build the reduced number of helicopters,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The company may be forced to lay off another 450 employees in <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> next year if efforts to further broaden the company's business base fall short, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. About 50 percent of the company's payroll has been based on Apache sales, the company has said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> referred to `` encouraging signs that point toward Apache sales as early as this year in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' He said, however, no contracts had been signed. `` Nothing counts until someone signs on the dotted line,'' he said. Supporters of the Apache contend that reductions in nuclear weapons, particularly in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, have made the anti-tank helicopter more important than ever. However, the Apache suffered a major setback earlier this year when the commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 82nd <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, complained that it was unreliable. He said all 12 of the Apaches in his unit were incapacitated at points during a war exercise, and only five were in operating condition at the end. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> denied there is a problem with the Apache's reliability, emphasizing that difficulties experienced with keeping the helicopter flying during war games and training were not safety related. `` The Army has a shortfall of maintenance people,'' he said. Despite the layoffs, the company will continue to invest heavily in research and development as it pursues development of new, advanced, civilian and military helicopters, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` We're not going to compromise our future,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> plans to hire about 100 engineers and technical specialists this year to help with development of its seven-passenger MDX commercial helicopter and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed LHX scout-attack helicopter.

 <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has agreed to put his hostile $ 2.7 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' parent on hold in exchange for confidential information on the nation's fourth-largest airline Under an agreement announced Tuesday by the airline company and <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the oilman's offer will remain outstanding but he will postpone buying more <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> shares until June 30. Separately, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> leveraged buyout firm of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> indicated an interest in acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported today <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> formally told <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> of its interest in a bid, the Journal reported, quoting unidentified people familiar with the takeover battle. The notification came as part of a bidding procedure <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> had set up in response to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>'s proxy challenge, the Journal said. If <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> pursues a bid, it would be the firm's largest known buyout effort since it bought <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 25 billion in February, according to the Journal. Spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> refused comment on <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION>'s apparent interest, the newspaper said. <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION>'s disclosure came in response to a deadline set by <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s investment banker, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the Journal said Bidders will next get access to confidential company data as well as meetings with company management. In the the agreement reached Tuesday between <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> also agreed to stop soliciting shareholder proxies in an attempt to unseat the company's board of directors at the annual meeting set for May 15. Analysts generally agreed that it may put <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> in an improved position. `` I would assume that he is no longer hostile. He's been folded into the process,'' said analyst <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON> for Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board rejected <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' $ 90-a-share offer as financially inadequate. `` I think it puts him in a position to make an educated bid for the company. He's going to have access to information he did n't have before,'' <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON> said `` Who knows? Mr. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> may look at the information and run away from the deal.'' In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> said, `` The agreement affords Mr. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> the opportunity to participate in <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s process for exploring alternatives designed to enhance stockholder value. `` <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> will be treated on an equal basis with all other bidders in connection with the procedures which are established by <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> for bids in connection with a possible sale of the company,'' added a statement from <ORGANIZATION> Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION>, the company <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> formed to acquire <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> will be permitted to make its best bid to the board of directors for a negotiated acquisition after reviewing the non-public information,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Acquisition </PERSON> said. But it does n't mean <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> are on good terms, <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON> said. `` The psychology is he probably has n't won any friends at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> the way he has handled the deal. He's been aggressive, aggressively hostile to the board,'' the analyst said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the restrictions will end immediately if <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> announces the sale of the company or a non-sale alternative, including no transaction at all, before June 30. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> agreed to give him 10 days notice if it decides to pursue certain non-sale alternatives. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> shares closed Tuesday at $ 101.75 in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, down 25 cents. The Davis accord was announced after the market closed. From the beginning of the takeover battle, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> officials said they were willing to accept queries from every potential bidder willing to sign a confidentiality statement, <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON> said. `` I think effectively what it does is it takes <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> from the outside and moves him to the inside,'' he said. As for <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON> said, `` It saves them the proxy fight ... although I think it was a long shot for <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>.'' Under the agreement, all pending litigation between the parties will be put on hold. But <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he will continue his action in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> to overturn a Thursday order by state Commerce Commissioner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> that prohibits <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> shareholders from selling their <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> shares to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. Under the state's anti-takeover law, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> must explain how he would operate the airline company in light of the large sum he proposes to borrow to buy it. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has said he does not intend to sell the the airline's strategic assets, reduce payroll or move the headquarters from suburban <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>, but his lawyers have indicated he may refinance or sell <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> real estate, reduce travel agent commissions or change <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s in-flight service <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> contends disclosure of his specific plans for operating the airline, as <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> requested, would put him at a competitive disadvantage with other suitors.

 Nearly 90 countries agreed today to support a ban on ozone-destroying chemicals by the year 2000, but they split over how to help Third World countries pay for safer technology. Delegates from 86 countries and nearly 100 non-governmental organizations at the U.N.-sponsored conference adopted a resolution calling for industrial countries to help developing nations replace equipment emitting harmful chlorofluorocarbons. But it made no specific funding proposals. <PERSON> Mostafa </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolba </PERSON>, head of the U.N. Environment Program, proposed an international climate fund to help Third World countries comply with the program to phase out chemicals that deplete the earth's shield of ozone But industrial countries led by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> objected, favored a bilateral approach. British Environment Minister <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Tolba </PERSON>'s idea as `` simplistic. `` It has not been suggested who would run such a fund, how it would operate, on what criteria its funds would be raised, and from whom, and what would happen if they did not contribute,'' <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> told the conference. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, the only country to make a solid proposal, offered to contribute 0.1 percent of its gross national income _ about $ 88 million _ to the climate fund, if other industrial nations do the same. <PERSON> Tolba </PERSON> suggested a working group from the 48 countries that ratified the 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protocol </ORGANIZATION> draw up a specific funding plan and submit it next year. While politicians discussed finances, scientists questioned whether alternatives are at hand to replace the most harmful chemicals _ the chlorofluorocarbons used for refrigeration, insolvents and other industrial processes. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fay </PERSON>, of the Alliance for Responsible Chlorofluorocarbon Policy, said the <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protocol </ORGANIZATION> was based on the assumption the chemicals could be substituted by hydrochlorofluorocarbons and other new and presumably safer variations. The new compounds are the best known replacements, but `` we do n't know enough about them,'' <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> told reporters. `` They can not be used until we have the answers to questions for their safety for the environment,'' said <PERSON> Fay </PERSON>, whose alliance is a coalition of hundreds of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries cooperating in the search for alternatives. `` There's no way that the deadlines can be met'' if the new chemicals are found to be unusable, he said. Non-governmental organizations said Tuesday's declaration `` does not go far enough,'' according to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. They called for a `` crash program'' to eliminate the chemicals by 1995. The four-day conference, the First Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, was to update the 1987 document requiring signatories to halve by 1999 their production of five chlorofluorocarbons and three halons, which break down ozone and increase the risk of skin cancers and eye disease. Annual chlorofluorocarbon production is 1.14 million tons, two-thirds of which is produced by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> produces 12 percent and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> about 10 percent.

<HEAD>Reports 7 Percent Drop In Quarterly Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAK BROOK, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest mail-order retailer, Wednesday reported its first-quarter profit fell 7.4 percent, largely due to the costs of acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Eddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bauer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Honeybee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The Oak Brook-based company said its after-tax income totaled $ 6.34 million, or 12 cents a share, in the three months ended March 31, down from $ 6.85 million, or 15 cents a share, for the same period a year before. Revenue for the quarter amounted to $ 324.5 million, a 37 percent increase over $ 236.7 million in the first quarter of 1988. Operating income rose 13 percent, to $ 24.2 million from $ 21.4 million, <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> said in an prepared announcement about its financial results. The company said it paid about $ 6 million, before taxes, in interest during the quarter to finance its purchases of <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, a mail-order sportswear and outdoor-equipment company, and Honeybee, a chain of women's apparel stores. Both acquisitions were announced in 1988. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON>, <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>'s president and chief executive, said the company's profit margin on net sales rose to 33.2 percent from 32.7 percent in 1988's first quarter. He attributed the improvement to a lower level of goods sold at marked-down prices, a result of better inventory management. `` The outlook for the coming months is promising,'' <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> stated. `` Apparel sales have strengthened and home furnishings remain strong. We are well-positioned to continue to fulfill our customers' needs in both of these areas.''

 <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said today it has submitted a proposal to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' Northeast shuttle and 10 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757 planes for $ 726 million in a deal that would top an offer from developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. The aggressive regional carrier based in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> stated it would pay $ 390 million cash for the shuttle. Eastern already has agreed to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s $ 365 million bid for the profitable <ORGANIZATION> Boston-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-Washington </ORGANIZATION> shuttle, plus 17 smaller, older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s. However, all sales of Eastern assets must be approved by the federal bankruptcy court overseeing the airline's Chapter 11 reorganization. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> said it submitted the proposal as part of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy proceedings <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON>, president of Trump Shuttle _ the name the developer plans to use for the shuttle _ said, `` We have no comment. We do n't know anything about it,'' referring to the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> proposal. However, he said, `` We have a signed contract with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>.'' Eastern filed for protection from creditors five days after its Machinists, pilots and flight attendants unions walked off the job March 4. The airline began moving ahead with plans to sell $ 1.8 billion in assets and rebuild on a much smaller scale after attempts to sell the entire company collapsed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> has pushed to have <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> sold in its entirety and scheduled a hearing today for arguments over why such an auction should not take place.

<HEAD>Farmers Face Plowing Under Winter-Killed Wheat Crop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wind and cold killed up to 95 percent of the winter wheat planted in northern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and many farmers are returning to their fields to plow under the winter crop and plant spring wheat. One third of the state's winter wheat acreage has losses of at least 80 percent, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The northern tier counties that are the heart of the state's wheat country, producing premium hard red winter wheat, were hard hit. `` The further north you get, the worse it gets,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> winter wheat breeder. West of the Continental Divide, where cheaper soft white winter wheat is grown in northern counties, crop losses are estimated at 95 percent to 98 percent. `` The old-timers say it's the severest winterkill they've ever seen,'' said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MGGA </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president. Despite possibly the worst wipeout in state winter wheat history, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Christianson </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said farmers generally are optimistic because of the simultaneous return of wet weather and good prices _ the highest wheat prices in eight years. `` It's raining,'' he said. `` They're living under entirely different conditions than last year. ... They are really upbeat. I'm sure it's weather-and price-related.'' Still, the kill was extensive. An <ORGANIZATION> MGGA </ORGANIZATION> survey indicates that drought stress last fall and extreme winds and cold over the winter killed 95 percent of the winter wheat in <LOCATION> Toole </LOCATION>, Liberty, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> counties and northern <LOCATION> Chouteau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Chouteau </LOCATION> counties are <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s biggest winter-wheat producers, accounting for more than one-fifth of the state's acreage normally planted to winter wheat <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said a survey of members from throughout the state found 90 percent crop loss in <LOCATION> Blaine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> and northern <LOCATION> Pondera </LOCATION> counties, 80 percent loss in <LOCATION> Blaine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and 70 percent in <PERSON> McCone </PERSON> and northern Fergus counties. Normally, a 25 percent winterkill is considered severe in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. The first official government report on winterkill and prospective production totals for 1989 wo n't be released until May 11. The winter was so severe that it killed many perennial alfalfa stands, said <ORGANIZATION> MSU </ORGANIZATION> legume breeder <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditterline </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said that when winterkill exceeds 90 percent in winter wheat, farmers wo n't take a chance on the remaining winter wheat and instead will plow up the entire crop and plant spring wheat, barley or other spring-sown crops. <PERSON> Christianson </PERSON> said his conservative guess is that farmers will have to re-plant at least 1.1 million of the 2 million acres they had put into winter wheat last fall. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s wheat acreage has been divided about evenly between winter and spring varieties, but this year's harvest may be as much as three-fourths spring wheat _ which yields about five bushels per acre below winter but usually brings slightly better prices. The re-seeding puts an extra burden on farmers, as crop insurance does not pay re-seeding costs when winter wheat does n't make it Also, insurance policies on winter wheat are carried over to re-planted spring wheat _ but the pay-off level is based on potentially lower yields

 Striking <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> resumed picketing today after union and <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> officials agreed to sit down with federal mediators but disagreed on a seven-day cooling-off period. By midmorning the picket lines remained peaceful, unlike Tuesday when strikers pelted company coal trucks with rocks. Several miners and truck drivers were injured. Also Tuesday, 125 demonstrators were arrested at the company's Moss No 3 coal preparation plant at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>. Those arrested, some of them miners' wives, sat in front of plant entrances to block coal trucks. They were charged with trespassing, a misdemeanor, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Lt. C.F. <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON>. About 1,500 miners in southwestern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> have been on strike since April 5. The miners had been working without a contract since February 1988. The mediation agreement was announced Tuesday in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said the union was committed to bargaining around the clock beginning immediately for seven days. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> also suggested a seven-day cooling off period during which <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> would cease production and the union halt its demonstrations. But <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said he did not want his company, a division of the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, to be bound by a seven-day period for mediation. `` We strongly believe ... the mediator assigned to the dispute should have some opportunity to become familiar with the very complicated issues involved,'' he said. <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> also said he saw no reason for a cooling-off period. `` Lawful and peaceful picketing is not an impediment to the process. It is the union's violence that brings disruption to the coalfield communities,'' he said. The injuries occurred at a coal processing plant near McClure, where coal trucks were being driven by workers from <ORGANIZATION> Jamb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> under contract to <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> said troopers told him the injured strikers were in a parked vehicle that was hit by a coal truck when the driver attempted to flee `` a hailstorm of rocks thrown by miners.'' But miner <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said about 20 miners were standing around watching the coal trucks drive around a tree downed in the road when the driver of an escort vehicle rammed into the crowd. `` He done his best to run over all he could,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, nursing supervisor at <ORGANIZATION> Russell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said five strikers were treated there and released and two others were admitted.

<HEAD>Travelers Earnings Jump 48.5 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Travelers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday its earnings rose 48.5 percent in spite of a decline in revenue in the first quarter. The insurer said net income rose to $ 98 million, or 96 cents a share, on revenue of $ 3.2 billion, from $ 66 million, or 60 cents a share, on revenue of $ 3.3 billion in the same period a year ago. First-quarter results included net realized investment gains of $ 1 million, compared to realized investment losses of $ 11 million in the first quarter of 1988. The Travelers restated prior results to reflect a new accounting standard. The change resulted in a reduction in reported earnings of $ 7 million in the first quarter of 1989 and $ 6 million in the first quarter of 1988. Under the change, universal life and investment-type contracts are no longer included in premiums and current and future benefits, and realized investment gains and losses are now included in pretax income. `` First-quarter earnings benefited from the continued turnaround in Employee Benefits and improvements in our noninsurance subsidiaries,'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a written statement. Net investment income for the first quarter was $ 869 million, compared to $ 941 million for the same period a year ago. Premiums were $ 2 billion for the quarter, compared to $ 2.1 billion a year ago. Assets at the end of the first quarter were $ 53.9 billion, compared to $ 55 billion a year ago. The decreases reflected the divestiture of some businesses in 1988, the company said.

 Car and light truck sales by the nation's Big Three automakers in late April dropped 3 percent, compared with the same period a year ago when sales were moderately strong, the companies said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said they sold cars and light trucks at an average daily rate of 41,487 during the April 21-30 period this year compared with a rate of 42,772 during the same time last year. A 6.2 percent drop in car sales was offset partially by a 2.7 percent increase in light truck sales by the Big Three. For the entire month, when each of the companies offered wide-ranging incentive packages, car and truck sales were up 6.3 percent this year over last April. For the year through April, vehicle sales were down 5.7 percent compared with the same period last year. The companies have been looking closely at sales results after the usually strong March and April buying season got off to a slow start. The incentives are aimed at boosting vehicle sales, which sagged below expectations during the first three months of the year, and at forestalling production cuts later in the year. However, analysts have said they expected the companies to trim their production rates during the second half of the year, mainly through extended model-changeover times during the late summer and early fall. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales suffered the most during late April, running 7.4 percent behind last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s cars sold at an average daily rate of 7,980 this year, compared with a rate of 8,619 during the period last year. For the month, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales were up 12.9 percent, and through the first four months of this year, car sales were 0.1 percent over last year's pace. The company's light trucks sold in late April at a rate 6.2 percent below the same period last year and through the first four months of the year sold 2.9 percent under the pace of a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said its car sales were off 6.1 percent in late April, going to a daily rate of 13,666 this year from a rate of 14,560 last year. Sales for the entire month were up 1.2 percent this year, and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> car sales since Jan. 1 were off 10.7 percent.

<HEAD>Honesty Tests Increasingly Used To Identify Undesirable Workers</HEAD>

 The interview went well, but before <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> got his clerk's job at a Stop' N Go store in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, he had to spend an hour taking a test aimed at determining whether he's a liar, thief or substance abuser. It was n't the first time. In the past two years, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, 26, had been asked by three prospective employers to submit to a paper-and-pencil grilling about whether he'd used drugs or stolen any money or merchandise. His experience reflects a nationwide quest to create a drug-free, theft-free workplace, which has increased employer use of honesty and integrity tests designed to identify potential problem workers. `` They told me they give the survey to everyone before they hire them, basically to screen you,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said of Stop' N Go, which hired him in March. `` I did n't think too much about it _ I know I'm a good person and should screen well. But critics complain the tests amount to a written version of a lie-detector or polygraph exam, violate privacy, are n't scientific and encourage lazy hiring practices. Some contend the tests can be designed to detect political beliefs or union sympathies. Others fear honest applicants mistakenly will be denied jobs, although test creators warn against using their questions as the sole determinant of employment because the tests are n't 100 percent foolproof. Many businesses have reason to suspect workers. Government and private estimates suggest substance abuse costs about $ 177 billion a year in absenteeism, lower productivity, lower work-quality and higher benefits costs, while employee theft accounts for estimated losses of $ 40 billion a year. Honesty tests range in cost from $ 6 to $ 15 each, including an evaluation of the results by the test creators. For identifying drug abusers, they are becoming an attractive alternative to urine tests, which can cost up to $ 50 each, are often considered unreliable and face growing legal challenges. A law that took effect in December barring most private employers from administering polygraph tests also gave written honesty tests a boost. `` As soon as polygraph testing was banned, a bunch of entrepreneurs got in the act and developed tests that do not specifically violate any laws and act against other mechanical forms of testing,'' said <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The first honesty or integrity tests were developed in the 1960s by a company now called <ORGANIZATION> Reid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, but their use has multiplied in the past few years. In 1986, an estimated 2.3 million honesty tests were administered; the number is expected to jump to 5.5 million by next year. The tests are surprisingly straightforward. They might ask whether the applicant has ever stolen anything from an employer, or how many times in the past month the applicant has used drugs. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rognas </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> franchisee with five stores in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, for the past two years has required applicants to take an honesty test. Results are startling. <PERSON> Rognas </PERSON> said his food costs have dropped about 4 percent because employees are n't stealing, and labor costs are down the same amount as efficiency improved. `` We hired one guy without the test and asked him to take it later. He failed, and we ended up firing him because he was stealing. It works,'' <PERSON> Rognas </PERSON> said. The nationwide crusade against drugs is considered a major catalyst pushing employers into the nebulous frontier of employee privacy. `` A lot of this stuff would not be possible were it not for ... the drug scare that exists,'' <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said. `` People are willing to sacrifice some very fundamental rights'' of privacy. With the federal government conceding the drug problem's awesome magnitude, some experts say a `` policing function'' has been shifted to business. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said employee testing represents `` the privatization of law enforcement.'' Who would admit to drug abuse or theft? <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Lousig-Nont </PERSON>, whose Las Vegas-based company develops and markets honesty tests, said he continually is surprised at how forthright applicants are about past transgressions. Of 10,723 people applying for work at a national convenience store chain that took his test last year, 777 admitted to having shoplifted a total of $ 26,190 in merchandise, 902 said they think about shoplifting, and 290 admitted having stolen $ 67,579 in merchandise from previous jobs. Of 10,440 people tested for the same company, 1,142 admitted to overdrinking, 739 said they used cocaine and 37 said they sold amphetamines. Questions are designed to prevent a person who used marijuana once 5 years ago from being lumped into the same `` risk'' category as one who sold cocaine last week, <PERSON> Lousig-Nont </PERSON> said. Experts say some people confess outright because it describes behavior that has become normal for them. Others are likely to be tripped up by questions that probe attitudes toward stealing and taking drugs. Employees have no recourse but to submit to testing, even though experts say court challenges to the tests are inevitable. `` If you do n't take it, they wo n't hire you, and there's nothing you can do about it. That's the bottom line,'' the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said. The vast majority of people do n't object. Reid Psychological statistics showed 92 percent of test takers accepted the test while only 3 percent resented it and the rest had no opinion. `` They're user-friendly, uncomplicated and non-stressful,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrie </PERSON>, an assistant professor at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Often people are told it's just part of the screening process,'' he said. `` They're very revealing _ an individual that could never ask about integrity in a face-to-face interview gets -LRB- information -RRB- from people who quite willingly provide it.'' Nonetheless, the tests are coming under scrutiny. Last October the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> requested a study on the tests' validity and the ethical implications of their widespread use. The study, conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION>, is expected to be completed this summer. Committee member Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Mont., said the tests are epitomized by a country-western song that goes, `` If you hang ` em all, you get the guilty. Businesses, particularly small ones, `` appear to find it easier to throw a very wide net than to specifically try to do legitimate and appropriate personnel screening,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` Paper-and-pencil tests may not be valid, but they're a hell of a lot cheaper than personnel departments.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is studying whether the tests conform to research standards, since virtually all test studies have been conducted by the companies that sell them. `` The publishers say the tests are valid 80 percent of the time ... there seems to be some skepticism, but basically the jury's still out,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Camara </PERSON>, the association's director of scientific affairs

 Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, with wheat prices up strongly following the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> announcement of additional subsidized grain sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Wheat opened lower at the start of trading, surprising the market, which expected a strong start for wheat futures. `` There were a lot of people who thought the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> business was already reflected in prices,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Feltes </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Today's action showed that any kind of business outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be positive'' for the market. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has agreed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will sell 1.5 million metric tons of wheat to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The announcement of the sale was made Tuesday. Soybean futures rallied after mid-session, helped along by continued strength in May soybean demand. `` With farmer preoccupation with field work, there is not a lot soybeans moving to processors or to exporting channels,'' <PERSON> Feltes </PERSON> said. Corn was up modestly, with fairly good rains in Western corn producing states weighing heavily on the market. Wheat closed 1 cent to 11 cents higher with the contract for May delivery at $ 4.37 -LCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 2 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 2.76 a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 2 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 1.87 cents a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to 13 cents higher with May at $ 7.47 a bushel.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar closed narrowly mixed in light European trading Wednesday. Gold prices rose. Foreign exchange dealers said that on the eve of the Ascension Day holiday, when most European markets will be closed, the dollar held firm despite intervention by central banks, including the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. The central banks have been acting concertedly for days to sell dollars to keep the currency's exchange rate down. One <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealer said the dollar's firm tone reflected investor buying but others wondered how long the dollar can continue to resist central banks' intervention. Dealers said the dollar's short-term direction could be determined by the release on Friday of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figures for April, an indication of the condition of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy last month. While markets in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> were closed for the Constitution Day holiday, the dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, trading late at 133.93 yen, up from Tuesday's closing 133.85 yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.6847 late Wednesday, more expensive for buyers than Tuesday's late $ 1.6845. Other late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared to Tuesday's late rates: 1.8900 West German marks, up from 1.8875; 1.6830 Swiss francs, up from 1.6805; 6.3725 French francs, down from 6.3735; 2.1270 Dutch guilders, unchanged; 1,379.20 Italian lire, down from 1,379.50; and 1.1830 Canadian dollars, unchanged Gold bullion gained nearly $ 2 in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, The late bid price was $ 379.00 a troy ounce, up from $ 377.30 late Tuesday. The late bid price in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was $ 377.95 an ounce, up from $ 377.50. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at $ 376.55 an ounce, up from $ 375.95. Silver bullion traded late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 5.65 a troy ounce, unchanged.

<HEAD>Administration Renews Threat to Veto Minimum Wage Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The White House said Wednesday that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will veto compromise legislation worked out by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to raise the mimimum wage from $ 3.35 to $ 4.55 an hour by 1991. Reacting to Tuesday's agreement between <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators on legislation to change the wage rate for the first time in eight years, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continues to believe the figure is too high. `` The president's position is the same, and he reiterated that'' during a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators, the spokesman said. `` His first proposal -LRB- for a $ 4.25 top rate -RRB- was his last proposal. ... He is prepared to veto the bill if they send it up.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stance sets up the first showdown on domestic policy involving the new president and the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> several weeks ago told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> there were enough <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> supporters of his position to sustain a veto. An override of a presidential veto requires two-thirds of those present and voting in both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Senate Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would hold to his earlier promise to veto the bill. `` I just want to set the record straight _ the president will not yield on this,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. In reaching consensus on a final bill so swiftly, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, Democrats pushing the legislation `` in effect asked for a confrontation with the president.'' It took less than an hour Tuesday for the conferees to complete their work, thanks in large part to staff negotiations conducted during last week's congressional recess. Also contributing to the speedy resolution was that the major elements of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills were the same. Each called for raising the hourly minimum wage from $ 3.35 to $ 4.55 by October 1991 and for allowing employers to pay some new workers a subminimum training wage for two months. On the subminimum, the final product contains language very close to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version, allowing employers to pay new hires 85 percent of the minimum wage if the newcomers have not held a job for more than 60 days. Once an individual held a job for 60 days, he or she would never again be eligible to be paid the training wage. The legislation could reach the White House within two weeks, after passage by the separate houses. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said $ 4.25 an hour is the highest minimum he will accept, and even that support hinges on a six-month subminimum that could be paid to all new hires regardless of past job experience. Democrats sponsoring the legislation said they were prepared to confront <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with the measure and would attempt to override his expected veto, although they concede <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> currently has more than enough votes to stymie an override effort.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> once earned a living by artfully whacking a little ball across expansive green lawns and sandy gullies, seldom thinking about the battles with <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Nature </PERSON> that go into golf course designs. Now that he's switched from pro to proprietor, he thinks of little else. Today, <ORGANIZATION> Jim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colbert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> owns or operates 14 public and private golf courses from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, with the number expected to expand into the 20s by the end of the year. <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> is rolling now, but he's learned the hard way that weather can make or break a good golf operation. `` This whole business evolves around water,'' <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON>, 48, said in an interview. `` You may be plagued with too much or too little. Once a course is built, the only thing left is drainage, drainage, drainage _ whether it's yours or the Lord's. `` With our courses in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, the problem is too much water. In <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, it's too little.'' The exception was in 1984, when a rare <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> flood swamped a course where <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON>'s fledgling company had spent $ 1 million in remodeling work. `` It took $ 1.5 million and two years to fix it up,'' <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> said of damage to the old county-run <ORGANIZATION> Winterwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Course </ORGANIZATION>. `` That was our welcome to the golf course business.'' Today <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON>'s company has 500 employees at courses in nine states. <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> credits a bad back and a decade of duty on the 10-member PGA Tour Policy Board with nudging him into the golf course business. He served with the leaders of giant corporations, learning how to build companies and golf courses. By the time he left the board in 1984, the organization had built 12 TPC -LRB- The Players Club -RRB- courses. The courses are used as a PGA tournament course once a year, and the remainder of the year as public or private courses. They are operated by the PGA tour and `` are very good profit centers for the tour,'' <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> said. `` Being involved in the building of these courses peeked my interest in golf courses,'' <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> recalled. <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> won his first pro title in 1969. By the time nagging back problems forced him to the sidelines 18 years later, he had won eight tournaments and more than $ 1.5 million in prize money. `` I did n't play half the time,'' <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> said of a four-year span beginning in 1976, when the back problems intensified. `` It looked like my career was over.'' A native of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> grew up in the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Prairie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION> and attended <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on a football scholarship from 1959 to 1964, honing his golf skills as well. He called on old friend <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogler </PERSON>, who'd run the <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> for 23 years, when he cut a deal with the city of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> to take over the city course in 1981. `` I'd been a touring pro,'' <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> said. `` I did n't know much about the operational end of things.'' <PERSON> Fogler </PERSON>, who had twice served as <ORGANIZATION> PGA </ORGANIZATION> vice president, took over the management of the company, concentrating on construction and remodeling of courses. He remains a key to the company's operations, utilizing four decades of expertise in the golf course business The company took on its second project in 1983, <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Winterwood </LOCATION> course It spent $ 1 million remodeling the course, located on the east side of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. A disastrous flood that swamped Las Vegas in 1984 caused $ 1.5 million damage to the course, and left a two-year rebuilding challenge. `` The second one almost killed us,'' <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> said. `` We had to get No. 3 -LRB- <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> -RRB-, No. 4 -LRB- <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dimas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> -RRB- and No. 5 -LRB- <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> -RRB- to pay for No. 2. It was kind of like <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s Law took over. Whatever could go wrong did.'' Today <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON>'s company owns or operates courses in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. He declined to give a dollar value of his company. Besides long hours in his Las Vegas office and trips around the country checking out new course opportunities, he also serves as sportcaster analyst for the <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION> at 18 golf tournaments a year. `` We look for problems,'' <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> said his search for new properties. `` We look for shortcomings. If we can identify and solve them, we're a serious buyer. We think more of a product, many times, than the people who own it. `` The art of this trade is buying something and making a profit. We'll take a bad facility as long as we know we can make it better.'' Did he ever dream he'd be a major player in the golf course business? `` I wish I could say I was that smart, but too many people know me,'' <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> laughed. `` I saw a tiny hole and I went through that door.''

<HEAD>Wall Street Firms in New Round of Post-Crash Cutbacks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Eighteen months after the stock market crashed and took thousands of jobs with it, Wall Street still is feeling the aftershocks. Investor mistrust and high interest rates have triggered a recession in the securities industry, forcing a second wave of cutbacks at firms awash in profits in the mid-1980s. Despite rising prices that have pushed many stocks to post-crash highs, securities firms have reported weak first-quarter earnings or outright losses and slashed payrolls by about 2,600 workers in the last month. The cutbacks have pushed Wall Street layoffs to more than 25,000 since the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 508 points on Oct. 19, 1987, the largest single-day decline in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> history. `` At long last after a year of much lower levels of profitability, they realized they have to take the bulls by the horns and do something,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Perrin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's just like when you and I get a toothache, we take a day or two before we go see the dentist.'' The staff reductions are blamed on slow business in all segments, from low volume on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, to a dive in stock and bond underwriting, to declining merger activity. They also represent what Wall Street strategists like to call a `` correction'' _ a counter-reaction to a hiring frenzy from 1982 to 1987 in which securities firms expanded by 20 percent to 30 percent annually and fresh-faced business-school graduates made six-figure salaries. `` Some firms expanded a couple years ago like it was never going to end,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckenfelder </PERSON>, who follows Wall Street for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` There's too much capacity and we're going through this painful retraction.'' Business is so bad that the Wall Street Journal, diary of the financial world, recently published a five-part series titled `` Wall Street's Recession,'' illustrated by cobwebs on a street sign in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Some symptoms of Wall Street's malaise: _ Total employment by NYSE-member brokerages has fallen from a peak of 262,100 employees in September 1987 to about 236,000 today, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade association of brokerages The firms had hired more than 100,000 workers from the end of 1981 to the crash. _ Average daily trading volume on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> was 159 million shares in March, compared with a 1987 average of nearly 189 million shares and 1988 average of about 162 million shares _ Merger activity, an important source of business for Wall Street, has fallen to its lowest level in more than two years, according to <ORGANIZATION> IDD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial reporting service In the first quarter of 1989, 708 deals worth $ 49.6 billion were completed, vs. 996 deals worth $ 101.7 billion in the previous quarter, IDD figures show. Even discounting last year's $ 25 billion <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> buyout, the biggest takeover in history, the value of completed deals was off about 25 percent. _ Fees generated by underwriting new issues of corporate stocks and bonds have plummeted In the first quarter of 1989, 305 new issues generated fees of $ 554.7 million, less than half the 692 new issues and fees of $ 1.35 billion in the same 1988 period, according to <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is selling its entire retail brokerage division of 2,300 workers, partly because of its bad image from an insider trading scandal but more from generally bad business Further large cuts are expected in <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> bond units. <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> laid off 200 employees, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> dropped 30 professionals and <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reportedly has let go dozens of bond traders. Analysts forecast another 5,000 to 10,000 layoffs in coming months. `` We are in the midst of a very serious, chronic crisis,'' <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutfreund </PERSON>, whose firm lost $ 28 million in the first quarter, told a recent meeting sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> Some analysts said the public also has learned from the 1987 crash _ which Wall Streeters euphemistically have taken to calling a `` market break'' _ the lesson that the volatile nature of the market may not be worth the risk. With yields of 9 percent or more on money market funds and certificates of deposit, individual investors are steering clear of the riskier stock market. But for securities firms, commissions on money market investments made for customers are far lower than for stocks. `` Now we're just not addressing the issue of overcapacity. Now the revenues just are n't coming in,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a midsized <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> securities firm. Overall, <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON> said commission-generated revenues are down about 35 percent across the board. `` The public has generally decided to stay on the sidelines and take advantage of the high yields with the minimum amount of risk,'' he said. `` If you can get 9 or 10 percent on a risk-free basis, there's no point for someone with limited resources to speculate in the stock market.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloonan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the average stock holding among the 105,000 members of his organization has fallen 6 percent in the last two years, to about 29 percent of portfolios. `` The industry just kept spinning on their best day and best month and that's not how the world works,'' he said. But if business is so bad, why have some stock-market price barometers reached post-crash highs, with the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average poking through the 2,400 mark? Analysts attribute the rise to a strong dollar luring foreign investment into the market and to cautious trading by investors still participating. Also, they said recent corporate mergers and takeovers have sharply increased the value of some stocks. A still-strong economy has put corporate earnings about where they should be, analysts said. But without large numbers of transactions, Wall Street's firms do n't necessarily profit. Higher rent and salary costs from the boom days also have hurt securities firms. `` There is less volume in firms that have higher overheads,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief economist with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` They find their profit margins on each trade are even lower than before. Ouch! Ouch!''

<HEAD>Late Buying Surge Sends Oil Futures Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Crude oil and wholesale home heating oil futures finished higher Wednesday, lifted by a late spurt of buying on news that the disruption in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil production will last longer than than previously expected. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, gained 30 cents to settle at $ 20.10 a barrel, after a loss of 86 cents on Tuesday. Heating oil for June delivery was buoyed by the crude oil buying and ended the session up 0.25 cent at 47.86 cents a gallon. The contract had slipped 1.85 cents in the previous session. Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the June contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline settled 1.86 cents lower at 69.39 cents a gallon following Tuesday's loss of 1.36 cents. Market participants were in a selling mood for much of the day and prices were weak. But, as the session was drawing to a close, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said repairs on its Cormorant Alpha platform in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> were likely to take longer than anticipated, delaying the resumption of operations until later this month. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s platform was damaged by an explosion April 18, causing the shutdown of a transportation and production system for Brent crude, a key international grade of crude oil. The disruption has taken about 470,000 barrels a day off the world crude market. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> said that May 26 was a reasonable date on which to expect operations to return to normal but a resumption could take place as early as May 18. There had been speculation in the market that the resumption might occur next week. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON>, an energy broker at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said crude and heating oil futures also derived strength from continued selling in the gasoline futures pits. Gasoline prices had been bid steadily higher recently in anticipation of possible shortages due to the Exxon oil spill off the Alaskan coast in March and the seasonal increase in demand. <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON> said trading volume Wednesday was moderate.

 The dollar firmed Wednesday against most major currencies in quiet worldwide trading even though central banks intervened to push down its value. Gold prices moved higher. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a troy ounce of gold bullion at $ 377.40 as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $ 1.05 from late Tuesday. Currency dealers said reported dollar selling by a handful of central banks, including the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, failed to dampen the market's overriding bullish sentiment toward the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. `` At best you can say it's holding the dollar from going higher,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` What we have here is a confrontation between the market and the central banks.'' Worldwide demand for the dollar has been high in recent weeks due to the continued strength of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy and relatively high American interest rates, which make dollar-denominated investments more attractive. Some dealers said the short-term direction of the dollar could be determined later this week, with Friday's release of April unemployment data. The markets were closed Wednesday in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for the Constitution Day holiday. But in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen, trading at 133.93 yen, up from Tuesday's closing 133.85 yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Later, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 134.295 yen from 134.275 Tuesday. Most European markets will be closed on Thursday for the the Ascension Day holiday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.6847, more expensive for buyers than Tuesday's late $ 1.6845. Sterling fetched $ 1.6820 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from $ 1.68055. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> compared to Tuesday's rates, included: 1.89325 West German marks, up from 1.8919; 1.68705 Swiss francs, up from 1.68425; 1.18415 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18125; 6.3905 French francs, down from 6.3950; and 1,383.05 Italian lire, down from 1,383.25.

On the Comex in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery rose to $ 378.40 a troy ounce from $ 377.80 Tuesday.

 Indicted financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> was honored Wednesday for multimillion-dollar donations to charity at a celebrity-studded lunch sponsored by a group that helps children. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, who lost his job as top bond trader for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> because of his alleged role in a staggering securities-fraud scandal, was praised as one who gives unstintingly _ not just with money but his own time. He also has become a personal friend of many children aided by the H.E.L.P. group, said the organization's founder, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> is the kind of guy who is always giving and not demanding anything in return,'' Ms. <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> said at the lunch. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, one of the nation's most dynamic and wealthy financiers, was indicted March 29 on 98 federal counts of racketeering, fraud and stock manipulation stemming largely from the confessions of now-imprisoned insider trader <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. Charged along with <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> are his brother, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> trader <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Wheat Prices Respond To Soviet Grain Purchase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, with wheat prices up strongly following the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> announcement of additional subsidized grain sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. On other markets, cotton prices rose, energy futures were mostly higher, livestock futures were up and pork futures were mixed. Precious metals also were mixed. Wheat settled 1 cent to 11 cents higher with the contract for May delivery at $ 4.37 -LCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 2 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 2.76 a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 2 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 1.87 cents a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to 12 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 7.46 -RCB- a bushel. Wheat opened lower at the start of trading, surprising a market that expected a strong start for wheat futures. `` There were a lot of people who thought the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> business was already reflected in prices,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Feltes </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Today's action showed that any kind of business outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be positive'' for the market. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration announced Tuesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will sell 1.5 million metric tons of wheat to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under the export bonus program. Soybeans futures rallied after mid-sesssion, helped along by continued strength in May soybean demand. `` With farmer preoccupation with field work, there is not a lot of soybeans moving to processors or to exporting channels,'' <PERSON> Feltes </PERSON> said. Corn was up modestly, with fairly good rains in Western corn-producing states weighing heavily on the market. Cotton futures prices rose sharply on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on reports of severe damage to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s cotton crop. The rally also was stimulated by commission house and local buying, said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, a cotton specialist for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> suffered losses in crops and livestock following four days of heavy rain and snow. `` This particular <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> problem has been with us for two weeks,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. `` But the news services have just begun to point it out and strengthened new crop orders.'' Cotton settled 1.04 cents to 1.33 cents higher with May at 66.33 cents a pound. Energy futures were mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as gasoline prices came under pressure in the wake of a <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> report of increased imports. `` People were taking profits,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritterbusch </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Crude was off in sympathy with gasoline prices early in the session, but rebounded. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 30 cents to 49 cents higher with June at $ 20.10 a barrel; heating oil was 1.34 cents lower to .41 cent higher with June at 47.86 a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.86 cents lower to .89 cent higher with June at 69.39 cents a gallon. Livestock prices were higher and pork futures were mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Cattle futures rose as higher cash prices were reported at recent stock auctions. Hogs were mixed on continued light demand, although warehouses were doing a some buying, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Live cattle settled .25 cent to .50 cent higher with June at 72.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower to .97 cent higher with May at 76.55 a pound; hogs were .02 cent lower to .25 cent higher with June at 47.22 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .58 cent lower to .10 cent higher with May at 30.82 cents a pound. Gold and silver futures were mixed in quiet trading on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` The firm dollar was a negative,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Demler </PERSON>, a metals economist for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, adding the market is waiting for new economic data due out later this week. Gold settled $ 3.60 lower to 60 cents higher, with May at $ 378.40 a troy ounce; silver was .1 cent lower to 1.8 cents higher with May at $ 5.635 a troy ounce.

Wednesday said it has filed a complaint against <ORGANIZATION> May </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> over a disagreement related to <PERSON> May </PERSON>'s purchase of <PERSON> Filene </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s from <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> The complaint, filed by <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, seeks a judgment on whether the purchase agreement between the retailers provides for certain adjustments in the amount of money May paid for Boston-based Filene's and Houston-based <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s department stores. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, a Canadian company that has real estate and retail holdings including strings of department stores in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said the amount of the adjustments in dispute is about $ 47 million. Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said May has until May 18 to respond to the complaint, which was disclosed in a filing to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. It was filed in the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> court on April 20. A spokesman at May's headquarters in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> said the company was disappointed that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> filed the complaint instead of seeking a solution to their disagreement through arbitration. `` We previously advised <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> of the need for arbitration of our mutual disagreements in the purchase price adjustments both for the <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Filene </PERSON>'s transactions ...,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> sold the Filene's and <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s operations to May about a year ago for $ 1.53 billion at the time <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> acquired Cincinnati-based Federated.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday its first-quarter loss widened to $ 151.1 million from $ 83.3 million a year earlier, due in part to the bombing of its Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, in December. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said the attack on Flight 103, in which 270 people were killed, raised passenger concern about terrorism, and led to a 16 percent drop in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> traffic at the corporation's main subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. Revenue from the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shuttle </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> jumped 46.4 percent to $ 59.9 million from $ 40.9 million, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said. The shuttle benefited from the troubles at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which culminated with a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> strike near the end of the quarter. The parent company reported $ 733.5 million in revenue for the first three months of 1989, down from $ 763.9 million a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, which has suffered losses for several years, said its labor expenses increased despite cost-cutting contracts with its unions. However, the company said that aside from the drop in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> traffic its results were about as expected.

 <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is discussing with `` several parties'' the possible sale of assets of its defunct <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> supercomputer subsidiary, the president told shareholders Wednesday. `` In the case of <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, we are currently meeting with customers and vendors,'' President <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> said at <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting `` We are also in very preliminary discussions with several parties to attempt to sell <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> assets and technology.'' If <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> tries to sell <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> assets to a Japanese company, some analysts say it would raise concerns in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that valuable <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology would be handed over to a foreign country. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chairman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> told shareholders that last month's decision to close <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> and streamline the company's Cyber Systems mainframe business was painful but `` essential to the continued successful implementation of the company's strategic focus.'' <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> said the restructuring would result in charges of $ 490 million and layoffs of 3,100 employees, including 800 at <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, which failed to make money in its six-year history. Price said the restructuring should result in a profitable second half and set the stage for sustained growth. Price said he is `` cautiously optimistic'' that <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> can arrange new credit of somewhat over $ 100 million to cover short-term cash needs until later this year, when the company expects to complete the sale of some assets. The company took a step in that direction Wednesday, announcing that it had sold <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Terms of the sale were not disclosed. <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which had revenues of $ 23.3 million in 1988, provides data processing and support products to consumer credit companies and other financial services institutions, including <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. Several shareholders criticized company management for a severance agreement that gave retired executive <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> nearly $ 4 million, although <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> reported profits of only $ 1.7 million in 1988. <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, who still serves on the board of directors and acts as a part-time consultant to the company after serving as one of <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>'s key executives during his 29-year tenure, received scattered boos when introduced to the shareholders at the start of the meeting. He did not address the group.

 <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which has grown in six years to the 10th-largest air carrier in the nation, has no qualms about extending itself to the Northeast. `` We consider this one of the most profitable opportunities in our industry,'' Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> told a news conference Wednesday after announcing a $ 726 million offer for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' Northeast shuttle operation. <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> estimated his airline would need to hire 800 employees to run the shuttle. He said he expected annual revenue of $ 300 million to $ 400 million from the operation. <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 390 million cash for the shuttle, with the balance in cash and debt assumption on 10 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757 aircraft, a press release said. However, <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said the other $ 336 million included 21 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> does not want the 727s but would dispose of them as a credit back to Eastern or in other ways, <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said. The offer had to be made in haste, because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> had scheduled a May 12 hearing on the $ 365 million offer for the shuttle from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said. Eastern filed for Chapter 11 protection March 9, and <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> must approve any sale of assets. If successful in its bid, <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> would operate the shuttle from its headquarters in this <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> suburb. `` This would improve our visibility on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, and it fits right into our specialty, which is high-frequency service in high-density markets,'' <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is the nation's largest airline without any union-represented employees, and <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said the operation would be `` an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> operation, with <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> employees.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees would be interviewed for possible rehiring. Asked if he expected opposition from labor, <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said he did n't think so, because the 800 jobs represent only a fraction of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s workforce. `` I think Eastern employees would be very enthusiastic,'' <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said, `` because, first, the fringe benefits at <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> compare favorably with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s, and, second, the environment at <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is very good.'' In the last year, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> has applied for service to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and has ordered 25 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-300s or 757s for delivery between 1992 and 1995. Despite the $ 800 million order, <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> was far from over-leveraged. The firm's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment banker, <ORGANIZATION> Wertheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schroder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, has assured company officers that the financing could be accomplished, he said. `` This seems like a large chunk. It's not,'' <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said. `` This is a $ 900 million company ... We've always been adequately financed, and we've never had a cash problem. We're well suited to take advantage of these opportunities.'' Started in mid-1983 with 280 employees and three 737s, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> today has about 8,500 employees and 70 planes. It serves 47 cities. It carried 12.7 million passengers last year, turning a $ 9.4 million profit on revenue of $ 775.7 million. In the first quarter of 1989, <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> posted a $ 10.1 million profit.

 Union officials announced plans Wednesday to pursue an employee buyout of strike-plagued Colt Firearms, which was put on the market last week by <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mass.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wesson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Colt competitor, has also expressed interest in buying the division <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Madore </PERSON>, president of Local 376 of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, said the company had hired the Waterbury-based <ORGANIZATION> Naugatuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, which has assisted in other employee buyout attempts, to conduct a feasibility study. The project asked <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment banker hired by <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> to sell the firearms division, to supply financial information about Colt Wednesday morning, <PERSON> Madore </PERSON> said. `` We are firmly commited to pursuing at whatever lengths the feasibility and possibility of making an offer,'' <PERSON> Madore </PERSON> said. `` We do n't see any other manufacturer ... buying Colt Firearms with a commitment to staying in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Madore </PERSON> predicted that any other company that bought <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> would sell off its assets, take control of its patents and close its <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> plants. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday it wanted to sell the troubled firearms division to concentrate on its aerospace, automotive and industrial services operations. Colt has not put a price on the division, but industry analysts have said it probably is worth $ 150 million to $ 200 million. The <ORGANIZATION> UAM </ORGANIZATION> represents about 1,100 workers who walked out three years ago. The firearms division has staffed its <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> plants mostly with non-union replacement workers, although some union members have crossed picket lines and returned to work. About 800 workers remain on strike. About 650 strikers voted unanimously Tuesday night to pursue the buyout, <PERSON> Madore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brecher </PERSON>, deputy commissioner for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, said the department has specialists who can advise employees on how to obtain financing for such buyouts, although he warned the buyouts face enormous difficulties. `` The track record is spotty,'' he said. `` There have n't been that many successful ones in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. The ingredients really require that you have a very patient seller, a seller that for one reason or another is motivated to work with employees.''

<HEAD>Bond Prices Down After S&amp;L Financing Procedure Disclosed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices fell Wednesday after the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced procedures for selling $ 50 billion in new debt to help finance a bailout of the nation's ailing thrifts. Credit-market strategists said the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s plan was structured in such a way that it had the effect of removing some potential demand for other government bonds, which helped depress prices. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year bond fell 9-16 point, or $ 5.63 per $ 1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, climbed to 9.00 percent from 8.95 percent late Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> said it would issue zero-coupon bonds to <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the government-formed borrowing corporation that would raise $ 50 billion under President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to finance liquidation of insolvent thrifts. Zero-coupon bonds are sold at a discount and redeemed after a specific period at a specific face value. Under the thrift legislation, <ORGANIZATION> Refcorp </ORGANIZATION> would sell $ 50 billion of 30-year bonds over three years _ $ 10 billion in the current fiscal year, $ 25 billion in fiscal 1990 and $ 15 billion in fiscal 1991. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, director of money-market research for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said prices fell because under the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> plan, Refcorp wo n't have to buy bonds in the open market to serve as collateral for the zero-coupon bonds it will sell to raise money for the bailouts. The 30-year bond was unchanged to up slightly in light trading until the late-afternoon announcement. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short - and intermediate-term securities were unchanged to down 3-32 point while long-term governments were off \ point to 19-32 point, the <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> financial reporting service said The movement of a point equals a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.75 to 1,132.66. Corporate bond prices were up slightly. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, gained 0.18 to 304.62. The Bond Buyer index was unavailable. Yields on 3-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills rose to 8.84 percent as the discount gained 2 basis points to 8.52 percent. Yields on 6-month bills fell to 8.98 percent as the discount fell 1 basis point to 8.49 percent. Yields on one-year bills were unchanged at 9.14 percent as the discount held at 8.47 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded at 10 -LCB- percent, up from 9 -RCB- percent late Tuesday.

<TEXT>
 Congressional allies of the textile industry, undaunted by setbacks in recent years, formed a task force Wednesday to search for new means to combat foreign inroads in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. `` We know that the textile and apparel workers that we represent need their jobs,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Tenn </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>. `` We will have to find creative legislative solutions to slow the flood of imports that is threatening their jobs.'' <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already has made it clear that he will not back omnibus legislation to aid the textile industry. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has passed such measures in recent years but sponsors have been unable to muster enough votes to override presidential vetoes. Instead of putting all of their efforts into one bill, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said, textile lawmakers would `` pursue many avenues to assist the textile and apparel industry ... Our legislative activities will be much more diverse than they have been in recent years.'' As examples, she cited a bill introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga., that would eliminate a scheduled 50 percent cut in tariffs on textiles and apparels imported from <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> Initiative countries Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, may offer measures involving military apparel, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said in a statement released by her office.

 The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday released its 1989 report on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade barriers, singling out 42 regulations and trade practices that it said impedes imports from the 12 European Economic Community nations. The barriers include quantitative restrictions, export subsidies, customs barriers, public procurement policies, countervailing duties, anti-dumping procedures and tax policies, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> report said. Its release came five days after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration released its report on foreign trade practices it considers unfair. <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehlermann </PERSON> said the timing of the release of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> report was not linked to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> report. He said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> report was an annual event and its release simply `` coincided'' with the report by the Office of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Special Trade Representative. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> report criticized the 1988 U.S. Fair Trade Practices Act which, it said, will `` make it more likely that unilateral action will be taken to redress allegedly unfair trade practices,'' `` Such unilateral action ... without authorization from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is illegal.'' The report also cited the `` Buy American'' provision of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Act that `` has created permanent discrimination in favor of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. products.'' The clause provides for action by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Administration against foreign countries which discriminate against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products or services in government procurement, including a ban against `` offending'' countries. Another category of restrictions includes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> measures which have been found to violate international trading rules, and in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has neither modified nor offered compensation to its trade partners for trade damage caused. As examples the report cites the `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> failure'' to implement findings of the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> on the illegality of the `` Superfund'' oil levy and the `` non-conformity'' of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> system of customs users' fees.

 Two <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> lawmakers, declaring that cable television has turned from a luxury into a `` psychological necessity'' for millions of Americans, vowed Wednesday to press for consumer protections against fast-rising rates. Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., and Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., introduced legislation to place regulations on an industry that they say has been riding roughshod over consumers since it began setting its own rates 2 -LCB- years `` It is time to return consumer protections to cable television,'' <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> said. `` We're not trying to punish the cable TV industry. We're just saying ` Let's be fair'.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> barred state and local governments from setting cable TV rates in most jurisdictions effective Dec. 29, 1986. The move was designed to foster growth in the relatively new industry. Cable companies had complained that their basic rates were kept artificially low by local officials who were subject to election pressures. But with virtually no competition _ more than 99 percent of the nation's cable systems enjoy a local cable monpoly _ basic service prices have risen 32 percent since deregulation, <PERSON> Shays </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates that rates will increase by about 14 percent this year, according to <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shays </PERSON> said the monthly service fee on the basic package in his southern <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> district has increased from $ 4.50 in 1984 to $ 19.95 today. `` It is one thing for the government to foster the growth and development of a fledgling industry ... and quite another to allow a powerful industry to continue extracting monopoly prices from the nation's consumers,'' the senator said. `` You ca n't have it both ways,'' <PERSON> Shays </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` There's either got to be competition or regulation.'' <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> McReynolds </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> argued that cable TV operators do not have monopolies because the $ 13.8 billion industry competes with commercial television as well as video rentals, satellite TV and movie theaters. `` Cable is a competitor in the entertainment marketplace and there's lots of competition,'' she said. <PERSON> McReynolds </PERSON> said basic service fees have increased by about one-third since deregulation because those fees had been set by local officials. Other special services, which were never regulated, have seen only slight increases and in some cases decreases since December 1986, she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> said overall cable fees increased by 6.6 percent in the first year of deregulation and 7.9 percent last year, according to <PERSON> McReynolds </PERSON>. Industry representatives also argue that cable TV is a luxury that consumers can choose to buy, and therefore should not be regulated like power companies. `` We'd like to get to the point that we're a necessity, but we're still a long way from that,'' <PERSON> McReynolds </PERSON> said. The lawmakers, however, argued that cable TV has become more and more of a necessity as cable companies buy up rights to sporting events and other programming that previously was available on traditional commercial television. `` It's become an essential part of our lives,'' said <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> said many Americans, especially the elderly, rely heavily on cable programs for their news, entertainment and even shopping. He called cable `` a psychological necessity.'' The bill would allow local governments to set cable rates, require 60-day notices for service changes and allow regulators to adjust rates as a result of any changes. The measure also seeks to limit concentration of ownership and encourage cable systems to provide local stations. The issue of re-regulating the cable industry emerged in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year during hearings held by Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shays </PERSON> are unsure of their prospects for success in this session. `` Most legislators would like this issue to go away,'' said <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, pointing to the conflict between consumer interests and a well-financed industry. <PERSON> McReynolds </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to hold off on any action until the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> submits a report at the end of 1990 analyzing the impact of cable deregulation. Nearly 55 percent of all TV households in the nation get cable television.

The notification Tuesday came as part of a bidding procedure <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> set up in response to oil billionaire <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' offer, the Journal said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to rescue the S & amp; L industry faces potential challenges from two powerful <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee chairmen after receiving a strong vote of support from the banking panel. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> capped four days of debate by approving the plan on a 49-2 vote Tuesday minutes before midnight. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had passed its own version of the bill last week. The legislation provides $ 157 billion over the next decade, most of it from taxpayers, to close or merge more than 500 failed institutions. It also would put <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulators under more direct administration control, increase spending to uncover fraud at S & amp; Ls and, in the key reform, require S & amp; L owners to risk more of their own capital when they make loans. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is particularly pleased with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill's capital provisions and is calling for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to swiftly complete the legislative process and put a finished bill on the president's desk. `` The risk now is delay,'' said Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, one of the architects of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan. The bill has `` gone through so far without major changes. ... If someone wanted to tinker with major components, we would argue that would be unwarranted and very costly.'' In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> indicated the administration would be working to modify some provisions of the bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> before the measure clears <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> singled out changes in the administration's proposals for setting up the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a new federal agency to dispose of repossessed assets of insolvent S & amp; Ls, including a provision which would require that some of the property be sold to low-income people at a discount. `` We do have serious concerns about the nature and direction of amendments which reconfigure the <ORGANIZATION> Resoution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The committee has made substantial modifications which alter the original design and intent of the administration proposal,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. `` We are particularly concerned about provisions that would divert resources needed for savings and loan resolutions to housing subsidies.'' Staff aides to the banking committee are expected to take until the end of next week to put the panel's bill in proper form and write a report accompanying the legislation. Other committees with an interest in parts of the measure would then get a week to produce alternatives, leaving a slim chance that the full House would before Memorial Day. Administration officials are also happy that both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, so far, have stuck with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s complicated mechanism for keeping $ 50 billion in <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L spending out of the budget deficit. However, both Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, and Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, disagree with major provisions of the <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, in a speech last month, said he believes the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> financing mechanism wastes about $ 150 million a year because it inflates the government's borrowing costs. He's being urged by Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a member of the banking committee, to pursue the issue by including the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L spending in the budget deficit, but exempting it from the automatic cuts under Gramm-Rudman. `` If nothing else, <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> can push it and back off and collect a few chits from the administration,'' said an industry lobbyist who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` He's got absolutely nothing to lose. It makes him a player on a very important issue.'' Pepper, whose panel governs debate on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, is pushing for looser capital rules, arguing that it is unfair to take away accounting breaks given to S & amp; Ls in the early 1980s in exchange for their takeover of ailing institutions. The legislation requires S & amp; L owners to risk $ 3 of `` real money'' or `` tangible'' capital for every $ 100 they lend _ double the requirement of the bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last month. The capital would act as a buffer to absorb losses before government deposit insurance kicks in. Pepper is likely to insist that the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> get a chance to reconsider the capital provisions.

<HEAD>Cuomo Signs Poison Pill Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Corporate directors will be able to use a `` poison pill'' to ward off unwanted takeover bids in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> under a bill signed into law Wednesday by Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. Companies in other states can enact a poison pill, or anti-takeover plan, on their own. But legislation was needed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> because of a court decision last year that barred companies from treating the shares of a would-be acquirer different from those of other shareholders. The state had given that power to directors, but it expired April 1. The new law gives boards of directors facing a hostile takeover a chance to buy time to evaluate and react to the offers. By using a poison pill, those directors could make it more expensive for an outsider to buy a controlling portion of stock. At the same time, most poison pills allow stockholders of the company to buy more shares at a cheaper price. The new law takes effect immediately and expires July 1. Between now and then, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> are expected to work on some sort of permanent poison pill measure. Poison pills generally have been supported by management and Fortune 500 companies while they largely have been opposed by the securities industry and takeover entrepreneurs. `` Passage of this bill removes an incentive for people to leave <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the state's largest business lobbying group. The bill was approved unanimously in the Democratic-controlled state Assembly earlier Wednesday.

 An <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> waste-disposal company shipped a barge containing toxic levels of lead and cadmium overseas without required government approval, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has proposed a $ 51,750 fine. <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metallurgical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Granite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which failed to get <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s permission to export the material, is the first company hit with a fine under 1986 hazardous-waste export laws, the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> EPA is committed to ensuring that this country's hazardous waste problems are not simply relocated to other countries,'' said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Regional Administrator <PERSON> Valdus </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamkus </PERSON>, who also proposed a $ 12,700 fine against <ORGANIZATION> Beelman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Truck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Libory </LOCATION>, which is accused of accepting the shipment without proper documentation The Triangle shipment to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> was one of thousands last year by businesses seeking to avoid the expense of complying with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hazardous-waste laws, the <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> reported. But for Triangle, the matter did not end when the ship containing its wastes docked this year in <LOCATION> Bilbao </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law, toxic-waste exporters must notify the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and, working through the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, gain approval from the importing nation before shipment. In Triangle's case, the company notified the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> but the ship set sail before Spanish approval was granted, the <PERSON> Post-Dispatch </PERSON> said. Triangle President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wegryzn </PERSON> acknowledged the materials were not shipped with <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s approval, but said he believed notifying the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> was sufficient. The materials were not highly toxic chemical wastes, said officials of the company, which takes metal wastes from steel mills, foundries and smelters and then resells them. On Dec. 28, about 750 cubic yards of metal waste and contaminated dirt from a 1984 Triangle warehouse fire was trucked to a barge on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and sent to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. The ship containing the waste arrived in <LOCATION> Bilbao </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, on Feb. 11 and the waste was trucked to Er Cosa, a company that reclaims copper. Er <PERSON> Cosa </PERSON> official <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Boveda </PERSON> said government approval was not required in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to receive the shipment he characterized as routine. The law requiring approval of the receiving nation went into effect in November 1986 _ the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> step to address concerns about toxic exports. Heavy fines and even jail sentences can be imposed for willful violations.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade minister told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials Tuesday his government plans to open trans-Pacific hotlines to help <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> enterprises boost exports to his country, a Japanese official reported. <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsuzuka </PERSON>, minister of international trade and industry, informed <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> of the project, said <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Shingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamagami </PERSON>. Under the plan, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters or potential exporters would be invited to call in questions, problems or complaints directly to the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> MITI ministry, overseer of the country's global trade, using circuits available at Japanese government commercial offices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and three other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities, he said. Complaints of Japanese import barriers and other red tape are a major source of trade friction between the two countries, aggravated by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last year of $ 52 billion, which after a modest drop is again rising. Details such as whether the hotlines would be for voice conversation or data exchange were not yet available, the spokesman said. There was no immediate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reaction. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and other countries enjoying large trade surpluses with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are lobbying vigorously to avoid being targeted by the end of this month for potential retaliation under 1988 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade legislation.

The capital would act as a buffer to absorb losses before government deposit insurance kicks in. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and one of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal's architects, praised the bill, saying, `` This committee exceeded everyone's expectations. ... Despite all the criticism of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan, the plain fact is it's gone through pretty much intact.'' `` This is a good bill. ... We all have reason to be proud,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the committee's chairman. `` We will move this bill on the fast track as fast as House rules allow.'' After the banking panel completes its report on the bill, probably by the end of next week, at least two other committees _ Ways and <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> _ will have one week to review sections within their jurisdiction. Then, depending on how long the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> devotes to debate and action, a joint House-Senate conference committee could resolve differences between the two chambers and put the bill on the president's desk by the July 4 recess, five months after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his proposal. The administration has endorsed the capital provisions of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill, but Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is objecting, arguing it is unfair to take away capital breaks given to S & amp; Ls in the early 1980s in exchange for their takeover of ailing institutions Pepper's committee sets the rules governing debate on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor and committee members and their aides said they expect he will insist the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> get the chance to amend the capital standards. Most of the cost of the bailout will be born by taxpayers, the rest by the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry. However, $ 50 billion of the spending in the next three years will be excluded from the budget deficit through a complicated plan for borrowing the money, helping <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> meet his `` no new taxes pledge.'' Two provisions in the House legislation, not adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, are aimed at helping poor people obtain housing. One, offered by Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., and adopted 33-18, requires the new government agency that will liquidate failed S & amp; Ls _ the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ to offer poor people and non-profit groups at least a three-month option to buy low-priced residential properties owned by failed S & amp; Ls Two Republicans joined the 31 Democrats on the panel in passing the amendment. The 18 Republicans opposing it argued that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s proposal would dangerously restrict the government's ability to sell property from failed S & amp; Ls, open the government to lawsuits and eventually add to the taxpayer cost of the bailout <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, however, said his plan affected only $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion of the $ 200 billion to $ 300 billion in real estate the government will inherit from sick institutions and argued that it was a modest way to channel a few of the benefits of the massive S & amp; L bill to the public. A provision offered by <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and adopted last week requires the S & amp; L industry, through the regional <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION>, to provide $ 75 million a year to pay for reduced-rate mortgages for poor people. However, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel on Tuesday defeated a pair of amendments aimed at encouraging banks to do a better job of serving poor people and minorities. On a 27-23 vote with seven Democrats joining all 20 Republicans, the panel rejected an amendment by <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> that would have forced banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to publicly disclose federal regulators' ratings on how well they serve poor and minorities neighborhoods By a 30-21 vote, with 10 Democrats joining 20 Republicans, it voted against an amendment requiring regulators to report information on mortgage lending by race, age and gender. `` If you think for a second that discrimination does n't exist in financial institutions, then we are living in <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, because it happens every day,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. Opponents said public disclosure of ratings kept by banking regulators would be misinterpreted by depositors and used by civil rights and community groups to create mischief. In other action Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee: _ Expanded the board overseeing the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> from three members to five members, including Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and a private real estate expert <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had wanted a three-member board headed by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and including Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>. The committee also added <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> as a non-voting member He likely will be in charge of the day-to-day task of administering the cleanup. _ Voted 33-16 to adopt an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>., to require banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls with assets of more than $ 150 million to obtain independent audits of their financial _ Defeated, 26-23, an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, that would have permitted regulators to revoke special accounting breaks granted to acquirors of failed S & amp; Ls in 1988
