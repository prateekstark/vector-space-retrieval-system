<HEAD>Spider Mites Threaten Drought-Stressed Soybean Crops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drought-weary farmers who are pinning their hopes on soybeans now face another threat: tiny, hungry mites that like dry weather and can go unnoticed while destroying crops. State agriculture officials say spider mites are invading soybean fields in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and other drought-plagued <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> states. `` It's a difficult critter to fight because they're hard to see with the naked eye,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Landis </PERSON>, a field crops entomologist at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` When a crop looks bad, it's blamed on other things _ mostly the drought. It's not until the problem becomes severe that the mites are discovered,'' <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> said Monday. The mites, which thrive in dry, hot conditions, feed on the underside of plant leaves by piercing plant cells and extracting the sap, <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> said. After a few days, the leaves bear yellow speckles and eventually turn brown or bronze. `` Entire fields can be completely lost if spider mites are not controlled and weather conditions allow them to build up populations,'' <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> said. The eight-legged pests are easily carried on the wind from field to field. `` It's just another thing you've got to fight,'' said farmer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION>, who recently discovered mites in his soybean field. The infestation is potentially another serious blow to farmers who have lost much of their corn crop in the drought and were hoping to cut their losses with soybeans, which are bringing in higher prices. Because farmers in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> also are combating the mites, there has been a shortage of pesticides to kill the pests, <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> said. `` We are running at capacity in an attempt to meet the stepped-up demand,'' <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrick </PERSON> said of the production of one such pesticide, <ORGANIZATION> Lorsban </ORGANIZATION> 4 E. `` The demand has been so great for the product we're just running out of product.''

 Tropical storm <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> was downgraded to a tropical depression Tuesday after moving inland and weakening, leaving one person missing in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> but raising hopes that its remnants could bring rain to drought-stricken <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> farmers. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> rescued six people who endured two days of wind and rain on an island after high seas prevented them from returning to the mainland. There was virtually no damage in southern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> except for some spot flooding and tree limbs blown down. Scattered damage was reported in southern <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, including downed tree limbs and scattered power outages. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, where preparations continued for next week's Republican National Convention, few problems developed from the storm `` The beneficial aspects of this tropical storm are probably much greater than any negative effects from this system _ and that's rain,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. Shortly before 5 p.m. CDT, forecasters downgraded the storm to a tropical depression as its highest sustained wind speed dropped to 35 mph; a storm is designated a tropical storm when wind speed hits 39 mph. The storm's center was just west-southwest of <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> by 9:30 p.m., and was expected to continue moving slowly northwest, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Seas of 7 to 10 feet were expected to drop behind the storm, forecasters said. Although the storm was not producing widespread rain, there was a danger of flooding from locally heavy storms, the weather service said. Flooding was reported in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> in low areas and along overflowing rivers and streams. About 150 people in <LOCATION> Harrison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> were forced to move to higher ground Tuesday because of river flooding, said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON>, deputy director for <ORGANIZATION> Harrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have people on all of the rivers'' monitoring the levels. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> storm season's second named tropical storm, still had the potential of moving back over the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, where it would gain strength from the warm water, but forecasters said that was unlikely. `` We think it's going to go on a more west track, west northwest, then turn toward the northwest up over the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> area,'' Sheets said. `` We do n't think it's going to go back out over the water so there's not much chance of it ever strengthening again.'' Thousands of workers from the marshes and offshore oil rigs were evacuated Monday as a precaution, and tourists abandoned the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> coasts. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> suspended a search Tuesday for a 15-year-old boy who fell overboard when a 24-foot fishing boat capsized near <LOCATION> Dauphin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> off the coast of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. The youth, whose name was not given, was reported missing Tuesday by a survivor found clinging to the hull of a vessel that capsized Monday in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Sound. Searchers believe the boat was swamped by seven-foot waves. Although <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> barely bruised <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s coastline, 11.6 inches of rain was reported at <LOCATION> Dauphin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> for the 24-hour period ending at 7 a.m. Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> rescued six people who went camping Sunday on <LOCATION> Petit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bois </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Pasagoula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, when the forecast was for mostly sunny weather. That night, the weather turned bad and the water became too choppy to travel back to the mainland. `` We lost one of the tents,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. `` We patched the other with garbage bags and anything else we could find. We exhausted everything we had.'' `` We have n't slept since Sunday,'' she said after being rescued Tuesday. `` We have n't been dry since then.'' Homes were evacuated east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> fishing villages of <LOCATION> Hopedale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yscloskey </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Lafourche </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>, authorities readied eight evacuation centers Monday, but seven of the centers remained closed Tuesday, the eighth was unoccupied and parish officials said they expected few problems with the storm.

<HEAD>Countdown Set to Begin Tonight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A new countdown begins tonight for a 22-second firing of space shuttle Discovery's three main engines, a vital test that has been postponed five times because of malfunctions. If this test succeeds, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials will set a date for the first American manned space flight since the Challenger burst into flames on liftoff in January 1986. The Discovery launch date, already officially moved four times, is not likely to be before October because of all the test delays. The flight readiness firing, as it's called, is an overall workout of the main engines, computer software, ground support equipment, communications lines and the launch teams. The `` call to stations'' that begins the countdown was scheduled for 6:10 p.m. with the test set for 7:30 a.m. Wednesday. Without further problems, fueling of the shuttle's huge tank begins a half hour before midnight. The shuttle's No. 2 engine is fitted with a new `` hydrogen bleed valve'' and sensor to replace units that caused a scheduled test to be scrapped last Thursday in the split second before the start of ignition. `` The recovery from the problem on Thursday shows that the team is working smoothly and I am expecting an on-time engine firing on Wednesday morning,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Kennedy Space Center Discovery's three engines will be fired with slightly different start and stop times, using only a portion of the half million gallons of fuel in the external tank. Bolts 3 feet long and 3 inches in diameter hold the shuttle to the pad while the engines generate 1.1 million pounds of thrust. The two solid fuel rocket boosters flanking the shuttle tank will not be ignited but will be subjected to the same bending movements that led to a leak in one of the joints during Challenger's liftoff. That leak allowed flame to escape and led to the shuttle's destruction and the deaths of seven astronauts. Flight readiness firings have been required in the past for new shuttles only, except for one time when a malfunction made a retest necessary. But the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is treating Discovery as an untried ship because of the long time since the last flight and the many changes since the Challenger disaster. Last Thursday's engine test was aborted in the last second when a sensor reported that a valve had not closed as it was supposed to. Engineers determined that the sensor, not the valve, was malfunctioning but decided to replace both parts. The designer of the shuttle rocket booster, meanwhile, announced Monday that the last of five full-scale test-firings for the booster will be held Aug. 18. The fifth in the series of firings of the 126-foot-long redesigned rocket will be conducted at <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> plant

<HEAD>Congress Works To Save Last Free Stretch of Columbia River</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> rolls lazily through the desert of central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, nourishing crops and wildlife in what otherwise would be a wasteland of sagebrush and barren hills. The river, which once roared through deep gorges, was immortalized in <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s Depression-era song `` Roll On, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'' _ `` <PERSON> Green </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> fir where the waters cut through, Down her wild mountains and canyons she flew, Canadian North-west to the ocean so blue, It's roll on, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, roll on!'' But after the construction of more than a dozen dams in 51 years, the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> has rolled nearly to a standstill. For much of its 1,214 miles, the river is a series of dams and slackwater reservoirs, providing electricity, irrigation and flood control for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> claims one last free-flowing stretch _ the 55-mile Hanford Reach _ and it too is facing major development. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> is proposing a $ 180 million project to open the river to barge traffic all the way to <LOCATION> Wenatchee </LOCATION>, so that logs, wheat and apples from the state's interior can be floated to <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> ports. The plan calls for dredging part of the river and building giant lifts over three dams to allow navigation between <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wenatchee </LOCATION>. Opponents say the dredging would forever ruin valuable fish and wildlife habitat, archaeological sites and the last vestige of natural river flow. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation has introduced legislation to protect the area. The reach `` is one of the only areas where spawning habitats remain undisturbed, nesting areas abound, and majestic cliffs lining the river are mirrored in its quiet, deep calm,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash. `` We're telling them do n't go ahead with these ill-conceived plans until we know the impact on spawning and recreation, the most important use of the river,'' said Republican Rep. <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, whose district includes the area Under the bill, the Department of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> would protect the Hanford Reach for eight years until a study determines whether to permanently preserve the stretch under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The bill has already cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> but <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> has delayed House action while negotiations continue to address concerns of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>. That agency operates the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation, a sprawling plutonium-production site that straddles the river. The Energy Department is worried the study could hamper Hanford operations, said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Seeley </PERSON>, a legislative aide to <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>. There lies the irony of the `` wild and scenic'' designation: as the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> flows past nine federal nuclear reactors no one would call the view pastoral. The huge, eerie reactors, technological marvels in their time, produced much of the plutonium for the nation's nuclear weapons arsenal. The slow-moving river creeps past the hulking reactors, with pumping stations, razor-wire fences and guard towers casting shadows over the water. Eight are closed permanently. The newest, the N Reactor, which was placed on `` cold standby'' earlier this year because the federal government no longer needed the plutonium, stands closest to the river, a brooding presence amid the jumping fish, herons and deer. Much of the shore is off-limits to recreational users because the federal government wanted a buffer zone around its reactors. The Hanford Reach runs from Priest Rapids Dam, south of <LOCATION> Mattawa </LOCATION>, to the reservoir of <PERSON> McNary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dam </PERSON> just north of <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>. The biggest objections to the dredging are that the movement of a half-million cubic yards of dirt would destroy some of the last wild runs of chinook salmon, which battle their way up river to spawn. `` That's one of the few or perhaps the only remaining natural spawning area in that entire river system below Grand Coulee -LRB- dam -RRB- that salmon and steelhead can get too,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, deputy director the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> has proposed building an artificial salmon spawning channel, to compensate for areas lost to dredging. But opponents say that would not work. `` Artificial spawning channels just do n't provide the quantity and quality of reproduction that the natural free-flowing river provides,'' <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said. `` The technology has n't been that well-perfected.'' The dredging proposal has also run into stiff fiscal opposition. The cost-benefit ratio for the project currently stands at just 80 cents in benefits for every dollar spent, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sellar </PERSON>, manager of water resources for the Port of <LOCATION> Chelan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Wenatchee </LOCATION>, which has been pushing the plan since the 1950s. The port and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> are now studying the plan to try to make it economically stronger. For instance, some people feel that large quantities of apples could not be moved by barge because of the length of the trip, but others say using refrigerated containers would keep them fresh, <PERSON> Sellar </PERSON> said. The port hopes to save up to 40 percent in transportation costs compared to rail or trucking. `` One barge will move the equivalent of 50 to 60 trucks,'' <PERSON> Sellar </PERSON> said.

 A distaste for turning lambs into chops has transformed a sewage treatment plant into a haven for sheep, chickens, geese, rabbits and, as their keeper puts it, `` whatever people throw over the fence.'' The creatures live on the 107-acre spread of the <ORGANIZATION> Upper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abatement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> amid tanks, pipes, pools, pumps, an incinerator and plenty of grass for grazing. <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, plant director, recalls that in the spring of 1978 a farmer was allowed to leave two lambs there to fatten up on the plant's grassy field. By the time the farmer returned in the fall, plant employees had grown attached to the lambs and pleaded that they be spared their fate as shish kebab. So, the sewage district board voted to buy the sheep from the farmer. Soon, more creatures arrived unannounced, apparently abandoned by their owners. `` We'd come in the morning and one day we had 12 geese,'' <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said Monday. `` The next day we had 12 ducks, then four chickens.'' On Monday, the `` community,'' as <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> describes it, included three sheep, two dozen geese, two dozen chickens and roosters _ `` we get a lot of roosters'' _ and uncounted rabbits and pigeons. The animals drink from a fountain that carries clean water. They also have the run of two huts, and staff at the sewage plant feed them grain. Motorists stop every day to look, <ORGANIZATION> Holland </ORGANIZATION> said, and some leave with a pet. `` We give them away to anybody who asks,'' <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said, `` as long as they're not going to eat them.''

 For eight years, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> sent their youth to slaughter, squandered their wealth and mortaged their futures in a war that gained nothing for either side. Children as young as 13, eagerly seeking a martyr's death, perished as sacrificial mine sweepers. Children, parents and grandparents were blown to bits or crippled by bombs, shells and missiles in the cities of both sides. Soldiers and civilians were maimed by poison warfare. In all, more than 1 million people were killed or wounded. The war cost hundreds of billions of dollars and caused measureless agony and grief. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, announced Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that the two enemies had agreed to end the war with a cease-fire Aug. 20 and to begin peace negotiations Aug. 25 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. On the killing fields near the southern port of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers dug trenches and unreeled barbed wire for set-piece battles reminiscent of World War I. Men and boys died by the thousands in the mud and shallow water of the marshes. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s official news media periodically reported a `` harvest of the rotten heads.'' Foreign correspondents taken on guided tours were shown heaps of Iranian bodies on the battlefield. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> spoke of victories by its `` martyrdom-seeking'' soldiers and Revolutionary Guards. The ranks were swollen by children wearing `` Martyr'' T-shirts, pressed into the service of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s fundamentalist Islamic government. Sometimes it seemed the young men of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> commuted to battle, so close was the front to many cities. They returned in coffins atop automobiles moving in long processions. Iranians buried their dead in the Martyrs' Cemetery outside <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, a huge graveyard whose centerpiece is a `` fountain of blood'' spewing water dyed red. By Western estimates, the set-piece battles east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> in January 1987 killed 25,000 Iranians and 10,000 Iraqis. All the casualty figures are estimates. Neither country provided comprehensive numbers during the war, which began in September 1980 with border skirmishes followed by an Iraqi invasion across the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON>, the waterway that forms the southern border. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordesman </PERSON> says in his book `` The Iran-Iraq War and Western Security,'' that at least 300,000 Iranians were killed and 600,000 wounded through 1987, with corresponding for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of 120,000 and 300,000. He says the estimates are conservative, that by some accounts the dead total 1 million and the wounded 1.7 million. By comparison, 2.9 million people were killed in the Korean war and 2.4 million in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Hundreds of billions of dollars were devoured by arms purchases, lost revenues, damaged or destroyed buildings and industrial plants. War damage extended beyond <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> insurance exchange, reported 90 ships sunk or destroyed in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and 546 attacked, with at least 300 sailors killed and 300 injured. Ninety-three ships were trapped in Iraqi waterways throughout the war, many of them written off. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> said its underwriters paid more than $ 1 billion in ship claims and other insurers a like amount. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> started the war with foreign exchange reserves of $ 35 billion and now owes an estimated $ 60 billion. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has not borrowed but its foreign exchange reserves have declined to a few billion dollars. <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, an financial journal published in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, estimates <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> needs $ 80 billion and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> $ 30 billion to rebuild transportation, oil installations, housing, factories, schools and hospitals. Evidence of the human cost is everywhere. `` Every family has been touched by the war,'' an accountant named <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> told an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> earlier this month. `` They've all had a son or a brother killed or maimed or taken prisoner,'' he said. `` Every family has one or more men in the army.'' Two of <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>'s sons were in the army and a third was at home, minus a hand and a leg. Battle casualties include many children under 15 who ran into mine fields with plastic `` keys to Paradise'' around their necks. French photographer <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Lochon </PERSON> visited the front in 1984 and reported seeing the bodies of many dead children `` who were no older than 12 or 14.'' `` The skull shaved, wrapped in the red scarf of the martyrs, the key to Paradise around the neck, they were scattered around the rocky trenches or floating in the still waters,'' he said. Many other warriors shown on Iranian television appeared elderly, with white hair and grins that showed few teeth. In <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> encouraged older citizens to join the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militia. Thousands of civilians were killed by bombs and surface-to-surface missiles that struck hospitals, schools and residential areas in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and other cities. Hundreds of missiles were fired in a round of the `` war of the cities'' earlier this year. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reported 1,145 civilians killed and 4,000 wounded. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> did not give casualty figures, but nearly 30 children were killed when an Iranian missile hit a <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> school last year. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> battlefield casualties have been only about one-quarter of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s, but <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has only 16 million people compared to 45 million in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and was conscious from the beginning of the need to avoid heavy losses. It resorted to chemical weapons, which are banned by the 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Convention. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> reports say one of those weapons was mustard gas, the scourge of the World War I trenches. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed 5,000 Kurds were killed and 5,000 wounded in a chemical attack on the border town of <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> in March. Foreign reporters taken there saw many bodies, unmarked by wounds. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Azizi </PERSON>, a 25-year-old student, was in <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> at the time and said streets were strewn with the bodies of victims. Doctors said they suspected mustard gas killed them. `` Any door you opened, there were children, men and women, dying, dead,'' <ORGANIZATION> Azizi </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The Iran-Iraq war cost hundreds of billions of dollars in lost revenues, damaged and destroyed buildings, industrial plants, ships and military equipment. Aside from the human toll, the economic cost to the combatants, according to Israeli experts who followed the war closely, was more than $ 200 billion through 1986. Nineteen months of further devastation added to this figure. Other countries have lost as well. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> insurance firm, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, reports that in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> `` tanker war'' 90 ships were sunk or destroyed and and 546 ships attacked, most of them damaged. Another 93 ships have been trapped in Iraqi waterways since the war began, many of them written off. Insurance losses paid out by <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> on ship hulls has been more than $ 1 billion. Other firms paid a similar amount, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyds </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> started the war with foreign exchange reserves of $ 35 billion and now owes foreign countries an estimated $ 60 billion. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has avoided borrowing but has run down its foreign exchange reserves to a few billion dollars. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> refused to give figures on losses, human, material or economic. The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> economic paper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, quoting Western economic experts, says <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> needs $ 80 billion to rebuild transport facilities, oil installations, housing, factories, schools and hospitals. It said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> needs $ 30 billion for the same task. A report by <PERSON> Kiyotaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsuji </PERSON> of the Japanese institute of <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> estimated that damage to oil installations alone, from bombing and shelling raids, amounted to $ 28 billion for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and $ 8 billion for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Estimates of military equipment purchases for the war, above normal pre-war expenditures vary, from $ 25 billion to $ 40 billion for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and from $ 35 billion to $ 70 billion for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Paying, feeding and treating wounded soldiers added billions more to war expenditures. Losses in oil revenues, estimated by <PERSON> Tsuji </PERSON>, are $ 23 billion for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and $ 65 billion for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Pre-war production in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was 3.6 million barrels a day. It fell to 1.2 million barrels a day in 1981 and gradually has been built back to 2.7 million barrels a day. Iraqi bombing raids decimated <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s refining capacity from 1.3 million barrels a day pre-war, to 400,000 barrels a day, forcing the Iranians to import petroleum products costing $ 1.5 million a year, oil experts here estimated. Iraqi raids damaged or put out of action Iranian refineries at <LOCATION> Abadan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION>, Shiraz, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION>. The billion-dollar oil loading facility at <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> island is virtually destroyed. Iranians wrecked <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s oil shipping terminal at <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION>. Construction in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has stopped because of Iraqi bombing at a major petrochemical plant being built with Japanese help at <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, at the huge gas collection and treatment plant being built by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Nar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kangan </LOCATION>, and at a nuclear power plant at <LOCATION> Bushehr </LOCATION>. Early in the war <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> lost its 140,000 barrel-a-day oil refinery at <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> port was closed and two-thirds of the 1 million inhabitants of the city fled shelling attacks from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> which damaged most of the buildings.

 In the two years since she married the queen's second son <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Duchess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> has brought both sparkle and new controversy to the royal scene Some critics find her vivacious personality and sense of fun tiresome or vulgar, her adventurous spirit verging on the reckless. But royal watchers say the 28-year-old former <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> is a favorite with Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. Prince <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, a tall, handsome <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant, gained a playboy reputation during a colorful bachelorhood. It included a well-publicized romance with an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> actress, <PERSON> Koo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, who once appeared in soft-porn movies. But by the spring of 1986 <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> was clearly smitten with the red-haired Miss <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>. The public were enjoying her lively good nature and the queen was reported to be greatly relieved that <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> had found a suitable wife. They married at Westminster Abbey July 23, 1986, and became the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> and Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Both were 26. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> was a new kind of royal bride. A sales executive with a graphic arts publishing company when she married, she had led a free and independent life that included a three-year romance with motor-racing figure <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON> <PERSON> McNally </PERSON>, a widower with two sons. Robust, athletic and outspoken, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> was far from the slim, demure and impeccably-groomed English rose that Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, wife of Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, typified. She kept working after her marriage, and although she had given up her publishing job by early 1988, she planned to do free-lance work. While <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> pursued his career as a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot, his wife learned to fly a helicopter and a plane so she could share the experience with him. The <ORGANIZATION> Yorks </ORGANIZATION> have rejected the traditional choice of an old stately home and are building a new house near <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> _ in a neo-Tudor style that has drawn some criticism. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>'s attempts to find a fashion sense of her own led to some howling failures, each of which was dissected in the press. The media also criticized what they saw as the duchess' brash and vulgar behavior during the couple's March <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour, particularly in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Newspapers were especially critical of the duchess' quip: `` I'll see you later,'' to a man who yelled out, `` I love you'' at a dinner When <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> wore a flamboyant black-and-red gown to a black-tie dinner, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> wrote: `` While the stars of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> dressed in discreet black and stayed in the shadows, down the stairs walloped someone who looked as if she'd just won third prize for her <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> impersonation ... at some forgotten resort.'' `` Has the Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> gone too far?'' asked the Observer newspaper. As <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> grew heavily pregnant, the tabloids carried unflattering photos of her and made remarks about her weight. But the duchess's sense of humor scarcely flagged _ except in May when a newspaper carried a photo of her father, Maj. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, emerging from a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> massage parlor. While some newspapers called him <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> and suggested he be fired from his job as polo manager to <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, the heir to the throne, and others said the duchess was advised to avoid him in public, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> was photographed speaking to her father, worriedly. The major had become a close friend of the queen's husband, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, through their shared interest in polo. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, born Oct. 15, 1959, has known all the queen's children since childhood. She became a close friend of <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, who is reported to have done some matchmaking in <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>'s relationship with <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> grew up at her family's 18th-century farmhouse set in 1,200 acres of rolling <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> countryside at <PERSON> Dummer </PERSON>. She was educated at two local boarding schools, <PERSON> Daneshill </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Hurst </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lodge </LOCATION>, where she was head girl _ the school leader _ excelling at sports rather than studies. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>'s parents divorced when she was 14, and her mother, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>, married Argentine polo professional <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrantes </PERSON>. They live at Trenque Laughen near <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> and travel the international polo circuit. After school, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> studied at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION>' secretarial college in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Then it was off to work, first at an apartment rental agency, then at a Covent Garden art gallery, a sports public relations agency and finally as a sales executive with B.C.K. Graphic Arts in fashionable <PERSON> Mayfair </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Nervous Over Business Week Scandal, Competitors Watch Their Backs</HEAD>

 Insider trading on stolen Business Week stock tip columns has alarmed the magazine's rivals, compelling some to review their own security and recheck back issues to make sure they have n't been victimized, too. `` We do n't take any pleasure in what happened to Business Week, but we're in the enviable position of bolting the barn door before the horse escapes, or at least checking the locks,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Belis </PERSON>, spokesman for Fortune, which has a biweekly circulation of 755,000. `` We're checking the locks.'' <PERSON> Belis </PERSON> said a spot check of Fortune's `` Companies to Watch'' column going back several months showed no unusual prepublication activity in any stocks mentioned. Senior editorial officials at Forbes and Money, two other widely read business magazines, also said they were reassessing protection of market-sensitive material in the aftermath of the scandal at Business Week. In addition, the printing companies used by all four magazines said they were scrutinizing security and reminding all employees that unpublished material is sacrosanct and not to leave the plant. The scandal surfaced July 21 when Business Week, the nation's largest business weekly with a circulation of nearly 1 million, disclosed evidence of possibly illegal trading on stocks featured in its `` Inside Wall Street'' column before it was available to the public A major investigation has since revealed workers in two plants run by Business Week printer R.R. <ORGANIZATION> Donnelley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> took copies the day before they were released to the public and peddled them to brokers, sometimes for as little as $ 20 each. As of the weekend, four <PERSON> Donnelley </PERSON> printers and three stock brokers, one each from <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Advest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, had lost their jobs. Trades in several more brokerages are under investigation for possible links to prepublished `` Inside Wall Street'' tips. Unlike newspapers, where the time gap between writing and printing sensitive material is brief, weeklies and monthlies face the problem of protecting potentially market-moving items over a period of days and weeks. The problem is compounded in mass-circulation magazines, which rely on printing plants at several locations and the honesty of hundreds of printers, couriers, truckers and postal workers who have access before subscribers do. `` There's a real limitation on our ability to place guards on every truck,'' said <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, managing editor of Money, a monthly with a circulation of 1.8 million. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said Money sent a letter to its printer, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Color </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Effingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, after the Business Week scandal surfaced, warning that `` the material they handle is property of Money magazine. It is their obligation to protect Money's property as it passes through their hands.'' He said a check of Money's `` Wall Street'' column and other potentially sensitive material going back at least one year found no suspicious trading. At <LOCATION> Forbes </LOCATION>, also printed by <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Color </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, deputy managing editor <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Minard </PERSON> said the 740,000-circulation weekly and its printer historically have had a firm understanding about confidentiality. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Minard </PERSON> said, `` we did reiterate to World Color that we expect the agreement we've had with them to be vigilantly observed.'' <PERSON> Minard </PERSON> said there was no effort at Forbes to recheck back issues, but he said, `` I suppose on a continuing basis, I very unofficially monitor it.'' For their part, <PERSON> Donnelley </PERSON>, World Color and <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Printing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Wauseca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, which prints Fortune, have undertaken security crackdowns. Besides dismissing employees implicated in the Business Week scandal, Chicago-based <PERSON> Donnelley </PERSON> has reminded all workers of a ban on removing any material from plants. Others have done likewise. <PERSON> Donnelley </PERSON> also has uniformed sentries at exits, plainclothes guards patrolling production lines and a policy that workers' clothing may be searched Nevertheless, spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratcliffe </PERSON> said, the company still must largely rely on employee's integrity. `` To frisk 650 people would be a bit impractical,'' he said.

Task</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For the past 13 years, three national armies and two guerrilla insurgencies have been fighting in southwestern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Now, finally, there is hope that an end to the conflict may be within reach. The latest step in the process occurred Monday when South African Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said a `` de facto cessation of hostilities'' is now in effect in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, the scene of direct or indirect military involvement by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The imponderables in the region are many and just keeping track of all the players is no small achievement. The Cubans have been in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> since that country's independence from <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> rule in 1975. South Africans have fought intermittently in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, worried about Marxist penetration in an area close to home. The <ORGANIZATION> Angolan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, of course, has been a major player, arrayed against both the South Africans and a U.S.-backed rebel group. Finally, in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, a black nationalist liberation movement has been fighting South African colonial control. The trick for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats, led by Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, is to devise a formula that would induce each of the five to lay down its arms. For years, progress was negligible but things began to change when <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, serving as peace mediator, succeeded in convening a meeting of South African, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> and Angolan authorities in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> last May. At that meeting and in three subsequent sessions, the outlines of a settlement have come into view. Following is a brief summary of the interests of each party: <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ It has said for years that it would be willing to allow independence and black majority rule in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> so long as the estimated 50,000 Cubans leave <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in a reasonable time. Continued colonial control of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> has been expensive for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the departure of the Cubans would ease its security concerns about <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> _ Its initial reason for becoming involved in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> was to protect a Marxist ally against South African military encroachment. If the South Africans promise to leave, that would remove the excuse for which the Cubans were sent to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in the first place. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> could withdraw its troops with its head held high, claiming that <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> was now safe from South African aggression. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> _ It has been devastated by years of warfare. A Cuban withdrawal could make the government more vulnerable to attacks by the anti-communist guerrilla movement. On the other hand, the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels under the package deal now being negotiated would no longer receive assistance from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, whose forces would be withdrawn to within the country's national boundaries. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> _ Known formally as the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> is the Namibian rebel group that has been fighting South African colonial rule for more than 20 years Once South Africa consents to elections for an independent government, <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> can finally lay down its arms and reintegrate into Namibian society. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ It has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in support of its ally over the years. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has been showing increasing eagerness in promoting a settlement, apparently intent on cutting costs in an area of minimal strategic concern. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ Its main interest is eliminating the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> military presence in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s inclination to send large expeditionary forces to distant lands has long been a sore point in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. For the past three years, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been sending military aid to the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>'s fate is not under discussion in the U.S.-mediated talks, which are focused exclusively on external involvement in the region. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been prodding the Angolan government to open national reconciliation talks with <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. A key hurdle will come later this month when the parties attempt to reach agreement on a timetable for <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Diplomats have never been more optimistic but <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> is advising caution, insisting that the cease fire is `` the first step of a very long, arduous road'' to peace.

 After a thousand years of <LOCATION> Arab-Persian </LOCATION> hostility and eight of war, peace is a precious but chimeric commodity for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Yet after a year-long <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace effort and two weeks of delicate, for a time deadlocked negotiations, a truce _ if not a lasting peace _ is at hand. On Monday, Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> announced that the guns would fall silent on Aug. 20 and both sides would meet five days later in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for face-to-face peace talks under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices. `` I am persuaded that both nations deeply wanted peace and are committed to it,'' he said. And that opened the way. It also opens the way for improved relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, a reduced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval presence in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and a better atmosphere in which to seek release of foreign hostages held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem fundamentalists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The occasion marks the first time in memory that a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution has been a key to ending a conflict. Numerous resolutions pertaining to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have gone unheeded. Resolution 598 _ the year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> peace plan _ is coming to fruition. The cease-fire announcement was the second major victory for <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> since April, when <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> signed a U.N.-mediated pact providing for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. As in the case of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan and mechanism already was in place when the belligerents turned to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Monday's proclamation also signifies a revival of the financially ailing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> after years of lying fallow and ineffective. Among other tasks, it is now expected to play a peacekeeping role in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. For <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the cease-fire announcement is only the beginning of a long, problematic road. Both belligerents gave way at the bargaining table because of economic and political compulsions; their weariness of war, not their dedication to peace. Both now claim political victory and say the other side gave way. The two shattered nations have nothing to show for the conflict that has claimed up to 1 million lives. The battle lines today are much as they were in September 1980, when <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after a series of border skirmishes. If anything, the bitterness is greater, and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s massive and frequent use of internationally abhorred and outlawed poison gas has increased the enmity. The cease-fire announcement is the culmination of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace efforts that began on July 20, 1987, when the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> adopted Resolution 598, demanding an immediate cease-fire and setting out a peace plan. For a full year, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> negotiated with both sides. Last year, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was losing the war and immediately accepted Resolution 598, which calls for a troop withdrawal, prisoner exchange, establishment of a tribunal to assess responsibility for the damage, formal peace talks and reconstruction. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which was winning, held out. It demanded that as a precondition for peace, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> must be branded the aggressor. For a full year, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was branded the obstructor of peace for not embracing the resolution. Now, a year later, the tables are turned. After a series of battlefield setbacks, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> abruptly announced on July 18 that it was embracing Resolution 598 and urged an immediate cease-fire. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> dropped the precondition of branding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> the aggressor. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s supreme leader, the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, said that making the choice for peace was `` worse than swallowing poison.'' The secretary-general declared he would send a cease-fire mission to both countries and summoned the foreign ministers of both nations for peace talks. But <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which was on the offensive, suddenly demanded direct talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as a precondition of a cease-fire. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said direct talks could be held only after a cease-fire, troop withdrawal and prisoner exchange. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and his Iraqi counterpart, <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but U.N.-mediated negotiations deadlocked over the issue of direct talks. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> appeared to be the peacemaker, while <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> held back. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> then devised a formula under which a truce would be followed rapidly by direct talks on a comprehensive peace. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed immediately. On Saturday, President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said he would go along with direct talks after a cease-fire, dropping his objections. That was the breakthrough. `` The restoration of peace will bring to the peoples of both countries victories far greater than those of war,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Monday.

 Astronomers searching for radio signals from intelligent life beyond the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> say circumstantial evidence is growing that humankind is not alone in the universe. Reports of the discovery of new planets and of the presence of complex organic chemicals on comets are `` encouraging'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s radio search for life, said Monday. Research announced at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s 20th assembly last week showed the discovery of at least 10 planet-like objects in orbit of distant stars Other studies showed that comets and cosmic dust particles contain the complex organic compounds that are thought to have been the chemical precursors of life. `` That is the circumstantial evidence that life exists elsewhere,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. `` We know now that the materials are there. It gives us a good feeling that we are on the right track.'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> heads a project called the Search for <ORGANIZATION> Extraterrestial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION>, or SETI, that is planning to mount an intensified search for radio signals from civilizations that may exist on planets orbiting distant stars. Programs run by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and others have listened for intelligence-directed radio signals for more than 20 years, but only a small fraction of the vast universe and the many radio frequencies that must be monitored actually have been checked. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is operated by the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, has proposed expanding the effort with sophisticated new equipment that would listen to tens of millions of channels at the same time. The equipment would be monitoried by a computer capable of identifying signals that could be sent by intelligent life. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said the new equipment would be able to look at 1,000 different stars that are thought to be similar to the Earth's sun, locations that experts believe hold the best chance for the evolution of life. There also would be `` whole sky survey'' in many radio frequencies in which every portion of the heavens would be searched systematically. Searches in the past `` have only scratched the surface,'' said <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>. The new equipment would be 10 million times more thorough than present equipment, he said, noting, `` In the first few minutes, we would be able to match all of the searches that were done before.'' But even with the new devices, the job is immense, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> SETI </ORGANIZATION> committee of the astronomical union and an astronomer at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>. `` Many people think the project should succeed in the next year or two,'' he said. `` That's probably not going to happen. The universe is so huge and the cosmic haystack so large, it will take us decades.'' But <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> added: `` The consequences of success are so great that it's worth dealing with the problems.'' The theory behind the SETI work is that because there are billions of galaxies, each with billions of stars, the odds are good that the conditions that permitted life to evolve on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> also exist elsewhere. If so, then intelligent life could have developed along the same lines as it did here on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Civilizations that are equal to or more advanced than humankind would be sending out signals, just as occurs on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The SETI project is looking for those signals. Such signals may `` leak out'' just as they do on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said. `` The strongest sign of our existence in the universe is the accumulation of our television signals,'' he said. The second most common radio signal from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> comes from military communications. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said the federal budget now under consideration by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> includes a $ 6 million appropriation for the enhanced <ORGANIZATION> SETI </ORGANIZATION> equipment. He said the total project would last 10 years and cost $ 90 million. If the funding were approved, the intensified search could begin in 1992, with all of the new equipment operating by 1994.

<TEXT>
 She's only fifth in line to the throne, but from the hospital crowds to the headlines, the birth of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s newest princess has shown the royal family working a magic that defies even the experts. `` I ca n't think why there's such hysterical interest really,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON>, editor of <PERSON> Debrett </PERSON>'s Peerage, which chronicles <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s blue bloods. `` But it just keeps increasing ... Maybe it's because there's been a leveling out of social classes _ which is very good, but at the same time does make for rather boring reading,'' <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON> said in an interview `` And these characters are supposed to be a bit bigger than life, or we're led to believe they are,'' he added. And so they seemed Tuesday. Almost all of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s dozen national newspapers splashed across their front pages the Monday night birth of the Princess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>'s second son, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, and his wife, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>. Radio and television networks led bulletins repeatedly with the news, edging out the cease-fire agreement in the Iran-Iraq war. Only the Communist Morning Star and the newest upscale newspaper, the 375,000-circulation Independent, ignored or paid little attention to the birth of the queen's fifth grandchild. `` We are not much interested in minor royals, but we did record the event,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, news editor of the Independent, which gave the story three lines on page 2. `` The Independent's view is that these people do n't matter.'' It was a lonely view. Compared with the attention given to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s other major surviving monarchies _ the Spanish, the Scandinavians, the Dutch and the Belgians _ <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> erupted with royal fever. The monarchs of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> attract plenty of attention among their Scandinavian subjects, but not much elsewhere. In the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, by the time former Queen <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON>'s youngest grandchild, also <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON>, was born in October 1981, interest in royal babies had cooled. The little <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON> was the ex-queen's 13th grandchild. In <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the birth in 1982 of a third child, Princess <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON>, to King <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustaf </PERSON> and <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON>, dominated the local news but did not make world headlines. Royal babies not in direct line to the throne receive scant attention. Only one newspaper in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> mentioned the birth in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> last month of Norwegian King Olav's second great-grandchild. In <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, pictures of King <PERSON> Baudouin </PERSON> and Queen <PERSON> Fabiola </PERSON> seldom appear in then news. The heir to the throne, <PERSON> Baudouin </PERSON>'s nephew, Prince <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>, keeps even further out of the limelight. In contrast, the royal family of the tiny principality of <LOCATION> Monaco </LOCATION> has the photographers in hot pursuit, particularly Princess <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON>, daughters of <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainier </PERSON> and the late <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. But even for them, the scrutiny palls compared to the life of the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> monarch's children and their offspring. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks-Baker </PERSON>, publishing director of <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s Peerage, attributes the publicity given <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, partly to what he says has become an international hobby _ British royal-watching _ and partly to her unusual background for a royal bride. The former <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> had no title, was a commoner, had two serious romances before <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, and pursued her career in a graphic arts company. He believes that historians will credit the former Miss <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> with `` taking the royal family into the 21st century.'' `` From the literally thousands of letters we get _ from Americans, Germans, Japanese _ wanting information about the royal family, it's clear that royal-watching has become as much a hobby as stamp-collecting,'' said <PERSON> Brooks-Baker </PERSON>. The birth of the Princess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> received more publicity in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> than did the birth in 1947 of Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, heir to the throne, he said. `` This interest in things royal is a great snowball ... interesting and also terrifying,'' said <PERSON> Brooks-Baker </PERSON>. `` As this soap opera becomes more and more universal, one wonders where it is going to end and whether it will crush the very people it is portraying. I do n't know.''

 Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> sat alone as he delivered an impassioned plea to a Republican Platform panel, urging his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> brethren to stand firm against apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` The regime in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is no better than the regime in <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the'30s,'' he said. `` That regime tried to do to the Jewish people what <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is doing to the blacks.'' <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, playing a role he perfected in 1984, is practically the sole dissenter in this week's platform deliberations. After <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>'s testimony, conservative activist <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said, `` It looks like Mr. <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> is doing his usual thing: going around making a lot of noise and not getting any votes.'' Alone among prominent Republicans, <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> has taken it upon himself to push for some moderate-to-liberal platform planks, positions that are almost certain not to emerge from the draft for next week's <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform. <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> also has prepared platform proposals calling for support of the Equal Rights Amendment and an activist approach toward the AIDS crisis. He said he plans to press for adoption of the planks in drafting sessions later this week. <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> is generally unpopular among the conservative activists who dominate the Republican platform process, and when his testimony ended, several subcommittee members unburdened themselves of several polite but insistent questions about his anti-apartheid stand. `` What about your call for support for front-line states of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, including Marxist-run <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>?'' `` What further economic sanctions ... you said, an oil embargo, if necessary?'' While <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> was tilting at windmills, witnesses who gave presentations for the Strategic Defense Initiative, a continuation of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration economic policy and support for the Nicaraguan rebels received general and positive queries that enabled them to score easy points. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Ikle </PERSON>, former undersecretary of defense, testified that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should maintain a steady growth in the defense budget, continue its support for anti-communist rebels and work toward the deployment of SDI, the missile defense system known as Star Wars. The question to Ikle: `` What would have happened if the country had adopted <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' views seven years ago?'' Answer: `` We'd be in a period of crisis, rolling out the red carpet for Soviet expansion ... and have no Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty.'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, the former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, testified that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars plan is a `` strategic master stroke,'' comparable to the `` <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Purchase </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Doctrine </LOCATION> and the Apollo space program.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s comments brought smiles to the faces of the subcommittee members. There were no questions. <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> drew a few murmurs in the audience when he first compared <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, citing the government's policy of strict racial segregation of blacks When a panelist sought help to understand that view, <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> said: `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has done by law exactly what <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> did by law,'' he responded. His anti-apartheid plank would say: `` As the historical party of individual rights, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rejects apartheid and seeks its abolition. We believe the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a moral responsibility to impose, in concert with other nations, further economic sanctions _ including an oil embargo, if necessary _ to bring this heinous practice to an end.'' <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> agreed with his questioners that an oil embargo and other economic sanctions probably would hurt the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> financially, but pleaded with the panel's sense of humanity. If that did n't work, there was <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>'s argument that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needed a stronger presence on the African continent, especially in the face of Marxist-led countries such as <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. And if that failed, there was always the comparison with the Democrats, who in their platform labeled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state. `` It should n't be a Democratic issue,'' <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> said, noting that a Republican-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the initial economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> overrode <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto And as he stood up, ready to leave the conference room, <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> _ brandishing his Republicanism _ said defiantly, `` I'm not taking a back seat to the Democrats on any issue ... especially when they have a mealy-mouth platform.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not moved quickly enough on welfare reform and urban renewal, and he told the nation's governors they've been `` way out front'' on many social issues. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a former two-term governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, used a speech to the governors Monday to tout his `` New Federalism'' policy of shifting more responsibility for social programs away from the federal government and onto the states. Many governors, especially Democrats, have complained that the states can not absorb increasing cuts in federal aid while maintaining services for their citizens. During his speech at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s meeting in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> described his effort as one giving states a `` leadership role.'' `` We have broken the federal government of its compulsion to control every breath the states take,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, facing a host of last-minute issues on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> as lawmakers draw near a recess for the Republican National Convention, was playing host to Republican congressional leaders at the White House today. In his <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> complained that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not acted on legislation he submitted six years ago, proposing that the most depressed areas of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cities receive tax breaks to encourage business investment. `` Despite some minor moves last year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> still has failed to pass meaningful enterprise zone legislation,'' he said. `` Not you. Over half the states have gone forward with their own enterprise zones.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said the states have moved more quickly to get people off welfare rolls. `` Welfare reform is another field in which you have been way out front,'' he said. `` Congress today is still debating a welfare reform package _ years after states started taking advantage of the greater flexibility we gave them.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the federal government should not `` merely let the states toss ideas into a suggestion box,'' but that it should `` honor the leadership role the states have to play.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> won compliments from Republican Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, who said the president `` was talking language we understand.'' But Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave a political speech designed mainly to help Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the presidential election. The governor's association has said it wants its meeting to be non-partisan. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said, `` I think it was as political as he could be without stepping out of line.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> toured a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plant, telling managers and employees he resents talk about the `` Rust Belt'' in the nation's <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. `` I get a little tired of hearing <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and other Midwestern cities called the ` Rust Belt' when the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> is n't the ` Rust Belt.' It's the ` Boom Belt.'''

<HEAD>Danish Film Rouses Friends of Turtle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Friends of the endangered sea turtle are upset because a prize-winning Danish film, `` <PERSON> Babette </PERSON>'s Feast,'' has turtle soup on the menu. They are investigating a report from a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> restaurant that it got some sea turtle meat from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> for use in a dinner to promote the film. `` There's a gelatinous substance called calipee under the shell of the sea turtle that's the basis for turtle soup,'' explained <PERSON> Marydele </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, director of the Sea Turtle Rescue Fund, in a telephone interview Monday. `` Actually, the turtle you see beating its flippers in the film seems to be a loggerhead, which is a different species that does n't have the calipee,'' she said `` But both are on the endangered species list and its illegal to catch them in this country.'' The film is based on a short story by Danish writer <PERSON> Isak </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinesen </PERSON>, pen name of the late <PERSON> Baroness </PERSON> <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Blixen-Finecke </PERSON>, who also wrote `` Out of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' `` <PERSON> Babette </PERSON>'s Feast'' tells of a Frenchwoman living on the coast of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> who spends her lottery winnings on a big dinner for the villagers who have befriended her in her long exile. The Motion Picture Academy awarded it an Oscar as the best foreign film of the year. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane-Zucker </PERSON>, who is helping promote the film for <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Classics </ORGANIZATION>, said its food consultant has worked up substitute recipes using shitake mushrooms and chopped breast of duck. About 90 restaurants have been interested in reproducing the seven-course meal, he said. Ms. <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> said some restaurants are using diamondback terrapin, which is not a sea turtle but is found in estuaries and considered endangered in some places. Ms. <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> says 10,000 terrapin a year are sold in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> fish markets and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turtle </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tortoise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> is trying to get it put on the state's endangered list Groceries sell a `` mock turtle soup,'' which she says is made from land turtles. They are not on anyone's endangered list, but she would prefer nobody ate turtle soup at all. `` Turtles in the Soup: Recipe for Disaster'' is the title of an article written by Ms. <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> for the August issue of `` CEE Report,'' published by the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, sea turtles were n't faring well in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, where the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation to bar the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration temporarily from carrying out a plan to require shrimp fishermen to use devices to protect the reptiles. Turtles often drown when snared in shrimp nets. The bill, sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by voice vote, would prohibit the mandatory use of so-called turtle excluder devices before Sept. 30, a month after excluder-device regulations were slated to take effect. The delay would give <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators time to work out differences in their versions of legislation to reauthorize the Endangered Species Act. Both bills would prohibit the required use of excluder devices in inshore waters until May 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill also would ban device regulations for offshore waters until next May.

<HEAD>Some Bribery Reported Helping Third World</HEAD>
<HEAD>By CARL HARTMAN</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some bribes can help Third World countries get ahead and can make a `` positive contribution to society,'' a politics professor writes in a magazine published by an affiliate of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Osterfeld </PERSON>, who teaches politics at <ORGANIZATION> Saint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rensselaer </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, argues that it is useful to a country if a government charges $ 1,000 for a license to enter an occupation but an official issues one for a bribe of $ 900. `` The reduced cost facilitates entry into the field, thereby introducing an element of competition into an otherwise monopolistic situation,'' he says in an article called `` Corruption and Development.'' <PERSON> Osterfeld </PERSON>'s article appears in the current issue of the quarterly `` Journal of Economic Growth,'' published by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The foundation is a research affiliate of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, a private business organization. The trade bill now awaiting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s signature will ease the effect of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and make it easier for executives here to defend themselves when their agents are charged with paying bribes abroad. Osterfeld does n't defend all bribes, saying that some are `` wicked.'' `` For instance, the alleged involvement of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> ` s -LRB- military ruler Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in the drug trade is a case of corruption in all of its wickedness, where society is clearly hurt,'' he says. `` However, a Peruvian street vendor's bribing of a low-level government official in order to obtain a license to sell his wares, while also a corrupt act, makes a positive contribution to society,'' he wrote. <PERSON> Osterfeld </PERSON> says that even if the bribe is several times the size of the license fee _ as an Indian investigating committee found was often the case _ the bribe is still useful. `` -LRB- It -RRB- not only benefits the bureaucrat, but, more importantly, insures that the licenses are allocated efficiently, since those able to offer the highest bribes are the most productive and efficient firms,'' he adds. There was disagreement from <PERSON> Lilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferro-Clerico </PERSON>, a Uruguayan who coordinates <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and Central American studies for <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's pretty far-fetched,'' she said in a telephone interview. `` I do n't think corruption is ever helpful. You have a parallel here in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> scandal _ all the bribes did was to make it more expensive for the taxpayer.'' <PERSON> Osterfeld </PERSON> defends what he calls `` expansive corruption,'' which he says increases chances for trade that benefits a country. `` It entails increased competition and market flexibility,'' he says. `` The result is that the quantity of goods produced expands and their quality improves. It is, in short, characterized by the expansion of the overall wealth of society. `` -LRB- It -RRB- is morally defensible since its goal is to defend one's own property as well as one's right to engage in voluntary activities. As examples of `` expansive corruption'' he suggests: _ Evading price controls or tariffs by bribes to officials to permit smuggling or black marketing _ Bribes to evade licensing restrictions or controls on immigration and emigration Bribing a judge in cases of smuggling, occupational licenses, black marketing and price controls are called `` defensive bribing'' and <LOCATION> Osterfeld </LOCATION> classifies that as expansive as well. `` Even if society becomes demoralized or disillusioned by such corruption, the effects may not be an impediment to development ...,'' he adds. He explains that the cynicism may lead to increased self-seeking that furthers development. <PERSON> Osterfeld </PERSON> concludes that `` expansive corruption'' is a response to government restrictions on economic freedom. Those concerned about it, who want economic development, should concentrate on reducing government action that tempts corruption, he says.

 Baseball after dark dawned Monday at <LOCATION> Wrigley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, the last major-league ballpark with day-only games, but rain put out the lights early. The first night game in the 74-year history of <LOCATION> Wrigley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, between the <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phillies </ORGANIZATION>, was delayed by a downpour in the bottom of the fourth inning. It was officially postponed two hours, 15 minutes later, wiping out the <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION>' 3-1 lead, since the game will have to be replayed. <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> led off by hitting a home run into the left-center field seats of <LOCATION> Wrigley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, which for 40 years had been the sole major league ballpark to hold out against lights. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> fans' mood brightened, however, after the home team came back with a first inning homer by <PERSON> Ryne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandberg </PERSON>. The Cubs, mired in fourth place in the National League East Division, scored two more runs before thundershowers forced a delay. `` God is talking,'' said 26-year-old <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>, who had just fled the stadium. `` He does n't want night games at <LOCATION> Wrigley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>.'' Authorities reported at least five arrests through the rain delay, including three for ticket scapling and two vendor violations, but few other problems, except for illegally parked cars. Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> toured the surrounding <LOCATION> Wrigleyville </LOCATION> neighborhood before entering the park and predicted that residents, some of whom equate Cubs baseball with daylight, would get used to night games. `` I think as we advance the whole plan and get people used to night games I'm optimistic it will eventually smooth out,'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> said. `` It's a historical moment, but it disturbs me because I do n't want people to use my gangway as a bathroom or throw bottles in my alley,'' said <PERSON> Carmelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, 32, a <LOCATION> Wrigley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> neighbor painting his fence Monday afternoon `` We live here and the people in this neighborhood take care of it. But some fans just do n't respect the community,'' he said. Even President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was struck by the history of the moment. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, boarding Air Force One in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> on Monday, was asked what he thought of the first night baseball game at <LOCATION> Wrigley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>. `` I'm too old-fashioned,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who early in his radio career did re-enactments of Cubs' games for stations in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` There's nothing like daytime baseball. But I understand the need for lights _ box office.'' <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police scheduled 172 officers, including mounted police and canine units, and revved up 15 tow trucks for illegally parked cars. The normal phalanx for day games is about 50 police, said Officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kernan </PERSON>. Permit parking is available only for residents of the neighborhood of turn-of-the century, two - and three-flat apartments that is becoming upscale from its working-class roots Outside the park Monday, the excitement began early. Throngs of fans _ some of whom had been there since 8 p.m. Sunday for the best of the general admission bleacher seats _ lined the streets, while T-shirt vendors hawked homemade wares. Some of the parking lot operators near the park put up new prices, $ 15 in one case. Ivy-covered Wrigley Field held on to daytime-only baseball decades longer than any other ballpark in the nation, joining the fraternity of the illumined 40 years after the last team to light up _ the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted in February to lift the ban on lights, and lights are scheduled to burn brightly in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> stadium seven times this season and 18 times next season. The $ 5 million lighting system has already added a modern flare to the blue and white <LOCATION> Wrigley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, which was built in 1914 to house the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Whales of the short-lived <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. There were more than a few attempts to pull the plug on lights even before 91-year-old Cubs fan <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> could throw a ceremonial switch to illuminate the field for the first time. The <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, announced soon after it bought the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 that it intended to put lights in the ballpark, saying day-only baseball cost the company revenue from televised night games. But <LOCATION> Wrigleyville </LOCATION> residents took on the media company and managed to keep the ban on lights alive for almost seven years. <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baseball </ORGANIZATION> in the Sunshine _ <ORGANIZATION> CUBS </ORGANIZATION> _ spearheaded efforts that included lobbying city and state officials. The group decried problems with rowdy crowds, traffic and parking it said would accompany night games. <ORGANIZATION> CUBS </ORGANIZATION> planned to monitor the neighborhood Monday for material to use in a planned court action to limit night games, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, the group's vice president. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> refused to give details of the court battle, but said it would begin Wednesday. The end of an era also brought out the entrepreneur in some neighbors. `` My mom rented out our roof to some suburban rich people,'' <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, 19, said Monday afternoon at his home across from the ballpark. `` She's even got a gate around the top so if they get drunk they wo n't fall off the side.''

<HEAD>Senate Approves Legislation To Streamline Licensing for New
Nuclear Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear power industry _ its image tarnished by events such as Three Mile Island which led to a decade-long dearth of construction of new nuclear plants _ is mounting a comeback in the waning weeks of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. First, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have sent President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> legislation that would continue the industry's protection _ unique in federal law _ against being required to pay unlimited amounts of money to victims of a reactor accident. And on Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation long sought by the nuclear industry to streamline the licensing process for new nuclear plants and to attempt to revitalize the moribund <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> uranium industry. Industry spokesman have said that a new licensing process, along with a standardized plant design they hope the process will produce, will break the drought that has seen no new nuclear plant construction in this decade. The licensing and uranium provisions were added on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor to legislation that would convert the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> from a five-member panel to a <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> headed by a chief administrator. The bill, approved 89-6, also would strengthen <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> procedures for investigating nuclear plant accidents and wrongdoing by <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> employees. However, none of the several <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committees that share jurisdiction over the legislation has held hearings on all of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill's many elements. It was considered unlikely that the complex legislation would clear <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the five weeks remaining on the schedule for the 1988 session. The liability bill sent to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a 15-year renewal of the 1957 Price-Anderson Act, would set $ 7.1 billion as the maximum amount the owners of nuclear generators would have to pay in damages arising from a single accident. That amount is 10 times the previous liability cap. It is about triple what the industry was lobbying for. But it could have been far worse from the industry's standpoint. Some government reports have estimated that a major nuclear accident could cause $ 100 billion in damages. Environmental groups and the <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> organization had been pushing for unlimited liability for the industry. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> say it is likely that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will sign the <ORGANIZATION> Price-Anderson </ORGANIZATION> reauthorization, which leaves it to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to decide how to find the money needed to pay more than $ 7.1 billion in damages. Barring an accident requiring large payments to victims, the higher liability limit is not expected to have any major impact on electricity rates charged by utilities with nuclear plants, according to congressional staffers. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, added the amendment Monday to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> restructuring bill that would scrap the process under which a new plant must get separate construction and operating licenses from the agency. The industry has blamed much of its problems in getting new plants built on the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s two-step process. It has said that a single license would spur development of cheaper, standardized plant designs. The uranium industry also won a long-sought provision with a 78-17 vote for an amendment that would force plant operators to pay a federal fee if they obtain more than 37.5 percent of their reactor uranium from foreign sources. The amendment by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, also would create government-owned corporation to take over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> uranium enrichment program and spend $ 750 million to acquire up to 30 million pounds of uranium by 1996 Their plan also would authorize spending about $ 1 billion to clean up uranium tailings _ the waste created by uranium mining activities in Western states. Voting against the bill Monday were <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore.; <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt.; and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Congress Sends Fair Housing Bill to Reagan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fair housing bill, the first major expansion of civil rights laws in two decades, is heading to the White House for the signature of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who has endorsed the measure. The legislation gives federal officials new power to enforce fair housing laws and extends anti-discrimination protection to the disabled and families with children. The bill was approved Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with no debate. Final congressional passage came in a nearly deserted chamber as a few <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members concurred by voice vote in amendments approved last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The original fair housing law, passed in 1968 after the assassination of civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, gave the federal government only a mediation role in settling housing disputes. Under the new bill, the secretary of housing and urban development is empowered to go to court to seek stiff fines against property owners accused of discrimination. Current protections against racial and sexual discrimination are extended to the handicapped and to families with children under 18. In addition, the bill says new residences with at least four units would have to be accessible to the handicapped. The added protection for families with young children effectively ends `` adults only'' restrictions, except for exemptions for retirement communities for the elderly.

<HEAD>Panel Drops Plan To Give National Party More Authority Over State
Parties</HEAD>

 Republicans may have to wait until the 1996 election to break the ties that bind their party to following the wishes of state legislatures controlled by Democrats. A GOP panel on Monday dropped a proposal to give the national party more centralized authority, a notion that makes many Republicans squeamish because that's how the Democrats operate. The decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, if left standing by the convention next week, means the party's current system for picking national convention delegates will remain in place through the 1992 presidential primaries and caucuses. `` One way or another, we ought to be masters of our own fate,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> general counsel who asked for the withdrawal of his proposal to centralize <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> authority. `` I think the Democrats have done a lot of damage to themselves with their rules,'' said <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulton </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> national committeewoman from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> who advocated a rival proposal that would have given state parties the right to overrule state laws governing party procedures. `` I just think to have any kind of national committee or group approving state party rules is the wrong way to go,'' she said. Dropping the two competing proposals was part of a compromise worked out earlier this summer, Ms. <PERSON> Boulton </PERSON> said. Republican rules currently require state parties to adhere to local laws, such as those establishing and scheduling primaries, in picking their national convention delegates. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the problem with this is `` there are 36 states where we do not control the legislatures'' and thus Democrats are allowed to govern what ought to be matters of internal <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> policy. The issue arose during the 1988 election, when Southern state legislatures controlled by <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> decided to hold their primaries on one day, which became known as Super Tuesday, March 8. Some Republican state parties raised objections but were powerless to do anything more. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions have said that the parties, not the states, have the final say over their internal operations, including the selection of delegates to presidential nominating conventions. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said that under those decisions, the national parties clearly have the authority to overrule state law, but it is unclear whether state parties can exercise the same authority. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is considering a case dealing with that very issue, but <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said he did not believe the ruling would go in favor of the state parties. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said his proposal was not intended to allow the national party to meddle in state party affairs, but he acknowledged there was a fear it would put the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> `` on the slippery slope to where the Democrats are.''

<TEXT>
 Novelist <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON>, who created joy of life with `` Zorba the Greek'' and a religious storm with `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' remains popular in his native land 30 years after his death. His novels sell thousands of copies every year, mainly in Greek but also in English, French, German and Japanese. He is believed to be the most-read writer in modern Greek. `` We have a huge turnover in the half-dozen major <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON> novels. ... In Greek he's mostly bought by young people, and then the tourists pick up the foreign language copies,'' said <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dokimakis </PERSON>. He owns a leading bookstore in <LOCATION> Heraklion </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>, the island where <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON> was born. <PERSON> Dokimakis </PERSON> said the two most popular novels are `` Zorba,'' an exuberant portrayal set on <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> of a man with a huge zest for life, and `` Last Temptation,'' which presents <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as a weak, unstable man who doubts his divinity and dreams of making love to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON>, the reformed sinner. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cacoyannis </PERSON>' award-winning 1963 film version of `` Zorba the Greek,'' starring <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, has become a classic. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>'s `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' to be released Friday, has provoked protest and outrage by Christian groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Such a reaction comes as no surprise in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The Greek Orthodox Church condemned the book as heretical when it was published in 1954 and nearly excommunicated <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Moustakis </PERSON>, a Greek theologian, said <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON> escaped excommunication `` only because the Cretans were so angry they threatened to burn every church on the island if it went through.'' `` There's still a puritan streak in American life that's bound to be offended by the film,'' he added, `` and I'm sure that its release in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> will bring protests from the church.'' The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> also blacklisted the novel in 1954. Italian director <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeffirelli </PERSON> said he would withdraw his `` Young <PERSON> Toscanini </PERSON>'' from the <ORGANIZATION> Venice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> later this month if <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>'s movie was scheduled to be shown just before or after it. <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON> acknowledged strong personal identification with the tormented character of Christ he portrayed, but said the book was an affirmation of faith. `` I am certain that every free man who reads this book, so filled as it is with love, will more than ever before ... love Christ,'' he wrote in the introduction. On <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>, the largest <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> island with a population of 550,000, <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON> is a hero symbolizing its tradition of radicalism and defiant independence. He was born in 1883 into a farm family and studied in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. As a young man, he spent six months in a Greek Orthodox monastery on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Athos </LOCATION>, but later embraced a range of philosophies that included Marxism, Buddhism and nihilism, the denial of all meaning in life. <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON> turned to novels late in life after completing what he called his life's work, the 33,000-line philosophical poem `` The Odyssey: a Modern Sequel.'' He settled in <LOCATION> Antibes </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, but always had fistful of earth from <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> in his study. When he died in 1957, <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON> was internationally acclaimed but embittered by his failure to win the Nobel Prize for literature. He blamed that on the Greek literary establishment. `` He was always an outsider who never got along with the other literary personalities of his day like -LRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Seferis </PERSON>,'' a Greek poet who won the prize, said <PERSON> Katerina </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeliki-Rooke </PERSON>, a poet. Her family knew <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON> well. `` The establishment here still chooses to ignore him,'' she said. `` There's been no serious intellectual study of his work in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>.'' A <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON> revival started seven years ago when Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s new Socialist government made him required reading in public high schools. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyriakakis </PERSON>, 15, of <LOCATION> Heraklion </LOCATION> said: `` I love his books, the way he uses the language, the strange words and the great big ideas. He's inspirational.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> keeps official silence on <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON>, but lay religious organizations still describe his work as blasphemous. Many literary critics dismiss his philosophy as naive and his dialect style as exaggerated and self-conscious. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicellis </PERSON>, a novelist, reflected a common view among Greek writers: `` I find <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON> hopelessly old-fashioned. His ideas belong in the 19th century and he forces the Greek language into a rigid, unpleasant mold,'' Readers disagree, and enthusiasm for <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON> surmounts social and regional differences. Ms. <PERSON> Angeliki-Rooke </PERSON> said: `` He catches the popular imagination in a way that no other modern Greek writer has done. In a Greek home with only a few books, one of them will surely be a Kazantzakis.''

 <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Republicans spent more than six months feuding over control of the party, and at the end of a four-hour hearing on seating the state's delegation at the national convention, they wanted more time. The <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> GOP, which was overrun earlier this year by dissidents and supporters of television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, has tried to regroup after local conventions dissolved into shoving matches, bullhorns and allegations of death threats. Moments after the state committee's counsel completed his summation, the attorney for the challengers asked for an additional 10 minutes to present evidence. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contests </ORGANIZATION>, ruled that that the case was closed. But <PERSON> Brant </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON>, chairman of the dissident delegation, stood up and asked to speak as a private citizen whose reputation had been brought into question. The hearing remained closed. The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has been asked to settle challenges to as many as 39 of the 48 delegates from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee-to-be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the Super Tuesday primary but backers of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> have tried to take over the state party. The committee, which ended the hearing after hours of testimony, videotape presentations and boxes of evidence, planned to rule sometime later in closed-door session and will announce its decision when it reports to the full <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. `` What we are engaged in here today is not a petty squabble,'' <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> GOP Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told the committee. <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> said that this was the `` opening battle in a war for control of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'' by `` zealots'' and `` traditional malcontents.'' However, both <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, the attorney for the opposing side, said the dispute was more complicated than a disagreement over presidential politics. `` The element of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been greatly exaggerated by the news media,'' said <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, `` and picked up by the opposition.'' In fact, any decision over seating a delegation from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> will not affect how the state's presidential votes are cast next week at the national convention, but it will determine who casts them. Because <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the March 8 primary, all 48 <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> delegates are required to vote for him at the national convention, but the delegates themselves are picked through a process of caucuses and conventions. It is in that process where the dissidents made their moves, showing up in sufficient numbers to dominate the caucuses and obtaining a series of court orders to counter attempts by the state party to thwart them. The feud led to fistfights and shoving matches at one congressional district convention and to an aborted state convention where dissidents with bullhorns controlled the floor, shouting down speakers on the podium. `` Any reasonable person would concur in my opinion that I had to adjourn the convention to prevent a riot,'' <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> said of his decision to gavel a close to the May convention. `` There was a clear and present danger of mayhem.'' As evidence, the state party showed a nine-minute videotape that was a montage of television news stories about the district and state conventions. The tape did show shouting and fist shaking at the state convention but it did not show any violence there. <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> said he had been under guard because of a death threat he had received at his hotel room in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. The challengers responded with their own videotape of the state convention, showing <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> gaveling the event to order. Later, after motions to replace the chairman, <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> gaveled the convention closed. The tape also showed the dissident delegates locked out of the convention hall. The state party spent much of Monday laying out its case, while <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> used much of the dissidents' time to cross-examine the party's witnesses. Either side can appeal the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to the Credentials Committee of the national convention. The ultimate authority on challenges is the national convention itself.

The four chairmen asked the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to investigate whether the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has violated ederal election law by exceeding spending limits. `` We file this complaint today to formally raise the issues of whether or not <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has mismanaged his campaign funds and overspent the legal limit,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, one of the filers and president of <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairs. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>, spokesman for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, called it a `` partisan challenge'' and said the campaign would welcome any inquiry by the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think it's ridiculous,'' said <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>. `` This campaign has bent over backwards to comply with the letter and the spirit of the law.'' <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said that as of June 30, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had spent $ 22.1 million of the $ 23.1 million he is allowed to spend for all pre-nomination campaign activities. That, <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said, left <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with only $ 943,000 to spend from July 1 through Aug. 18, when he is expected to receive the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has spent an average of about $ 1 million per month since March and traveled extensively in July, going to 15 cities in 14 states. `` Frankly, we as state chairs wonder just how he is able to do all of the traveling that he's doing and all the campaigning he's doing in our states on that relatively limited amount of money,'' said <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> `` It appears to us that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign is using a variety of techniques to avoid the spending cap.'' <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said those techniques may include delaying the reporting of campaign expenditures, trying to take unlawful advantage of a loophole by allocating to state party committees or the national committee travel costs for so-called `` party building activities,'' and characterizing some trips as official business when they are essentially campaign appearances. `` As state chairs, we believe that from our observation violations have occurred,'' said <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>. In their complaint, the four chairmen ask the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> to conduct an immediate investigation into whether and by how much <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has exceeded the spending limit, to issue an order to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign to stop spending federal funds, and to suspend payment of any outstanding matching funds that still may be owed to the campaign. In addition to <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>, the other chairmen filing the complaint were <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruvolo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Holleman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>.

 Next week's Republican National Convention will have a distinct <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> accent, says the man who will nominate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for president. `` It is clear in this convention that I'm doing the nominating and another Texan's doing the accepting, and that's pretty much what conventions are about. So it's a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> show from that point of view,'' Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, said Monday. However, <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said, those watching the GOP convention will hear something quite different from last month's Democratic convention, where <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> set the tone with several wisecracks about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during her keynote speech including that the wealthy vice president was `` born with a silver foot in his mouth.'' `` You're going to see a stark contrast between my speech and the speeches you heard at the Democratic convention,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said he plans to use his speech to highlight the differences between Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I am not a good name-caller. People do n't care what I think about <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in terms of some cutesy-poo thing I might call him,'' he said. Still, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Republicans have a tough act to follow. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials have referred jokingly to last month's Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> as their state convention due to the prominent role played by Texans. Among them were Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the vice presidential nominee; Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, the keynoter; <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, convention chairman; former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, who seconded <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s nomination; Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>, who gave a prime-time speech, and state Rep. <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Austin </LOCATION>, who helped present the party platform to delegates. Democrats also believe the selection of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate will help their ticket carry <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the nation's third-largest state, and its 29 electoral A total of 270 electoral votes are needed to win the presidency. `` The campaign in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is going to be a hotly contested campaign,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said. `` We've got to put before the people of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> those two records. If we do n't win in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> given <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record, we do n't deserve to win.''

 Discovery of a buried World War II bomb by construction crews caused massive traffic jams in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> and forced the temporary evacuation of 250 people, police said. The 500-pound bomb was found Monday evening in a residential area near the center of the city, and cars and trucks were rerouted by police as a precaution, snarling traffic. The bomb was safely disarmed about an hour after it was found, police said. They said they did not know whether the bomb was British or American.

<HEAD>Hollywood Stars Back Chavez In His Fast To Promote Table Grape
Boycott</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Hollywood stars turned out to support a boycott of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> table grapes by farm labor union leader <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, who is bedridden in a hunger strike over pesticides. Monday was the 23rd day of his water-only fast, an effort to gain support for the 4-year-old boycott that has been virtually ignored by the public. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> were among the stars who met six at a time Monday in private with <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> before talking with reporters. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>'s fast has boosted levels of uric acid in his system, threatening to cause kidney failure, his doctors said. `` A man -LRB- <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> -RRB- is putting his life on the line so you will wake up and save your own,'' said actress <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON>, who appeared in the film `` Zoot Suit.'' <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON> was joined by about 20 actors who said that five pesticides used on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> table grapes threaten consumers, farm workers and the environment. Growers deny that table grapes contain dangerous pesticide residues. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union has no contracts among <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> table grape growers and the union has lost 30,000 dues-paying members during the last decade. Monday's meetings in this town 200 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was presided over by <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, creator of `` Zoot Suit'' and a longtime <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> friend. <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> led a `` meditation,'' asking all to hold hands. `` Let my country awake,'' he said as he ended his prayer, with the stars raising their clasped hands. `` The problem we are addressing today is silent and invisible. It is the poison brought to us on our food,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> of TV's old `` M-A-S-H'' series. <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Haid </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> Renko </PERSON> on the old `` Hill Street Blues'' series, said, `` Wake up! Your children will be the next victims. The children here are the victims.'' Asked about the labor leader's condition, actor <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Spano </PERSON> of `` Hill Street Blues,'' said: `` He's happy for our support and he's waiting to end his fast He wants to end it.'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Obbink </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Table </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, denied that table grapes contain dangerous pesticide residues and said <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> has a hidden political agenda in a dispute over administration of the state's labor laws. `` If -LRB- <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> -RRB- was really worried about the consumers' health and the farm workers' health, then he would be saying ban the chemicals from all products. The chemicals he's concerned about are used in nearly every state in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and nearly everything in the produce department,'' he said.

<HEAD>Alternative Service To Be Introduced Next Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communist authorities say they will next year introduce an alternative for those who refuse compulsory 18-month military service, making <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> the second East bloc country to offer the option. While general compulsory service would remain in effect, the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION> said Monday, `` in consideration of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s national and international interests, citizens are to be given a choice ...'' In June, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> became the first <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact country to establish an alternative civilian service. Last week, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official disclosed that 590 conscientious objectors have refused to serve under arms in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> since 1977. <PERSON> Ferenc </PERSON> <PERSON> Szombathelyi </PERSON>, deputy head of department in the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said 40 to 45 young people have been jailed annually for refusing to bear arms `` This practice must be changed now,'' he told the party daily <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION>. At present, people who refuse mandatory military service in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for reasons of conscience or religion are imprisoned for up to five years. However, <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witnesses, members of the Church of the Nazarene and Seventh-Day Adventists are exempted from military service. According to <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION>, the alternative service `` is not to be punitive in nature, nor more attractive than the armed service, and carries no -LRB- material -RRB- advantages.'' `` The substitutory civilian service, the introduction of which will require amendments in the defense law, will be adjusted to the 18-month long regular -LRB- military -RRB- national service,'' the daily said without elaboration.

 Tropical Storm <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> hovered off the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coast Monday, forcing the evacuation of thousands of oil rig workers in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and driving vacationers away from rain-drenched coastal resorts. Amid warnings of coastal tides five to seven feet above normal, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> officials evacuated the fishing villages of <LOCATION> Hopedale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yscloskey </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> late Monday night. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> was upgraded Monday from a tropical depression after its winds strengthened, reaching a sustained speed of 50 mph with higher gusts in squalls up to 75 miles from the center. The storm formed inland over <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontchartrain </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and strengthened as it drifted closer to the warm Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The storm did n't deter Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from visiting <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on Monday where he addressed the 1988 Republican Platform Committee. The Republican National Convention will be next week <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superdome </ORGANIZATION>. `` Better this week than next week,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, convention manager. At midnight EDT, the storm's center was near latitude 29.5 north and longitude 89.0 west, or about 65 miles southeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. It had remained stationary for about six hours, after earlier drifting slowly southeastward. Forecasters said <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> was expected to begin a slow southerly or southwesterly drift Tuesday with some strengthening possible and possible flooding especially in coastal communities east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` It's highly unusual for depressions to form over land. Most of the time they get their start way out in the middle of the ocean,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` We do n't have a lot of experience with systems that form this way.'' A tropical weather system becomes a named storm when its winds hit 39 mph, and a hurricane when wind velocity reaches 74 mph. Residents of south <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, especially in coastal communities, were warned to prepare for flooding from high tides. `` Right now we're advising people to listen to their radios and watch television,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Valence </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, about 40 miles south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Tropical storm warnings were posted from <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>; a small vessels warning was in effect from <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> O'Connor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifa </PERSON> said about 2,000 company workers were removed Monday by boat and helicopter from facilities at <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leeville </LOCATION> deep in <LOCATION> Plaquemines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> and at <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` The concern is that the more it gets into the Gulf, the more winds pick up. It is something we are very concerned about,'' <PERSON> Lifa </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Shugart </PERSON>, area manager for <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, expected to spend the day getting workers out of danger. `` It looks like we're in for a full day of flying,'' he said. `` We'll just keep flying for as long as we can or until most of it is over.'' <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> is the second named storm of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season. The season's first tropical storm, <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON>, fizzled out Monday near the Canadian coast. Shortly after noon Sunday, the forecasters had issued a tropical storm warning for <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s coast from <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Eastport </LOCATION>, but canceled it in less than six hours. Rain from <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> battered coastal areas Monday in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and some tourists cut their vacations short. `` We've had a lot of checkouts,'' said <PERSON> JoAn </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>, general manager at the 102-room Econo-Lodge in <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who manages the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said guests who checked out early Monday complained about the weather `` They do n't want to get stuck in the event of a big storm,'' she said. Meteorologist <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriehn </PERSON> in Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said residents there could expect 5 or 6 inches of rain in the next day or two. But he said <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> could sit in the Gulf two or three days until it gains strength or dies. Typically, there are 10 named storms during the six-month hurricane season, which begins June 1. Last year, there were only three hurricanes and four tropical storms in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. The last major Gulf Coast hurricane was <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> in 1969, with 218 mph winds. It killed 320 people and did millions in damage.

 A typhoon that killed more than 50 people and left at least 100 missing cut off power to the city of <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION> and brought disaster to the coastal province of <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> for the third time this year. The typhoon buffetted northern <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> on Monday with winds of 75 mph, uprooting trees, sinking boats and inflicting what the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> called the nation's heaviest economic losses from a storm in 30 years. The People's Daily -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Renmin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ribao </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- put the death toll at more than 50 in the three cities of <LOCATION> Ningbo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Huzhou </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jiaxing </LOCATION>, saying figures on casualties and damage were still incomplete. The storm hit <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION>, the provincial capital with a population of 1.2 million, before dawn, ripping down trees and power lines and cutting off electricity and water supplies, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. The overseas edition of the People's Daily said the storm sank 72 boats in the <LOCATION> Qiantang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and off the coast, and that 110 fishermen and sailors were missing. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said two fishermen were killed. It said several people were electrocuted in <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION>, but gave no figures.

An official of the provincial <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiliang </PERSON>, said by telephone that electricity had been restored to some parts of the city and that water was again running.

A Western reporter there said the storm uprooted hundreds of trees, including those around the scenic <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, a major tourist attraction in what is regarded as one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most beautiful cities. The typhoon hit near <LOCATION> Ningbo </LOCATION>, a coastal city about 93 miles east of <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION> that bore the brunt of a major flooding disaster in late July.

<HEAD>House OKs Bill To Combat Illegal Ivory Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House has approved legislation to bring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into line with an international agreement to combat illegal trafficking in African elephant ivory. The measure sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by voice vote on Monday would prohibit imports into this country of any ivory taken in violation of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. That worldwide agreement uses a system of quotas and ivory markings in an effort to regulate the international trade in ivory from African elephants, whose numbers have fallen to an estimated 700,000 from 1.5 million in 1979. The bill would ban importation of raw ivory from any nation without a native elephant population and would prohibit exportation of raw ivory from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Federal Appeals Court Upholds Minnesota Abortion-Notification Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> appeals court ruling upholding a law requiring minors seeking abortions to notify both parents or get judicial permission will have disastrous effects, a civil liberties lawyer says. But a leader of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s largest anti-arbortion lobby said the ruling will provide needed safeguards for pregnant teen-agers. The 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, by a 7-3 vote, overturned decisions by a federal judge and a three-judge panel of the appeals court. The earlier rulings deemed the law unconstitutional. <PERSON> Rachael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pine </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, called Monday's ruling was `` a disaster for minors in the state of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> brought the class action lawsuit on behalf of minors, a parent, four clinics and two physicians. <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwietz </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concerned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>, an anti-abortion group, said the ruling `` affirms the right of minor girls to have their parents involved in this important medical decision.'' `` It's always amazed me that abortionists performing surgery on a child would do so without knowing the impact on her health,'' <PERSON> Schwietz </PERSON> said. `` There's no way you can get an adequate history on the girl without parental involvement. There are facts that may only be available to the abortionist from the parents.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsop </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> in November 1986 barred the state from enforcing the notification law. <PERSON> Alsop </PERSON> said the required 48-hour notice to both parents unduly burdened a minor's right to seek an abortion, particularly when the pregnant girl does not live with both parents. But Appeals Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, writing for the majority, said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> `` has recognized as a matter of law that parental notice or consent requirements do not unconstitutionally burden a minor's abortion rights when an appropriate judicial bypass is in place.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> legalized abortion in its landmark 1973 decision based on women's right to control her body. But in 1981, it allowed states to impose parental-notification requirements for `` immature'' girls still dependent on their parents. <PERSON> Pine </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> case was the nation's first in which the courts considered a law involving restrictions on minors' access to abortion that had been enforced. `` All other cases before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and lower courts have been challenges brought before the laws took effect,'' <PERSON> Pine </PERSON> said. `` The others were based on speculation.'' <PERSON> Pine </PERSON> said a decision whether to appeal the ruling to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was being considered. Twenty-five states have laws that require minors seeking abortions to notify or to obtain consent from at least one parent, <PERSON> Pine </PERSON> said. Most of them allow minors to seek judicial approval to get around the parental notification or consent requirement. In a dissenting opinion, Judge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lay </PERSON> said the majority `` completely ignores the evidence amassed in a five-week trial and the district court's findings of fact as irrelevant to the constitutional issues.'' The majority, Lay said, `` has created a new right, apparently of constitutional dimension, for non-custodial parents to receive notice of their minor children's activities.'' Upholding the 48-hour waiting period, Lay said, was `` contrary to nearly every other court decision on this issue.''

 A luxury car, jewerly, clothes and other items <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> allegedly purchased with money donated for her dying son's liver transplants must be returned today, a judge has ruled. <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> on Monday gave Ms. DeSillers until 5 p.m. to turn over the property, which includes a BMW automobile with cellular phone, more than $ 11,000 in jewelry and a cemetery plot next to her son's grave. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> also said Monday he will rule later this week on whether to charge Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> with contempt for allegedly withholding financial information from court-appointed curator <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON>. `` When is it all going to end?'' responded Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>, who indicated she would appeal the ruling. `` I lost <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>. I lost it all and they still want to keep on punching me.'' Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> is accused of misusing some of nearly $ 689,000 donated for her 7-year-old son's three unsuccessful operations, including $ 1,000 from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The curator says the return of the items will aid the court's efforts to account for the funds, even though Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> says she bought the items with much of her own money `` I'm really upset about what has happened, because I feel it is unfair,'' Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> said. `` I feel the whole proceedings have not focused on what the truth is, but is making up what they think the truth is.'' Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' son, <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>, died in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s Children's Hospital in April 1987 while awaiting his fourth liver transplant A $ 262,000 medical bill remains unpaid because Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> says her son received inadequate medical care. Last month, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> ruled Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> must give some of the remaining $ 240,000 of the donations to groups helping needy and sick children. A computer purchased by <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> was supposed to be used for the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Ronnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DeSillers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. As head of the foundation, Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> paid herself about $ 88,000 in salary and other cash payments, Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> said. She also gave a total of about $ 40,000 to her brother, ex-husband, and ex-boyfriend, Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> said. `` During this time, she did not work or have any other source of income on her own,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> said. `` It was clear to me that all the purchases ... were made with funds that were donated.'' On Aug. 1, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> police concluded Ms. DeSillers' fingerprints do not match those found last year at an elementary school where about $ 4,000 in donations for <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> was reported stolen Police would not say what information led them to request her fingerprints. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, an attorney for Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>, unsuccessfully argued that she wanted to keep the cemetery plot so she could be buried next to her son. `` That hurts the most,'' a teary-eyed Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> said after the hearing. `` I do n't care about anything else.''

 <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> `` celebreighted'' the birth of a royal baby at 8:18 p.m. on the eighth day of the eighth month of 1988, tourists `` migreighted'' to the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> town of Eighty Eight, and even mathematicians `` apprecieighted'' the chubby numeral. Buckingham Palace announced Monday that the Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, wife of Prince <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, gave birth to a 6 lb. 12 oz. daughter, their first child, who is fifth in line to the British throne. Mother and child are well, the palace said. A Palace statement said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and second son of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, was with his wife, the former <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, when she was `` safely delivered of a daughter at 8:18 p.m. -LRB- 19:18 GMT -RRB- today.'' In <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kelli-Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> came into the world at 8:08 a.m. EDT Monday weighing 8 pounds, 8 -LCB- ounces. Her mother's doctor, making his eighth delivery in his 2-week-old private practice, has eight children `` Everybody thought they were joking with all the eights coming up,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON>, head nurse in the delivery unit at <ORGANIZATION> Hackensack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The magic of 8-8-88 was n't lost on the Chinese, whose word for eight, `` baat,'' rhymes with `` faat,'' the Cantonese word for prosperity. They threw lavish parties. Merchants in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> used the date to promote everything from <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Fried Chicken to real estate, while <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> gamblers tested their luck in a special lottery with a sweetened jackpot. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> gamblers bought more than 10,520 state Lottery tickets with the 8888 combination, and officials said <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s state lottery sold out its 8888 tickets when sales hit a predetermined limit: $ 8 million. <ORGANIZATION> Tascosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, offered 88-day personal certificates of deposit at 8 -LRB- percent interest -LRB- with a minimum deposit of $ 8,888 -RRB-. Numerologists said Monday, 8-8-88, was especially lucky for marriage, and thousands of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> couples had registered to marry on the date. Reception halls around the country were booked solid, the daily <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported. In Eighty Eight, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, about 500 well-wishers cheered <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Accardo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhlbeier </PERSON>, who got married at 8:08 p.m. CDT. The bride carried eight white roses. Their 8 foot, 8 inch-long wedding cake was topped with an `` 88.'' `` Our marriage is magical. It's just the icing on the cake and I'm telling you it's thick icing,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Accardo </PERSON>, 34. `` The biggest part of it is the people of Eighty Eight. The town has been incredible.'' The couple had not set a date yet when they learned of the festivities planned in the small farm community of 150 residents, from a television news report in their distant state of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. `` Deb just looked at me and said, ` Would n't that be fun to go in there and get married on 8-8-88 in Eighty Eight, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>?''' recalled <PERSON> Accardo </PERSON>, 29, a salesman. In attendance at Eighty Eight was <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Russie </LOCATION>, who drove up to the Eighty Eight Market in her Oldsmobile Delta 88. Her license plate: `` ANY 88.'' As Ms. <PERSON> Russie </PERSON>, 45, explained: `` I'm an 88 freak.'' Eighty Eight's post office handled 25,000 pieces of mail for people wanting the EIGHTY-EIGHT 8-8-88 cancellation, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleet </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service's area manager. The day also began the centennial anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mathematical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> `` Eight is, from a standpoint of pure arithmetic, the second cube, the sixth Fibonacci number, and the sum of the first three digits of pi,'' wrote former <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardern </PERSON> in a news release. `` Applied to the outside world, eight takes on more glamour as the notes of an octave, the arms of an octopus, the eight-cylinder motor, stock market eighths, the figure-8 knot, the skater's figure 8, the eight-hour work day, behind the eight ball, old Spanish pieces of eight, and the eighth wonder of the world.'' At least until 9-9-99.

<TEXT>
 The housekeeper for <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> sobbed as she recounted how a doctor told her the entertainer was dying of complications from AIDS, then repeated the news in front of him. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> said she had not known the source of the pianist's months-long illness until <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s physician, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, told her. `` He said by law he had to tell me what <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> had, and he had to tell me in front of <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>,'' she testified in state court Monday. Ms. <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s housekeeper for 16 years; <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Angie </PERSON> <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>; and three others have filed suit in state court seeking to have attorney <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> removed as executor of the will and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the Performing Arts, which provides scholarships to nearly 30 colleges and universities Ms. <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> wept loudly as she told of the doctor checking a sore on her hand and ordering her to wear gloves when treating the entertainer. District Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> ordered a break while she regained her composure and the subject was dropped when testimony continued. Ms. <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> said she was informed of the cause of his fatal illness Jan. 22, 1987, the day <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> signed a new will making Strote the executor of his estate. The plaintiffs say <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> was too ill to comprehend its meaning when the 1987 will was drawn by <PERSON> Strote </PERSON>. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> has testified that <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> knew what he was doing when the new will was drawn up and signed two weeks before his death on Feb. 4, 1987. Ms. <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> in his final days could barely walk and talk. She said she had to bathe <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> and that he was unable to walk by himself or to talk with people in the month before his death. The housekeeper challenged testimony by <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> that he had talked with Liberace by phone on Jan. 21 to review the will. `` The 21st was the worst day <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> had,'' she said. On Jan. 22, <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> came to <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, home to have the will signed and witnessed. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> slipped into a coma Feb. 1 and never regained consciousness. `` Angie and I would lay on top of him to keep him from shaking so bad,'' Ms. <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> said. The hearing on a legal challenge to <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s will resumed Monday after being recessed earlier this summer to allow the court to handle other matters.

<HEAD>Hard Bargaining Ahead Now That Cease-Fire Date Set</HEAD>
<BYLINE>With PM-UN-Gulf

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The three weeks of haggling over conditions for an Iran-Iraq cease-fire are omens of hard bargaining ahead as the war foes plunge into the process of peace after eight years of fighting. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> say that while a cease-fire may halt the shooting fairly soon, efforts to keep the guns silent could stretch on for years. It took three weeks for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to win agreement on truce conditions after both sides finally agreed in principle to a cease-fire. Potential problems lie ahead at nearly every stage of the U.N.-mandated cease-fire process and in the peace talks that are supposed to follow. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution 598 calls for both countries to withdraw to internationally recognized borders, to exchange prisoners, and for a commission to decide who started the war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> do not agree on their borders. Some prisoners may not want to go home. And an inquiry into the war's causes could make both sides unhappy. Most serious of all, mutual distrust built up by eight years of war and threats will make agreements difficult. `` I think it will be a long, protracted negotiation,'' said a European diplomat in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. The war itself began along two disputed portions of a border that <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON>, Persians and their predecessors have contested almost since the dawn of civilization. The two countries remain at odds over the division of the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> waterway that separates southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as it flows into the gulf, as well as over a sliver of land on the central border. The Shatt poses little problem to a cease-fire withdrawal. `` You ca n't stand in the middle of the river,'' one diplomat noted.'' But it could be a tangled issue in peace talks. According to a 1975 treaty, which called for free navigation, the border was set in the middle of the waterway. Before that, the border was set on the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> side, giving <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> control. The 1975 treaty was a victim of the war. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> said President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s need to demonstrate victory in the war could make <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> stubborn on the border question. Iraqis have insisted that any truce immediately open the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON>, their main outlet to the gulf, which was closed soon after <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded in force on Sept. 22, 1980. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> says the war's first land battles took place on Sept. 4 and 7, 1980, when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> shelled Iraqi cities from the <LOCATION> Zayn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al-Qaws </LOCATION> area which <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claimed under the 1975 treaty. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> responded by occupying it on Sept. 7. This area will be a point of dispute in peace talks. Diplomats said snags also lurk in the exchange of prisoners. According to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> held about 50,000 Iraqis, while <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had about 13,000 Iranian captives before recent Iraqi attacks. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claims attacks in the past month netted it 12,000 more Iranian prisoners. Diplomats say Iraqis fear <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> may have killed some Iraqi prisoners _ a discovery that could endanger peace talks. A <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat cited reports of clashes in Iranian camps involving Iraqi prisoners who had come to support <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. Some Iranians held in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have expressed public support of <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON>. Both have reason to fear a return home. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> measure calls for a commission to probe responsibility for the war, a move taken to answer Iranian demands that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> be branded the aggressor. But the composition and tasks given such a group could trigger fierce argument _ especially if the committee's decisions affect reparations. The Western diplomat said the committee could ask who was `` responsible for provoking, initiating and continuing the war.'' He noted that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> could argue that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s threats and shelling provoked the war and that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> continued the conflict for years after <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> called for a halt. A narrower definition might favor <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which dates the war to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s invasion.

 Fireworks and gunfire pierced the sky in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital early today and people danced in the streets as the government declared victory in its eight-year war against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Fireworks cascaded over the <LOCATION> Tigris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> that cuts through the city and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition exploded against the sky after the post-midnight announcement on Iraqi television. State-controlled TV and radio called on Iraqis to `` celebrate the great victory achieved by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'' on `` the greatest day of all'' and announced a three-day period of celebration. The celebrations followed an announcement Monday by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> that a cease-fire would begin Aug. 20, followed by direct talks between <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Men danced in the streets of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> during the pre-dawn celebrations and horn-honking cars loaded with jubilant Iraqis waving palm and laurel branches drove wildly though the city. `` The war is over. Victory for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>,'' said a man at the entrance to the Al-Rashid Hotel as he looked at a sky exploding with gunfire. `` The war is over. Praise be to God,'' said a woman beside him. Tracer bullets, flares and machine-gun fire streamed into the sky for hours after the announcement while bangs, booms and thuds from anti-aircraft guns, rifles and pistols echoed though the city. Teen-agers in T-shirts fired off repeated rounds from automatic rifles while stranded in a median of a street in the posh <LOCATION> Mansour </LOCATION> district by a gridlock of noisy traffic at about 4:30 a.m. Jubilant soldiers blocked one of the city's main streets to pound on cars and shake hands with passers-by. `` Here, take this,'' giddy security men told a reporter in front of the Al-Rashid Hotel as they thrust a loaded <PERSON> Kalashnikov </PERSON> rifle toward him. But instead of handing it to him, the guards turned and fired the gun into the sky. They laughed with men guarding a government building across the street, one of whom unleashed rounds from a machine gun barely pointed in the air. One car in the hotel's parking lot showed a fresh bullet hole in its hood. Children scampered about the parking lot and through the city streets, collecting empty rifle cartridges that clattered from the guns. Many Iraqis waved flags from car windows and some donned wreaths of laurels and sat atop the hoods of speeding sedans flashing victory signs at those they passed. The emotional outpouring was in sharp contrast to the reserve with which Iraqis greeted <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s July 18 announcement that it had accepted a cease-fire in principle. The war has cost the two nations an estimated one million lives, and by some estimates a total of $ 400 billion.

On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 109.06-point loser Monday, lost 82.76 points or 0.29 percent to close at 28,170.36. The index also finished lower in Saturday's half-day session. Traders said most market participants were monitoring the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's movements against the West German mark. The dollar reached 1.90 marks during Monday's trading, a level not seen since January 1987. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> intervened in the market sporadically to keep the dollar from rising too sharply against the mark on overseas markets.

 Some say it's Bigfoot. Some say it's only a bear To some, the creature described as 7 feet tall with red eyes and three-fingered hands that quickly became known as the Lizard Man is simply a hoax. Whichever explanation one believes, there's no question <LOCATION> Lizardmania </LOCATION> has seized this rural commmunity this summer. It all started when 17-year-old <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> told police he had been attacked by a creature while changing a tire in nearby Scape Ore Swamp about 2 a.m. one morning back in June. The creature, he said, was more than 7 feet tall, was black-green and grabbed the door of his car, running as fast as 35 mph as he fled. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he swerved along the road before the creature, which had jumped on his car, was thrown off. `` It was strong and it was n't an animal and it was n't no man,'' he told Sheriff <PERSON> Liston </PERSON> <PERSON> Truesdale </PERSON>. As word of the sighting spread, hundreds of outsiders came to walk through the swamp west of town. A <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> radio station offered a $ 1 million reward and reporters descended on the quiet farming community of about 3,500. Sheriff's department spokesman <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said he has no doubt there was something on the road with <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> that night. `` I believe he saw something. What it was I have no earthly idea. But it was n't no Lizard Man,'' he said. It may have been a bear, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> suggested. Or, he said, it could have been people stopping by an artesian well in the area. He said locals are known to frequent the well at all hours of the day and night. Scape Ore Swamp got its name in Revolutionary War days. It was near a British encampment and, when the Americans moved against the area, the British camp followers escaped into the swamp. What became known as Escaped Whore Swamp became shortened over time to Scape Ore, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. Since the sighting, however, the sheriff's department has received dozens of calls from townspeople when their dogs bark at night or their farm animals act strangely. `` I think most of the people think it's a prankster or a joke,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. `` You're dealing with a skunk ape, which is a colloquial name,'' said <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckjord </PERSON>, who has researched the creatures for 10 years. `` You can call it anything you want but it's a Bigfoot.'' Authorities say there have been hoaxes as Lizardmania spread. Deputies made plaster casts of large tracks purportedly made by the creature. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said wildlife biologists determined the tracks were man-made. Last week, an unidentified man reported shooting the thing along Interstate 20, and gave authorities some scales and blood that purportedly came from the creature. The blood and scales, headed for a state crime lab for analysis, apparently are from a dead fish, the sheriff said. `` It does n't take an expert to see what they are. Visitors have been pulling off Interstate 20 for the past few weeks to satisfy their curiosity about the Lizard Man. <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> of the local <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> said business has been brisk this summer, but she had no estimate of how much money <LOCATION> Lizardmania </LOCATION> has put into the local economy. If it's Lizard Man paraphernalia you're after, there are hats, T-shirts, inflatable toy dinosaurs and even wanted posters with an artist's impression of the Lizard Man. <PERSON> Truesdale </PERSON> has had enough. He said that when stories like the Lizard Man circulate, `` a lot of people try to get publicity and feel important. We have enough to do without tracking down things like this.'' Sitting on a counter in the Sheriff's Department is a can labeled as Liz-A-Rid repellent _ a can that appears to have nothing in it.

 Astronomers searching for radio signals from intelligent life beyond the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> say circumstantial evidence is growing that humankind is not alone in the universe. Reports of the discovery of new planets and of the presence of complex organic chemicals on comets are `` encouraging'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s radio search for life, said Monday. Research announced at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s 20th assembly last week showed the discovery of at least 10 planet-like objects in orbit of distant stars Other studies showed that comets and cosmic dust particles contain the complex organic compounds that are thought to have been the chemical precursors of life. `` That is the circumstantial evidence that life exists elsewhere,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. `` We know now that the materials are there. It gives us a good feeling that we are on the right track.'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> heads a project called the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, or SETI, that is planning to mount an intensified search for radio signals from civilizations that may exist on planets orbiting distant stars. Programs run by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and others have listened for intelligence-directed radio signals for more than 20 years, but only a small fraction of the vast universe and the many radio frequencies that must be monitored actually have been checked. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is operated by the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, has proposed expanding the effort with sophisticated new equipment that would listen to tens of millions of channels at the same time. The equipment would be monitored by a computer capable of identifying signals that could be sent by intelligent life. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said the new equipment would be able to look at 1,000 different stars that are thought to be similar to the Earth's sun, locations that experts believe hold the best chance for the evolution of life. There also would be `` whole sky survey'' in many radio frequencies in which every portion of the heavens would be searched systematically. Searches in the past `` have only scratched the surface,'' said <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>. The new equipment would be 10 million times more thorough than present equipment, he said, noting, `` In the first few minutes, we would be able to match all of the searches that were done before.'' But even with the new devices, the job is immense, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> SETI </ORGANIZATION> committee of the astronomical union and an astronomer at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>. `` Many people think the project should succeed in the next year or two,'' he said. `` That's probably not going to happen. The universe is so huge and the cosmic haystack so large, it will take us decades.'' But <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> added: `` The consequences of success are so great that it's worth dealing with the problems.'' The theory behind the SETI work is that because there are billions of galaxies, each with billions of stars, the odds are good that the conditions that permitted life to evolve on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> also exist elsewhere. If so, then intelligent life could have developed along the same lines as it did here on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Civilizations that are equal to or more advanced than humankind would be sending out signals, just as occurs on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The SETI project is looking for those signals. Such signals may `` leak out'' just as they do on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said. `` The strongest sign of our existence in the universe is the accumulation of our television signals,'' he said. The second most common radio signal from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> comes from military communications. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said the federal budget now under consideration by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> includes a $ 6 million appropriation for the enhanced <ORGANIZATION> SETI </ORGANIZATION> equipment. He said the total project would last 10 years and cost $ 90 million. If the funding were approved, the intensified search could begin in 1992, with all of the new equipment operating by 1994.

<HEAD>Court: Herpes Sufferers Have Legal Duty To Avoid Infecting Others</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 People suffering from genital herpes have a legal duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid transmitting the disease, the state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. A three-judge panel unanimously held that a man may have cause for action against his ex-wife for negligent and-or fraudulent transmission of genital herpes. The opinion, which identified the man and the woman only by initials, reversed part of a lower court's summary judgment in favor of the woman. Judge <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON>, writing for the panel, said the case was the first time <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> courts had considered the issue of negligent, fraudulent or intentional transmission of genital herpes or for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Genital herpes, a sexually transmitted virus infection, `` is a contagious and debilitating disease,'' the court said. `` It is extremely painful and often leads to serious physical and psychological complications. It is presently incurable, and is spreading at an alarming and dangerous rate.'' The court said a `` reasonable person should know that if he or she has a contagious, sexually transmissible disease like genital herpes, the disease is likely to be communicated through sexual contact. `` Thus, people suffering from genital herpes generally have a duty either to avoid sexual contact with uninfected persons or, at least, to warn potential sex partners that they have herpes before sexual contact occurs.'' The court rejected an argument by the woman that the recognition of a `` duty to warn'' was an undue invasion of privacy. `` On balance, we believe that society's interest in preventing the spread of a dangerous, incurable disease justified some intrusion into personal privacy,'' the court said. In the case before it, the court said, there was a factual dispute. The woman contended she told the man she had herpes two weeks after she met him, while he maintained that she did not tell him until after they were married and he had contracted herpes from her, according to court documents. The court sent the case back to trial court for resolution of that issue and of whether the woman's alleged negligence caused the man any compensable damage. It also ordered the trial court to determine whether the man can prove the necessary elements of fraud, rejecting the woman's assertion that fraud actions may arise only in business or contractual contexts The <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the lower court's finding that the man's allegations that his former wife committed battery by deliberately having sexual contact with him knowing that she had genital herpes and that she `` recklessly and intentionally'' caused him emotional distress were barred by a two-year statute of limitations. It also upheld the trial court's rejection of the man's claims for money damages based on his allegation that the woman had misrepresented facts about her `` background and upbringing'' while they were dating.

 Mathematicians gathered here to celebrate a century of advances that have benefitted fields ranging from medicine to business and have seen American scientists rise to the top of the discipline. `` When we talk about mathematics generally 100 years ago it was a thriving enterprise,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, 49, dean of physical science and mathematics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>. `` Even so whole new areas have been developed.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> was one of about 1,300 mathematicians here for a weeklong meeting that opened Monday to celebrate the centennial anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mathematical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` Geometricians who lived 100 years ago would not believe how large the field has become,'' he said. `` It now interacts with all of the sciences, with biology, with business, with medicine, with economics. I think this would surprise people.'' The computer alone has allowed mathematicians to solve problems today that only existed in theory 20 or 30 years ago, he said. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said the advances in mathematics in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been remarkable. `` Mathematics had a small number of American mathematicians _ all of them trained in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>. `` Now American mathematics is pre-eminent in the world, having the leadership in many areas of mathematics. People come from all over the world to study here. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is still important but the balance has shifted.'' Mathematics will continue to move further into medicine and biology, and new understandings in physics will allow mathematicians to develop better machines and computers, he said. The society, originally named the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mathematical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, was formed in 1888 by a small group of mathematicians. It moved its headquarters to <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> in 1951. This week's meeting is one of two the society holds each year in conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION> Mathematical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, society spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmay </PERSON> said. Speakers will address issues ranging from computer graphics to the problems of attracting women to the field. Only about 15 percent of the society's 21,000 members are female, Ms. <PERSON> Holmay </PERSON> said. Of the 18 speakers at the conference, only one is a woman. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhlenbeck </PERSON>, 46, a mathematics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, will speak Friday on `` Instantons and their Relatives.''

 <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, on trial for air piracy and murder in the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking, on Tuesday admitted he was one of the four hijackers but said it was not he who killed the American sailor. Thirty-nine Americans were held captive for 17 days and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed during the ordeal, which ended in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. In the last court session before a summer recess, the Lebanese Shiite Moslem defendant for the first time acknowledged publicly that he was one of the four gunmen who commandeered the Athens-to-Rome flight. `` If this act which I committed is against the law, then it is a result of illegal conduct on the part of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, speaking in Arabic, said through an interpreter. He made the admission while reading from a prepared statement in the heavily guarded courtroom. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> previously has denounced <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for allegedly causing problems in his native <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and has also condemned the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. While the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had said <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was one of the four, there previously had remained questions about a precise identification from photographs taken at the scene. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> told the court he took part in the hijacking in an attempt to free Shiite Moslems held in Israeli prisons. Shortly after the June 1985 hijacking ended, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> released approximately 700 Shiites. While <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> admitted to being one of the hijackers, he denied shooting <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> and throwing on an airport runway in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` The pistol was in his -LRB- alleged hijacker <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Iz-al-Din </PERSON>'s -RRB- hand,'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said. `` I did n't use it. Our orders were not to harm anyone, but I could n't convince him not to shoot.'' <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, were sitting in the courtroom as <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> spoke. `` I took part in the hijacking,'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said. The trial, which started in July, was to adjourn later Tuesday until Sept. 6, when members of the crew of the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> plane are scheduled to begin testifying. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport on Jan. 13, 1987 when customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage. He has admitted in court to trying to smuggle explosives into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, a third charge raised against him. The West German government denied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> requests to extradite <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s older brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, was convicted by a West German court in April of masterminding the kidnapping of two West Germans in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in an attempt to force the West German government to free <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> was sentenced to 13 years in prison. One West German, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, was released in September 1987, but the second, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, remains a hostage.

 Move over rock' n' roll and make room for the polka. While <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> has been named as future site for the Rock' n' Roll Hall Of Fame and Museum, enthusiasts here, including Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON>, are raising money for a polka hall of fame Why <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>? `` The base is here, the music is here,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Petkovsek </PERSON>, chairman of the committee organizing the museum. `` <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> is the polka capital of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Polka King <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankovic </PERSON>, who in 1986 became the first polka artist to win a Grammy, lives here when he's not on tour with his band. He is one of an estimated 80,000 Slovenians living in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, more than anywhere else in the world outside <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Petkovsek </PERSON>. `` Polkas have sparked up a bit,'' <PERSON> Yankovic </PERSON>, 73, said last week from his hotel in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> where he was playing polkas for the Fraternal Order of Eagles convention. `` Now disc jockeys are playing it and teenagers are starting to try it. They ca n't really dance it but they and jump around and have a good time.'' The National Cleveland-Style Polka Hall of Fame will be in the Euclid Civic Center. <PERSON> Petkovsek </PERSON> said it will document the evolution of Slovenian folk music into Cleveland-style polka. Artifacts, recordings, button box accordions and items honoring individuals and bands will be on display, he said. There is already a Polka Hall of Fame and Museum in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Yankovic </PERSON> was the first polka artist inducted there _ but the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> museum's emphasis is on the Polish polka, said <PERSON> Yankovic </PERSON>, who has been touring the country for 57 years, entertaining crowds at county fairs, conventions and polka festivals. <PERSON> Petkovsek </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>'s reputation as the polka capital and the emphasis on the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> style are why the hall is being established here. `` Slovenian is more middle-of-the-road. Polish has more brass, more of a hop,'' <PERSON> Petovsek </PERSON> said. `` Bohemian has more brass, and German is more oom pah pah _ they'll have tubas, baritones and trumpets. Slovenians will have an accordian, sax, drum, bass and perhaps a banjo and guitar.'' <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON>, a museum committee member, said he first danced the polka as a boy and later, as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> in 1967, introduced legislation designating <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> as polka capital of the world. `` From a cultural, national standpoint, the polka has brought a tremendous amount of enjoyment to millions of Americans,'' <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> once had a weekly television show `` Polka Varieties.'' <PERSON> Petkovsek </PERSON> has been host of a daily polka radio hour for 27 years. In fact, <PERSON> Petkovsek </PERSON> has built his livelihood on a business centered on the polka. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Polka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Petkovsek </PERSON> broadcasts his radio show, sells records and tapes from what he describes as the largest collection of polka music in the world. <PERSON> Petkovsek </PERSON> is partner in a travel agency that conducts polka tours around the world. <PERSON> Petkovsek </PERSON> said he has taken up to 400 members of polka bands on tours to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Band members bring their instruments and play at taverns and listen to local polka bands.

 Looking for lions and tigers and other big animals? Not in the new Central Park Zoo. The zoo, which officially opened amid much fanfare Monday, instead has a more eclectic offering: the Golfodulcean <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> poison frog, the tufted puffin, the plumbeous water redstart -LRB- that's a bird, folks -RRB-. `` It does n't seem like a zoo to me. It does n't have any elephants or any giraffes,'' complained <PERSON> Daniella </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonzo </PERSON>, 10, one of the first visitors to the $ 30 million renovation, who nevertheless said the zoo was `` nice.'' There are 450 animals from more than 100 species. Unlike the old zoo, the new zoo has no large animals because of space. `` This is a mini-zoo, to show things likely to arouse people's interest and a sense of caring,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>, general director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the zoo for the city <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> A 4-block-long line snaked through the park within an hour of the opening as the new attractions, housed in three different `` habitats,'' drew 13,701 first-day visitors. Most did n't share <PERSON> Daniella </PERSON>'s disappointment. `` These animals know how to act. They're not like people, who have to learn how to act,'' said 11-year-old <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON>, who toured the Tropic Zone habitat with classmates from her <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> day camp. Monkeys, bats, fish and frogs were featured there; the Polar Circle is home to polar bears, penguins and arctic foxes; the Temperate Territory is home to otters, red pandas, turtles and sea lions. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> cut the ribbon to officially open the new zoo before playing straight man to a frisky sea lion named <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, circling in the newly renovated sea lion tank in the middle of the park, waved to <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, waved to the visitors, caught fish tossed by the mayor and barked on request. The renovation was supposed to cost $ 28 million, but came in at about $ 30 million, partly because work took several months longer than anticipated, Parks Commissioner <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. Construction began in April 1985. The commissioner was enthusiastic over the results. `` The other zoo was like a Sing-Sing for animals,'' said <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, referring to the zoo that was shut down in the winter of 1983. `` So we've built a humane zoo, a zoo for the 1990s.'' There was one other new feature: visitors, who once toured for free, now pay $ 1; senior citizens pay 50 cents, while kids come through for a quarter. `` When I learned they were charging, I insisted the zoo has got to cost less than an ice cream cone. If you can find an ice cream cone for less, I'd like to see it,'' said <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. `` Times have changed.''

<HEAD>North Korea Demands Urgent Talks On Olympics</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> called today for urgent parliamentary talks on its demand to co-host the Olympic Games and rejected <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s proposal for preliminary negotiations. The communist <PERSON> North </PERSON> said it would agree to a meeting Aug. 17 to handle logistical arrangements for inter-parliamentary talks on the Olympics and a non-aggression pact. But it rejected a South Korean call for detailed preliminary talks on working out an agenda for full-scale negotiations. `` Time is too short to take the form of holding a preliminary contact and then the full talks under the present condition where 40 days ... are left until the opening of the Olympic Games that must be debated as an urgent agenda item,'' the letter said. The Olympic Games start Sept. 17 in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said it will boycott unless it can co-host the event. The letter from <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyong </PERSON> <PERSON> Sop </PERSON>, chairman of the north's rubberstamp <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said the body wants the first full meeting of both parliaments to be held in its capital of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> It was addressed to South Korean National Assembly speaker <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chae-sun </PERSON>. The tough North Korean letter, delivered at the border truce site of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, said just three to five delegates from each side should attend the Aug. 17 meeting rather than the 15-member delegations proposed by <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which had tentatively accepted a North Korean call last month for legislative talks on the Olympics and a non-aggression pact, wants detailed preliminary talks to set an agenda. It called for the preliminary negotiations this week. South Korean officials believe contacts with the north reduce potential threats to the Olympics and they indicate privately the hope of keeping <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> talking until after the Games. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, on the other hand, still hopes to force <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to agree to co-hosting. If it can not co-host the Games, observers say the north needs an excuse and the failure of non-aggression talks might enable it to blame the south. Most observers believe there is little chance of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> dropping its co-hosting demand and taking part in the Olympics. Such a change would represent a total turnabout after 40 years of bitter rivalry for supremacy between the two sides. The north invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean War and the two sides technically remain at war since no peace treaty was signed when an armistice halted fighting in 1953.

 Four young adults whose bodies were found huddled in a tiny dental storage room died apparently from asphyxiation after the inhaled laughing gas, authorities said. The bodies were found Monday near an open, empty tank of laughing gas, authorities said. The bodies were taken to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>'s Office for autopsy, but Iron County Attorney <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said preliminary investigation showed they were asphyxiated after apparently inhaling the colorless anesthetic, nitrous oxide. `` It's just a tragic accident and our hearts go out to the families,'' he said. `` We've never had injuries or deaths due to nitrous oxide.'' But he said, `` It's common throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for people to try to gain access to that -LRB- nitrous oxide -RRB- to try to get high.'' He identified the victims as <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregerson </PERSON>, 18 and <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 19, both of <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherie </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 20, <ORGANIZATION> Fillmore </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Probert </PERSON>, 20, Scipio. The 6-by-6-foot storage room was adjacent to <PERSON> Gregerson </PERSON>'s father's dental clinic <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and Police Chief <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said there was no sign of forced entry, and a key was found in a jacket outside the storeroom. It appeared they let themselves into the storage area late Sunday or early Monday and turned on the gas, which was in a large tank, similar to a welding tank, the officials said. There is no suspicion of suicide or foul play, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. The bodies were found by an employee who had gone to the storeroom to get a cannister of gas and described `` a tangle of bodies _ a gruesome scene,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. Authorities described the victims as clean-cut youths with no history of illegal activity or drug use.

<HEAD>Safety Officials Call For More Controller Training for O'Hare
International</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The crowded skies above <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and basic errors by its air traffic controllers have prompted federal aviation officials to scrutinize operations at the world's second-busiest airport. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on Monday called for a `` back-to-basics'' training program for traffic controllers at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> to counter an unusually high number of controller errors. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials say they also plan a broad review of operations at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>. After a special investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> recommended that controllers at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> be provided with new and better equipment and that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> find ways to increase controller staffing, reduce peak traffic loads, improve training and develop better quality assurance. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment directly on the recommendations, but said it plans its own review of <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> by a team of agency and industry experts, with a report to be submitted to <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> by Sept. 20. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, the review will go beyond air traffic control questions and will include an examination of the airport's overall operation. More than 50 organizations have been invited to participate in the review, including representatives from the airlines, pilots union, various aviation organizations and the city of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. A spokesman for airline pilots said safety concerns are n't unique to O'Hare `` The thing to focus on is that we have overcrowded skies and an insufficient number of controllers,'' said Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Damron </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` We recognize the problems,'' he said. `` We are supportive and optimistic about our collective ability to produce some suggestions.'' <PERSON> Damron </PERSON> blamed the troubles on the firing of striking air traffic controllers by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in August 1981. Some have been hired back, but not enough to keep up with the growing demand, <PERSON> Damron </PERSON> said. `` There have not been enough applicants, and they have not been able to produce enough controllers,'' <PERSON> Damron </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> handles an average of nearly 2,200 takeoffs and landings a day. Its 796,939 arrivals and departures last year, were second only to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. Last year <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> handled more than 56 million passengers, more than any other airport. But the airport has been the subject of numerous investigations by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> and congressional committees because of safety concerns. The latest <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigation was prompted by reports in June that controllers had committed 19 operational errors where aircraft had been allowed to fly dangerously close to one another, seven more than during all of 1987. After examining these incidents, <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators concluded that in many cases controllers failed to follow procedures and in a majority of the cases the errors involved a `` breakdown in basic -LRB- air traffic control -RRB- skills.'' The safety board said that in many cases the controllers' performance was affected by `` excessive workload, lack of attentiveness, forgetting, perceptual problems, fatigue, and excessive time on position without a break. The board said it was `` concerned that these controllers, working at one of the nation's busiest terminal radar facilities failed to act in accordance with basic controller standards and principles,'' and it questioned the effectiveness of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s overall quality control program The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> also said it was concerned about excessive overtime among controllers, shortages of controllers and the need for better equipment.

 As dawn breaks over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on Aug. 20, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s guns are to fall silent after eight years of war that have claimed the lives of up to 1 million people. Peace talks to end the deadly conflict will begin five days later in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. `` The restoration of peace will bring to the peoples of both countries victories far greater than those of war,'' Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Monday in announcing the truce. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meets today to authorize a 350-man unarmed <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force to monitor a cease-fire and troop withdrawals. `` I have been assured by the two parties to the conflict that they will observe this cease-fire in the context of the full implementation of Resolution 598,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s comprehensive peace plan, said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> `` The governments of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the Republic of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have also agreed to the deployment of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> observers as of the time and date of the cease-fire.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> did not announce dates for a troop withdrawal, prisoner exchange or other elements of the year-old <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace plan. The populations and economies of both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been exhausted by a war fought with modern weapons but with tactics that harked back to the most brutal campaigns of World War I: set-piece battles, trench warfare, mustard gas attacks, human wave assaults. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> told reporters on Monday: `` I wish to declare my government is prepared to accept the demand of the secretary-general and that of the entire world community to refrain from any military action on land, sea and air, starting today. ... `` Let me express my sincere hope that today's historic announcement will be the first step in the implementation of all provisions of Resolution 598, and the achievement of a just, comprehensive and honorable setttlement, returning peace and stability to all the region,'' he added. Ambassador <PERSON> Ismat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> told reporters: `` Now we begin the arduous but happy march that begins from here. I am sure it will not be a smooth road, but it will be much more pleasant than fighting and bloodshed.'' The cease-fire agreement was announced after a weekend of feverish negotiations in which <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> gave up its demand for face-to-face talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as a precondition to a truce. On July 18, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> abandoned its longstanding insistence that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> be branded the aggressor in the war as a first step toward peace, ending a year-long stalemate in peace efforts. One provision of Resolution 598 will establish an impartial commission to judge responsibility for the conflict, and <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> made it clear <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hopes this commission will blame <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for starting it. War broke out in September 1980 when <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after a series of clashes along the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway that separates them. The waterway is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only outlet to the gulf. On Monday, the secretary-general's office released a report saying the gulf peacekeeping mission may include a small naval patrol for the waterway, the first time the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has planned to commission a fleet. The report estimates the cost of the unarmed peacekeeping force at $ 74 million for the first six months, of which $ 47 million would be start-up costs. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> will assess its 159 members for the cost of the mission. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said Monday that about 25 nations would send officers to the force to be called the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. He declined to name the countries, but said it was unlikely that any of the permanent <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ would send troops. If the cease-fire plan takes hold, as diplomats and observers believe it will, it will be the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' second major peacekeeping success this year. In April, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s pro-Moscow regime signed a peace accord in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for the withdrawal of more than 100,000 Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes today blasted a guerrilla base and a PLO-run radio station, knocking it off the air. Police said at least three guerrillas were killed and 12 wounded in the attack near this southern port city. A police spokesman said six <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes fired 26 missiles in 14 attacks on a building housing offices and studios of the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> radio and an adjacent guerrilla base southeast of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. He said the two-hour Israeli attack, the longest in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year, began at 10 a.m. The three people killed were at the guerrilla base, police said. The police spokesman said most of the missiles hit the ground floor of the radio station building. An Israeli army spokesman in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> confirmed the raid. He said the station was used to broadcast instructions to Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories, where unrest has claimed more than 200 lives since December. `` The base in southeast <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was a radio station used for propaganda and incitement broadcasts, and to pass orders for executing terror attacks,'' he said. He spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with military regulations. All the planes returned safely, he said. The police spokesman, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said: `` The ground floor, which is the only visible part of the VOP building, was totally demolished by the first four missiles. `` It seems that the Israelis are trying also to demolish the three underground floors of the radio.'' Palls of thick black smoke billowed from the building and the nearby base, about a half mile south of the Mieh Mieh Palestinian refugee camp on <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s southeastern edge. Rescuers in a dozen ambulances and fire engines arrived at the stricken building a half hour after the raid ended and dug into VOP's three underground floors to rescue anyone who might be trapped, the spokesman said. The radio station, according to the police spokesman, was founded early in June and beamed special programs to the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement blared by loudspeaker vans, called for urgent blood donations at <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> and the nearby camp of <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Hilweh </PERSON>. The police spokesman said the raiding jets fired scarlet balloons to deflect heat-seeking, shoulder-held missiles fired by Palestinian guerrillas. Witnesses in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said guerrilla defenders firing their anti-aircraft guns missed the raiding jets. One witness, speaking on condition of anonymity, said motorists deserted their vehicles and sought refuge in orange and banana groves as the Israeli warplanes roared overhead. He said air raid sirens wailed in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, the provincial capital of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, during the attack. Shopkeepers lowered their shutters and several people deserted businesses and took cover in basements and bomb shelters. It was the 12th Israeli air attack in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. By police count, 62 people were killed and 81 wounded in the previous 11 raids.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s commander-in-chief said today his country would not initiate any more military actions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, but told soldiers to maintain their vigil against possible enemy attacks. `` The armed forces should not, from today, be the initiators of any kind of military and armed moves,'' said <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, acting commander of the Iranian forces and also speaker of Parliament. `` But just like always, -LRB- <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> -RRB- will be ready to give an appropriate response to the mischiefs of the enemy,'' he said in a statement broadcast on official <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio. Only at 7 a.m. today, by way of <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, did most Iranians learn a cease-fire is to take effect Aug. 20 in their 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The announcement Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> came too late for the main morning newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Jomhuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islami </ORGANIZATION>. Iranians greeted the announcement with a sense of relief mixed with skepticism that it will mean lasting peace. `` I heard it on the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- much earlier,'' said a middle-aged man who declined to give his name. `` Sure, it's good, but I hope that there will not be years of discussions like the talks that have been going on for so many years about peace between the Arabs and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' `` Hopefully it means peace,'' said a hotel employee in the Laleh Hotel. `` But celebrating? After so many martyrs?'' A man who introduced himself as a telephone operator was smiling broadly. `` I just learned it 10 minutes ago. Sure, I will celebrate tonight with my family. I will have a bottle of <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>. You know, there is no drinking in our country.'' A driver who said he formerly held a well-paid job in construction told a visitor: `` My son, <PERSON> Romin </PERSON>, has sent a message that he is coming home in four weeks now that the fighting ends. He has been in the army for two years and eight months. Luckily he has not been wounded. The place where is he is now is pretty quiet.'' A 25-year-old named <PERSON> Fahrad </PERSON> said he was excused from military service because of injuries he suffered in a car accident while studying petrochemical engineering in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` Many of my generation are dead,'' he said. `` In a way I was lucky to have been in that accident.'' A Western diplomat said expectations had been running high among <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> residents, but `` they will be disappointed, normalization will take much time.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity. European diplomatic sources, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said both sides seemed interested in restoring relations but that process would take some time. `` There is a lot of emotional debris to be cleared away on both sides,'' one analyst said. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter requested permission to visit front-line troops preparing for the truce, but a <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guidance </ORGANIZATION> official said it was not possible. A request to visit <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s war cemetery brought the same answer. An editorial in the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> pointed to the issues that have to be solved in direct talks that begin in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Aug. 25 before the neighbors can have comprehensive peace. `` What follows is really going to be crucial,'' the editorial said. `` All negotiations now intended to be held under the aegis of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general will undoubtedly have to take the Algiers Accord as a reference point.'' The Algiers Accord, which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> signed in 1975, was an attempt to settle outstanding border disputes, especially over access to the Shatt-al-Arab waterway. The delta of the <LOCATION> Tigris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Euphrates </LOCATION> rivers is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only outlet to the sea and the accords set the border in the middle of the waterway. `` It has to be remembered that the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> leader -LRB- President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> -RRB- did not have the slightest hesitation in tearing up this agreement quite openly in a fit of pique at the inception of the war,'' the newspaper said.

 Israeli troops shot and killed a 14-year-old Palestinian and wounded eight other Arabs today, hospital officials said. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes destroyed a radio station in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that reportedly broadcast orders to the occupied territories. The latest fatality brought the Palestinian death toll to 238 in the uprising in the occupied territories, now in its ninth month. Four Israelis have been killed. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 12th air raid on southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year, a military spokesman said the air force destroyed a PLO-run radio station and an ammunition storehouse in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Police in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said three guerrillas were killed and 12 wounded in the attack near <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. Commercial life was at a standstill today in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and at least eight cities in the occupied lands in observance of a general strike called by <ORGANIZATION> pro-Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> underground leaders. Arab merchants shuttered their shops and many of the 110,000 who work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> stayed home from their jobs, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports and witnesses said. Buses and taxis also stayed off roads, most of which were deserted or blocked by protesters burning tires, witnesses said. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Swei </PERSON>, 14, was fatally shot in the head during a clash today between soldiers and dozens of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths who hurled stones, according to a spokesman at a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> clinic in <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>. The army said it was investigating the death, adding that a curfew was imposed on the town after disturbances. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> also was placed under curfew. Hospital officials reported eight people wounded today. But a military spokesman said the army could immediately confirm only two Arabs shot in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> city of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> today, an 18-year-old man from the Mugazi refugee camp was rushed to <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after soldiers shot him in the chest during a clash, hospital officials said. Two other Arab protesters were shot in the legs during the same incident, the officials added, speaking on condition of anonymity. Soldiers also wounded three other Gazans in the town of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> during a protest that began when <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> activists tried to prevent other Palestinians from heading to jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. The army confirmed two of the wounded. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, soldiers fired at protesters who hurled stones at the city hall building and blocked a road with burning tires, wounding two, according to officials at a local clinic.

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today praised the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as `` growing'' but accused Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of avoiding public stances on major foreign policy issues. `` I do n't think <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s positions are clear on much of anything,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declared. He asserted that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has moved closer to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' own positions on crucial issues such as relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cited the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, the regional conflict in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the strategic arms reduction talks. `` It's an administration that's growing. ... Frankly they're coming a lot closer to where I am'' on such issues, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` The INF -LRB- intermediate nuclear forces -RRB- treaty and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s approach to the summit demonstrate a willingness on his part to explore closer relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> It's to his credit. `` Here's an administration that five years ago was talking ` evil empire,''' he said, referring to the words <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> once used to describe the Soviets, `` and now the president is walking arm-in-arm with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in Red Square.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made the comments to reporters aboard his chartered campaign jet as he flew to <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, where he was participating in the final day of meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> The Democratic presidential nominee is in his third term as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> offered some praise for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on foreign-policy issues, he leveled a new blast at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the vice president and expected <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee on those same issues. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s foreign-policy positions were unclear on all but `` this endless fiasco in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supports aid to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes it. `` I do n't know. Do you know where he stands?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said to reporters. `` I do n't think anybody knows where he is on these things. ... The only thing he's done is to express some doubt on U.S.-Soviet relations.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> attended to his governor's office duties Monday. But at a Statehouse news conference, he faced repeated questioning about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s renewed assault in which the vice president described him as a `` stealth candidate'' who has ignored issues and concealed his liberalism. `` I think the way I'm going to win the presidency is not by responding every day to what some speechwriter has put in front of Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` It's going to be by defining myself, my party, my values, this country, its future, and the kind of society I think all Americans want.'' But pressed by reporters, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> offered a response anyway. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has some of the highest negatives ever recorded in the history of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politics, and I think one of the reasons for it is people have seen his campaign as an essentially negative campaign,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has enjoyed big leads in recent polls, said voters were looking for positive expressions of what a candidate planned to do as president _ and suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not been doing that. `` I do n't think they're interested in a daily diet of this kind of thing, and it's one of the reasons, at least at this point, the Republican campaign seems to be in trouble,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> planned to campaign in Northeastern states Thursday and Friday before spending the weekend vacationing on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> with his wife <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>. The campaign was preparing for next week's Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is expected to be the object of criticism and derision. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides were suggesting they expected to see much of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' double-digit lead over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in recent polls evaporate in the week of Republican exposure. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, following the lead of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, planned to head out on a four-day campaign swing nex week beginning Wednesday, the third day of the GOP convention. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> broke with the tradition of not campaigning during the rival's convention week by venturing out during the Democratic convention three weeks ago. At his news conference, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> recalled an 8-year-old blast that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leveled at <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the 1980 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket, as the governor's response to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s charge he lacked foreign policy experience. `` He made the same comment about the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate for the presidency in 1980, and he's now trying to succeed him. So what can I say?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. His aides distributed copies of a 1980 newspaper story that quoted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as saying of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>: `` We can not take a chance on another president who has absolutely no experience in foreign affairs.''

<DATELINE>HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dozens of firefighters doused a magnesium fire early today at a sprawling industrial plant near the site of a deadly rocket fuel blast that shook this community three months ago, authorities said. The fire at the <ORGANIZATION> Titanium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was reported at 1:50 a.m. and was under control by 2:40 a.m. No injuries were reported in the fire that caused an estimated $ 15,000 damage, dispatcher <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobosh </PERSON> said. The fire erupted after two ingots of magnesium apparently were placed too close together, but the exact cause of the blaze is still under investigation, she said. `` The magnesium melted and got into water'' in a drain, Ms. <PERSON> Dobosh </PERSON> said. The reaction of the magnesium and the water may have caused some small explosions, she added. A <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> fire official said 12 units were sent to the plant. Also sent was a team that specializes in fires involving hazardous materials. The plant covers several blocks, dates to World War II and is located about 20 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> residents are still cleaning up from the May 4 explosion at the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant, just three miles from the Titanium facility. That explosion, which killed two people and injured 326, occurred when a series of fires touched off an explosion of ammonium perchlorate, a critical oxidizer used in rocket fuel for the space shuttle and various military rockets.

 The Princess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, newborn daughter of the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> and Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, is fifth in line the British throne now occupied by her grandmother, <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. The baby girl born Monday night is far enough away from the ancient seat not to have to train seriously for it as her Uncle <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, the first in line, did. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' 6-year-old son, Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, is destined to be king after his father and will no doubt have to study for the role more diligently than younger brother <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, almost 4, the third in line. The baby's father, 28-year-old Prince <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and second son of the queen, is fourth in line as long as <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, have no other children to push <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> further down the list. The baby princess is officially Her Royal Highness Princess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Her place in the line will change if her parents have a son, who would be placed ahead of her, or if the Prince and Princess of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> have a daughter or another son. The new York baby pushes Prince <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, 24, the queen's third son, back to sixth place, and 37-year-old <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> _ her only daughter and second-eldest child, back to seventh place. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s children _ <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Zara </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, 7 _ are eighth and ninth in line. They are not a prince and princess, nor are they designated royal highnesses, because <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s husband, equestrian champion <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, has no royal title. The queen's 57-year-old sister, Princess <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, the Countess of <PERSON> Snowdon </PERSON>, is 10th in line followed by her children, <PERSON> Viscount </PERSON> <PERSON> Linley </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong-Jones </PERSON>, 24, in 11th and 12th place. The order of succession then shifts to the queen's cousins: the Duke of <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION> and his three children, the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> and two of his three children, and the two children of his brother <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>, who lost his own place by marrying a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. The Duke of Kent's eldest son also lost his place in the line of succession because he married a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. The Kent brothers' sister, Princess <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> and her two children are next.

 Twenty Soviet officials today inspected a cruise missile base and repair shop under the superpower treaty to remove medium-range nuclear missiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The Soviet inspectors, led by <PERSON> Viacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyebedev </PERSON>, arrived Monday at Abelag airport in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on a Tupolev-134 of the Soviet airline <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>. They were welcomed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and Belgian officials. The Soviets, divided into two teams, were driven this morning to <LOCATION> Florennes </LOCATION> air base, 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, and a repair factory in <LOCATION> Gosselies </LOCATION>, 10 miles north of the base. In <LOCATION> Florennes </LOCATION>, which houses the 485th <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has deployed 20 cruise missiles since 1985, including four spares. According to the latest figures, there were 55 missiles at the Gosselies repair plant, which belongs to <ORGANIZATION> Sabca </ORGANIZATION>, a Belgian aviation company servicing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruise missiles. Under the treaty, the inspectors may spend up to 24 hours at each site, with a possible eight-hour extension. The inspections are part of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Soviet Uhion are to destroy within three years all medium-range nuclear missiles with ranges of between 300 and 3,400 miles. The treaty gives each party on-site inspection rights for 13 years. Under a 1979 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> agreement, 572 cruise and <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> 2 missiles were to be deployed in five European nations.

<HEAD>300 Evacuated After Train Derailment Spills Flammable Chemical</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDDLETON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three hundred residents of this tiny, northeast <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> community were forced to spend the night away from home after chemical tankers fractured in a train derailment spilled an industrial solvent. About 20 people were treated briefly at a hospital Monday after they inhaled the slightly toxic fumes from the spilled solvent, a highly flammable liquid called xylene that is used in aviation fuel and as a solvent for resins, enamels and lacquers. An estimated 61 cars in a 95-car <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> freight train derailed at about 1:30 p.m. Monday near the track's intersection with <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> 72 in <LOCATION> Middleton </LOCATION>, a rural community four miles southeast of <LOCATION> Elberton </LOCATION>. Seven of the derailed cars were carrying hazardous materials and at least three of those cars were leaking, said <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>. The damaged tankers were spilling their contents into a cow pasture, said <LOCATION> Elbert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dooley </PERSON>. Emergency personnel evacuated about 300 residents within about two miles of the derailment, <PERSON> Dooley </PERSON> said. The evacuees were brought to <ORGANIZATION> Elberton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> where volunteers helped them find shelter at local motels or at the homes of family and friends in the area. Authorities built a dike, using booms supplied by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, to keep the pool of liquid xylene from flowing into nearby <LOCATION> Beaver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, which forms the headwaters for <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Russell </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Justus </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the state Environmental Protection Division. The liquid probably would be allowed to soak into the dirt and the contaminated soil would be dug up and removed to a hazardous waste landfill, she said. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said railroad workers expected to clear the tracks by Thursday. The 95-car train, which was headed to <LOCATION> Hamlet </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, also carried coal, pulpboard, lumber, soybean meal and a number of truck trailers, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. He said the train was going about 35 mph when it derailed. There was no immediate indication of what caused the derailment.

<HEAD>Sudan's Prime Minister Declares State of Emergency</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s prime minister has declared a nationwide state of emergency to cope with the country's worst floods in 42 years, which have left more than 1 million Sudanese homeless, <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> newspapers said today. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, was almost completely paralyzed for the third straight day from power and water supply cutoffs caused by floods that followed torrential rains last week, the leading state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION> said. Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> announced on state television Monday night that a six-month state of emergency was in effect to help his government cope with the destruction. In <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, Ambassador Omer el-Sheikh of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that millions of people have been stranded by floods in eastern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. El-Sheikh said more than 10,000 houses were destroyed in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> alone _ double the official figure given in the capital Sunday _ and that he expected the number to increase. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> who spoke on condition of anonymity said he had received reports of 11 dead, some 100 injured and 1.5 million people left homeless. He said he had no independent confirmation of the figures. Al-Ahram and <ORGANIZATION> Al-Gomhouria </ORGANIZATION>, another Egyptian state-owned newspaper, said at least 11 people died, some electrocuted by smashed power cables falling into flood waters. On Sunday, the Sudanese government declared <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> and three other cities disaster areas and appealed for international help. The newspapers said that in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, the public transport system collapsed, universities and schools were shut and some of the capital's nearly 4 million inhabitants faced starvation after bakeries closed and food supplies dwindled. The state-of-emergency decree enables the government to ban strikes and demonstrations, make arrests without warrants, tap private telephones and impose press censorship. A one-year state of emergency decreed in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> last year ended only two weeks ago. It had been declared to deal with the effects of the war against rebels in the south and the deteriorating economy. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> responded to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s appeal for help, sending 10 C-130 military transport planes carrying tents, medical supplies and food. In <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> said today it had approved $ 712,000 in emergency aid. The money will provide tents, blankets and other emergency equipment and will allow doctors to fly to the African nation. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Saleh </PERSON> said that in addition to <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, the eastern cities of <LOCATION> Kassala </LOCATION> and Showak and the northern city of el-Damer were declared disaster areas because of floods triggered by continuous, heavy rainfall Thursday and Friday. He said entire villages had been isolated by flood waters. Finance Minister <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nour </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Dayem </PERSON> said in reports carried Monday by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> that about 1 million people were homeless after their houses were washed away. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, along with most of central <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, had been suffering from several years of drought. A 5-year-old civil war in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> has contributed to widespread famine since 1985, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to trek north to <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> and southeast into neighboring <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>.

But it's good.'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, the 28-year-old second son of the monarch and a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant, flew to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Sunday from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> where he is on sea duty on HMS <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>. News of the birth was announced to the ship's crew and the prince's fellow officers immediately toasted to the health of the baby and parents. The Buckingham Palace statement announcing the birth said the Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was `` safely delivered of a daughter at 8:18 p.m..'' The statement said the delivery was `` a normal birth'' and ` there were no complications. Neither the palace nor the doctors would say whether the birth had been induced, as newspapers had speculated. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> was present at his daughter's birth, the palace said. British press reports said the prince, an accomplished amateur photographer, took the first photos of his daughter. There was much speculation over the baby's name, with <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> as favorites. Early in his wife's pregnancy <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> had been quoted as saying the baby would be called <PERSON> Annabel </PERSON>. Whatever the choice, the baby will be Her Royal Highness, Princess -LRB- name -RRB- of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. She is fifth in line to the throne behind <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>'s older brother, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' two children Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> himself. The queen's two other grandchildren, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zara </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, are the children of her only daughter, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> The baby's birth at 18 minutes past 8 on the eighth day of the eighth month of the century's 88th year is being taken by well-wishers as a sign of great good fortune. The day is considered highly auspicious by Cantonese-speaking Chinese, whose word for eight is similar to that for prosperity. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> headline said: `` At 8:18 on 8.8.88 _ A Safe and Lucky Royal Birth.'' The tabloid <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> said: `` <ORGANIZATION> Fergie </ORGANIZATION>'s first baby has been blessed with the century's luckiest birthday.'' A message of congratulation from Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Denis </PERSON>, who are visiting <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, read: `` It is wonderful news and your happiness will be shared by the whole nation.''

 Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> joined fellow governors today as they were told the next president `` will have a limited amount of time to make the tough choices'' needed to deal with the federal budget deficit. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took his seat at a corner of the square table at which the nation's governors sat for the closing session of the 80th annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The governors' first order of business at the session was to hear from former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., co-chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a panel established to recommend ways to deal with the deficit `` That commission is not going to come up with any magic answers, but it can provide important political cover for the next president,'' said <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> congressman said the next president would face difficult choices on such questions as the level of defense spending, whether to cut programs that include automatic benefit increases, and whether to ask for a tax increase. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said nothing during that opening discussion. Governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> for 10 years, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> attended the meeting the day after the governors warmly applauded President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> when he told them that during his two terms in the White House the states had gained far more flexibility and power to deal with domestic problems. No longer just one of 50 state governors seated around the conference table, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also was meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governors for a closed session on strategy for his campaign against Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` He will ask the governors to speak out on his behalf,'' said campaign spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, who added that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> believes his record as a governor is one of his greatest strengths. Before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke to the governors Monday, he stopped at a local plant and told workers that `` some people'' were campaigning on the idea that `` it's time for a change, take a chance on us.'' But `` you ca n't unplug our pro-growth economic policies and expect things to stay the same,'' he said. In that speech and in his later talk to the governors, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cited the number of jobs created during his tenure, as well as lower unemployment in general and reduced taxes. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s theme was picked up by Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, who said Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would carry the nation's largest state despite current polls there giving <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a double-digit lead over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` Why would the people want to risk a change in going to a total unknown person, an unknown administration?'' asked <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>. As governor of a state with 47 electoral votes, nearly one-fifth of the 270 needed for election, <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> was mentioned often as a potential running mate for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But the governor took himself out of contention for that spot in a letter last week to the vice president. Turning to another likely <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign theme, <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said that after the Democratic convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last month, `` the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has been Jacksonized,'' a reference to the prominent role given to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> predicted <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would `` want to continue to be in the limelight'' and that `` Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is going to have his hands full with Mr. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> between now and Election Day.'' But while <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> described <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as unknown, fellow Republican Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suffers from the same problem. `` One thing our polls show is that people do n't know what he -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- has done before becoming vice president and people are confused about his views on the issues,'' said <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, a supporter of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and keynote speaker at the Republican convention next week. <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said that in the course of the long presidential campaign, people have gotten to know <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and polls show they are inclined to support him. By contrast, said <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, the polls show that `` people know <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and they do n't like him.''

 <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> admitted in court today to being one of four men who hijacked a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in 1985, but denied killing a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver during the ordeal. `` I took part in the hijacking,'' the Lebanese Shiite Moslem said, reading from a statement in the heavily guarded courtroom. `` If this act which I committed is against the law, then it is a result of illegal conduct on the part of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, speaking in Arabic, said through an interpreter. Thirty-nine Americans were held captive for 17 days after <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 847 was hijacked on an Athens-to-Rome flight. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was beaten and fatally shot and his body thrown onto a <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport runway. Under West German law, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> still can be convicted of murder even if he did not actually pull the trigger. He faces a maximum of life in prison. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, on trial for air piracy and murder, said he hijacked a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft `` because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the greatest ally and supporter of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' Clean-shave and waring an open-neck cream-colored shirt, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> read calmly and clearly from the statement. He said the goal of the June 1985 hijacking was to gain freedom for Shiite imprisoned in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` The decision to hijack the plane came after everything else failed,'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said in 45-minute presentation. `` There was no other way to free the prisoners other than the means chosen.'' Shortly after the June 1985 hijacking ended, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> released approximately 700 Lebanese. In reflecting on the hijacking, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> told the court: `` I am not ready to do something like that again.'' `` As I took part in the action, that happened out of the belief that there was no other way to get the release of those imprisoned. Now, I'm of the opinion that that's not the case.'' The trial, which started in July, was adjourned until Sept. 6, when members of the crew of the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> plane were to begin testifying. Until today, the only testimony that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was involved in the hijacking came from two witnesses who testified that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s older brother <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> had told them as much. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> told the court that one of the three alleged hijackers still at large, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Izz-al-Din </PERSON>, was in charge of the hijacking and had shot <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. `` The pistol was in his -LRB- <PERSON> Izz-al-Din </PERSON>'s -RRB- hand,'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said. `` I did n't use it. Our orders were not to harm anyone, but I could n't convince him not to shoot. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, were in the courtroom as <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> spoke. When <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> finished, Chief Judge <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> said the testimony `` was surprising for everybody. It marks a certain turn in the trial. `` It was an intelligent presentation of your point of view,'' he added, saying the court would have to reconsider the future course of the trial. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport on Jan. 13, 1987 when customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sought his extradition, but <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> turned down the request after two West German businessmen were abducted in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was sentenced to 13 years in prison after he was convicted by a West German court in April of masterminding the kidnappings in an attempt to force <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to free <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. One of the abducted men, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, was released in September 1987. The other, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, remains a hostage and is believed held by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> group in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A third <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> brother, <PERSON> Abdul-Hadi </PERSON>, is <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s security chief in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has denied being a member of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>.

 An exterminating company has been convicted of violating federal pesticide law for failing to monitor the fumigation of a house in which two people later died. Atlanta-based Orkin Exterminating Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> could be fined up to $ 500,000 At a brief hearing Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> convicted the company of one count of violating federal pesticide law but agreed to throw out four other charges alleging <PERSON> Orkin </PERSON> had improperly fumigated the <LOCATION> Galax </LOCATION> home of <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Freida </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> on Sept. 25, 1986. <PERSON> Orkin </PERSON> had faced fines totaling $ 1.7 million on all five counts. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said the maximum fine in the single conviction, $ 100,000, could be raised to $ 500,000 if it can be proved that the pesticide killed the couple. <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> set sentencing for Sept. 6 and ordered a pre-sentencing report. `` Basically what I'm interested in in a pre-sentencing report is any previous conviction for this type of behavior and the financial condition of the company,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Orkin </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> declined comment on the ruling. An indictment returned by a federal grand jury this spring alleged the company did not follow labeled instructions on the pesticide, <PERSON> Vikane </PERSON>, and allowed the <ORGANIZATION> Watsons </ORGANIZATION> to move back into their home before it had been thoroughly ventilated. <PERSON> Orkin </PERSON> also was accused of removing warning signs before the home was aired out and failing to test the home with appropriate monitoring equipment to make sure it was safe. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, 73, died three days after the fumigation. Mrs. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, 65, died four days after her husband. <PERSON> Orkin </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the marketer of <LOCATION> Vikane </LOCATION>, also are named in a $ 2.5 million federal lawsuit filed by <ORGANIZATION> Signet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of Mrs. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>'s estate.

 Gunmen fired on security forces before dawn today as gangs of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters took to the streets to mark 17 years since authorities began jailing guerrilla suspects without trial. Eight police officers were injured, none seriously, and 42 people were arrested, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, the province's police force. Four injured civilians were still hospitalized today but the exact number treated and released was not known. Police said the gangs launched about 80 attacks on security forces Monday night and early today in a constant barrage of bullets, bombs, rocks and other missiles. Protesters hijacked cars, erected barricades across streets and lighted dozens of bonfires. Security forces fired plastic bullets to break up the rioters, including a crowd of several hundred throwing gasoline bombs at police outside a bus station. On at least one occasion, police opened fire with live ammunition. The violence was concentrated in the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> western and northern areas of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Outside <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, there was less trouble although clashes were reported in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Down </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Downpatrick </LOCATION>, County Down, a primary school was damaged by fire and there were three arrests. In <LOCATION> Antrim </LOCATION>, two houses were set on fire, police siad. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> abandoned internment in December 1975 after worldwide criticism, but <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters continue each year to mark the anniversary of its introduction on Aug. 9, 1971. In separate attacks, shots were reported fired at a police patrol and at a police station and a grenade was thrown at an army barracks. A stolen car crashed through a security checkpoint, knocking down a policeman, who was not seriously hurt. Security forces fired at the fleeing car, which escaped. The violence followed the deaths of two Roman Catholics in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> Monday in a suspected revenge slaying by Protestants for a new spate of <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> attacks. In the attack, gunmen firing from a car fatally shot a youth and a beer deliveryman, both Catholics. The gunmen escaped and abandoned their car in a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> district about two miles away, police said. Police sources and moderate Catholic leaders blamed the attack on <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremists taking revenge for a series of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombings and shootings in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that left six dead and 37 injured last week. Police sources said the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, an outlawed guerrilla group, is believed responsible. It was the first Protestant extremist attack in more than a month. The killings took place as police chiefs and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> political leaders met to try to devise new security measures against the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> wants to unite the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the Republic of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

The commission last year ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to divest itself of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> after the rejection of that railroad's merger with the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> Fe Southern reached agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, but when permission for the sale was sought from the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION>, another railroad company, <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, objected and sought to buy <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> as well. But the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> in a series of votes today turned its back on the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> proposal and approved the sale to <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Industries </LOCATION> instead. At a news conference, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Anschutz </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, applauded the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> decision and said the combined railroads `` will operate under the banner of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said that senior officers of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> will be announced before the purchase is completed and that managers will be drawn from the ranks of both railroads. The <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> also has extensive real estate holdings in the West, but <PERSON> Anschutz </PERSON> said, `` We will be in the railroad business, first and foremost.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> operates up and down the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and along the southern tier of the country with tracks stretching from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, through central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and as far east as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> troops today fired on thousands of demonstrators calling for the overthrow of President <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, and a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat said he had reports of more than 100 people killed. State-run radio said at least 36 people died. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said witnesses reported seeing demonstrators carrying bodies of dead protesters over their heads as they marched through the streets of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> capital. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said reports from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> put casualties in today's demonstrations in `` the hundreds,'' but said it would take time for information to be sorted out. A Rangoon-based Western diplomat said he had `` fairly credible'' reports of more than 100 people killed as students, monks and others confronted soldiers who had been moved into the city since martial law was declared last week. State-owned <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> radio said authorities clamped an 8 p.m.-to-4 a.m. curfew on the capital and banned gatherings of more than five people. The radio said five people were killed and 55 wounded in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, while 31 people were killed and 37 wounded in the central town of Sagaing. The Sagaing protest broke out as 5,000 demonstrators tried to seize the police station. The radio said 1,451 `` looters and disturbance makers'' had been arrested. It was unclear whether the figure included more than 800 people the radio previously said had been arrested. The broadcast listed a total of 26 areas, not including <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, where demonstrations were held today. It also said schools throughout the country, including elementary schools, were closed indefinitely. All universities were ordered shut following riots last June. Some foreign offices, including the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, closed their doors today and Burmese consulates in some <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> cities stopped issuing entry visas to tourists. `` It was a game of cat and mouse. The army was chasing,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a 27-year-old Australian architect who arrived in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> today. He said he saw up to 600 soldiers, some armed with machine guns, at <LOCATION> Shwedagon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pagoda </LOCATION>, a site of anti-government protests. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said parts of the city were cordoned off with barricades and roadblocks were manned by soldiers. On a drive from <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, he said he saw six armored cars and up to 20 trucks loaded with troops heading for the capital. `` They appeared nervous but ready for some sort of trouble,'' he said. The demonstrations are by far the largest show of anti-government sentiment since democracy was toppled in the Southeast Asian nation in 1962. `` This is a tragedy. Our reports say the crowds have been very conciliatory -LRB- towards the security forces -RRB-,'' one diplomat said today. `` Things are going from bad to worse.'' Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> reported mass demonstrations Monday in areas ranging from <LOCATION> Moulmein </LOCATION> on the southern coast to <LOCATION> Taunggyi </LOCATION> in the mountainous area of the <LOCATION> Shan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It said security forces killed four people and wounded 12 in <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION> and the same number of casualties were inflicted in <LOCATION> Mergui </LOCATION> on the southern coast during `` violent incidents.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> that 30,000 people took part in Monday's protests in the capital, while more than 10,000 students, monks and others demonstrated in <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s second-largest city. Students have been at the forefront of protest against <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, whom they blame for ordering the suppression of demonstrations in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> last March and June in which more than 100 people were killed by unofficial count. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> was named president and chairman of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s ruling party last month and soon after ordered the arrests of the most outspoken critic of the authoritarian government, former Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, other dissidents and <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent Sein Win. Rangoon-based diplomats link government price increases, hoarding of food and other economic hardships to the general tension in the country. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s economy suffered greatly under the isolationist policies of Ne Win. Inflation is soaring and the country has a foreign debt of $ 4 billion. Over the past year, conditions have worsened and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> _ with an annual per capita income of less than $ 200. Since the fall, there have been anti-government demonstrations in virtually every city and town. In <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, Burmese consular officials said they had been ordered by <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> to indefinitely stop issuing tourist visas to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, but the consulate in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> said it was continuing to process them. Officials said businessmen could still apply for special visas. In recent weeks, Burmese embassies around the world have tried to screen out journalists applying under tourist visas. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> has been unable to enter the country.

 Fierce thunderstorms ranged from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> today after much of the central <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was belted by storms bringing large hail, drenching rains and winds that blew out windows and leveled trees and power poles. Lightning killed a teen-age girl and critically injured her friend at a <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, park. In the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, Tropical Storm <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> moved across <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> today, prompting the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to alert 16 coastal parishes for possibly heavy rains. Strong storms ripped through northeast <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> early today but the intensity of many storms began to fade in early morning. In southern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, high winds toppled trees across Highway 24 at <LOCATION> Muskego </LOCATION>, while in <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>, winds gusted to 60 mph. Streets in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> were flooded by the torrential rain, and at least one funnel cloud was sighted. Strong thunderstorm winds also scattered trees at <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Rockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, as well as in <LOCATION> Plainview </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walcott </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Power poles fell in high winds at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, strong winds brought down trees and blew out windows. <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, was blasted by winds up to 60 mph and hail the size of golf balls. The storms also brought a deluge of rain. More than 2 inches fell at <LOCATION> Kearney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, rain forced officials to cut short the <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION>' first night baseball game at <LOCATION> Wrigley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>. `` This is typical,'' said one disgruntled fan. `` It does n't rain all summer long, and then on the first night game ever, it has to rain.'' In <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION>, witnesses told police that a lightning bolt hit a tree at <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, then apparently traveled through the ground and struck the two girls Monday afternoon. <PERSON> Karla </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedding </PERSON>, 17, died immediately, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloyd </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner. Her friend, who was not identified, was listed in critical condition at <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complex </ORGANIZATION>. As <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season's second named storm, moved over <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, forecasters said its movement raised hopes that it might dissipate. Earlier, several coastal communities were evacuated as the storm, which has already forced thousands of oil workers from their offshore rigs, intensified off the <LOCATION> Louisiana-Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. At 8 a.m. EDT today, the <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON>'s center was just northwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> at latitude 30.2 north and longitude 90.3 west. Highest sustained winds were 50 mph. Warnings were in effect from <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Thunderstorms spawned by <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> poured heavy rain along the Gulf Coast from southeast <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> to Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, received more than 3 inches of rain early Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> across southern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>; numerous thunderstorms from <LOCATION> northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to western <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> from Tropical Storm Beryl; scattered showers and thunderstorms through lower <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, southeast <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, much of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> to northern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>; and fair weather throughout the rest of the nation.

 Medical debris like that plaguing beaches in the Northeast has been found on a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> beach and police were investigating reports that more material washed up today, police said. No beaches were closed. Used syringes and vials such as those used in blood tests were found in a plastic trash bag that washed up Monday night at <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said today. `` It has blood vials, testing vials, and some used syringes in it and other medical debris,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. `` I did not detect any blood. I opened the top of the sack up to see what was in it. There were no blood samples or anything ... I did n't see any needles. It appeared the needles had been cut off.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said he was awaiting direction from <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON>, emergency management coordinator for <LOCATION> Carteret </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, about possibly closing beaches. `` We do n't foresee any problems at this time ...,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> fired a return salvo at <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today, grabbing a central attack theme from the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee-to-be and charging `` I do n't think <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s positions are clear on much of anything.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has hit <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in recent days with a barrage of criticism, saying the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor is inexperienced in foreign policy and waffles on the issues. On Monday, he set the tone for next week's <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, taking advantage of a rare appearance for a nominee at platform hearings to light into <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He's the stealth candidate,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` While he ca n't decide about the stealth bomber, he favors instead stealth policies _ they can be neither seen nor heard. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supports research and development for the supersecret bomber but has not vowed to support deployment. As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got off one of his better lines, Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> said he would n't stoop to using `` some cutesy-poo'' name to attack <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> during his nominating speech for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I'm not going to demean the office by trying to think up some cute name that I can call him that somebody might laugh at,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said, referring to wisecracking speeches that Texans <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> made at the Democratic National Convention. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stayed away from direct attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today, painting himself instead as tough on crime and touting his opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are those, like the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, whose first concerns are the protection of the criminals' rights and the potential abuse of power by police,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a police group in <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` My first concerns are the protection of law-abiding citizens and the abuse of our system of constitutional protections by thugs who can go and hire smart lawyers and find the right judges to set them free.'' And the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice president said liberals in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> just duck the tough issue of drug enforcement: `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is full of rhetorical heroes on the issue of drugs, but when it comes to law enforcement a lot of the liberals there go AWOL.'' The Democratic nominee lashed back at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as he flew from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> to join the final session of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s foreign-policy positions were unclear, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, with the sole exception of `` this endless fiasco in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supports aid to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes it. `` I do n't know. Do you know where he stands?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said to reporters. `` I do n't think anybody knows where he is on these things. ... The only thing he's done is to express some doubt on U.S.-Soviet relations ... I do n't think <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s positions are clear on much of anything.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did offer some praise for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies, saying relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have improved, for example. `` It's an administration that's growing,'' he commented. On Monday in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, the governors heard a farewell speech from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, with the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> incumbent staying away from the campaign specifics but boasting of the accomplishments of his administration. `` Our states, like our citizens, have known the blessings of the longest peacetime economic expansion on record,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. In the convention city, politics took a back seat to the weather as tropical storm <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> pounded away on the region. The storm stalled off the coast, with strong winds blowing heavy rain through the city. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was weary of the constant pounding from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whom he leads by double-digit margins in the national polls on the fall election, and he said the public is getting tired of it as well. `` I do n't think they're interested in a daily diet of this kind of thing and it's one of the reasons, at least at this point, the Republican campaign seems to be in trouble,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. At first, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said he would not respond to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I think the way I'm going to win the presidency is not by responding every day to what some speechwriter has put in front of Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Then he responded. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has some of the highest negatives ever recorded in the history of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politics, and I think one of the reasons for it is people have seen his campaign as an essentially negative campaign,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, touring the Superdome where the party will bestow its nomination next week, denied that he was engaging in negative campaigning. `` No, no ... very positive,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said as he visited with teen-agers painting signs for the convention. `` We've got to get these differences in focus.'' He also called for a party platform that will stand up well in comparison with what he called the Democrats' `` document of deceit.'' With the convention his, and no serious arguments within the party, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was certain to get the platform he wants _ although the party subcommittees took testimony into the night from more than 200 witnesses. `` We need to make this campaign a plan for the future, a statement of solutions, not an exercise in evasion,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The one mystery about the four days of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> meeting _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice of a vice president _ stayed a mystery. `` Still working on it'' was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comment Monday, sticking with his promise to announce his decision on the last day of the convention. Members of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Contests tried to resolve challenges to as many as 39 of the 48 delegates from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the primary there, but supporters of television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> made a run at taking over the party machinery. Regardless who is seated, the delegates must vote for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

 The bright lights of night baseball illuminated <LOCATION> Wrigley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> for the first time in 74 years, but the historic game was cut short when the rain came and lightning bolts lit up the sky. `` I feel like we saw the beginning of history being made, but we did n't get to see the end,'' lawyer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurasch </PERSON> said Monday night, as the heavy rain halted the game in the bottom of the fourth inning with the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> leading the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phillies </ORGANIZATION>, 3-1. Two hours after 91-year-old Cubs fan <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> declared `` Let there be light!'' and threw the switch that turned on the towering <LOCATION> Wrigley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> lights, the clouds took over. The game at the last major-league ballpark with day-only games was postponed two hours and 10 minutes later, delaying <PERSON> Wrigley </PERSON>'s first official night game until tonight's contest between the <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> Monday's rain was seen as symptomatic of the <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION>' seemingly endless disappointments to its fans, like when the team blew potential championships in 1984 and 1969. `` It's kind of like the fates are against them,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, a neighborhood activist who led the fight against night games. Some made out anyway. Scalpers got up to $ 250 for tickets. Rooftops with views of the field were rented out for as much as $ 1,000. Fans with tickets to Monday night's game can exchange them for any game for which tickets are available or get refunds, the <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> said. They wo n't be able to attend tonight's game; it's sold out. The day began with boundless optimism for <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> fans. Throngs filled the <LOCATION> Wrigleyville </LOCATION> neighborhood early, many chugging beer. An army of vendors hawked commemorative T-shirts for up to $ 15 a piece. `` I think it's beautiful,'' said <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, 62 as she sat on the stoop across from <LOCATION> Wrigley </LOCATION>'s main entrance in 99-degree heat. `` It seems like everybody's in a good mood despite the heat. I have n't seen a crabby face yet.'' Some residents prepared for the worst, organizing patrols against drunkeness and vandalism. `` I never minded the day games because it's daylight and you can see what the people are doing, but I mind the night games,'' said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Habbe </PERSON>, 56, who has lived less than a block from <LOCATION> Wrigley </LOCATION>'s main entrance for 20 years As daylight faded, parts of the neighborhood began resembling a party. On the roof of one apartment building across from <LOCATION> Wrigley </LOCATION>'s right-field wall, 45 peopled attended a catered party where the women wore cocktail dresses and the men black ties, tuxedo tops and Hawaiian shorts About 250 people, many clutching beer cans, gathered behind the left-field wall to watch the lights being turned on and try to catch a home run ball. In their midst, stood <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who drove 300 miles to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lovington </LOCATION> in central Illinois, even though he was not among the sellout crowd of 39,000 with tickets. `` We just could n't pass this up. This is just incredible. It's a great big party. You can just go from bar to bar to bar,'' he said. Police were prepared with a force of 172 officers, including mounted patrols and canine units, but few problems materialized. Authorities reported at least five arrests, including three for ticket scalping and two vendor violations. And city officials said more than 60 illegally parked cars were towed by the start of the game. Ivy-covered Wrigley, built in 1914, held on to its daytime-only baseball tradition decades longer than any other ballpark in the nation. The last team to light up _ the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> _ did it 40 years ago. <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted in February to lift the ban on lights despite fierce opposition from a neighborhood group known as <ORGANIZATION> CUBS </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baseball </ORGANIZATION> in the Sunshine. The team has eight night games for this season and 18 for every year until 2002. But <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, vice-president of the opposing neighborhood group, vowed Monday night that <LOCATION> Wrigleyville </LOCATION>'s residents wo n't give up their fight, begun in 1981 when the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> bought the <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> and announced its plans to erect lights. If the group fails to halt night games or at least win a curfew and other restrictions, <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> predicted, the <LOCATION> Wrigleyville </LOCATION> precinct would vote the area dry of alcohol in the spring 1989 municipal election. `` I think it would be a real disservice, especially watching this carnival atmosphere, to give up the fight,'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said.

They were charged in the deaths of Inkster Sgt. <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, 41, and Officers <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubiel </PERSON>, 36, and <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, 24, whose bullet-riddled bodies lay in a motel room while the family held police at bay for 10 hours. The sons also were found guilty of numerous felony firearms and felonious assault charges. Attorneys for the defendants said they would appeal the verdicts. `` I think their minds were made up early, and they were n't able to resist the pressure to convict,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON>, Easter's attorney `` I'm disappointed. It's a very tough case to resist the pressure to do a lot of things the jury did.'' The defendants displayed no emotions publicly while families and friends of the slain officers hugged two <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> assistant prosecutors after the verdict was announced. `` The survivors and loved ones reminded me every day of what was at stake,'' Assistant Prosecutor <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. The officers had been trying to serve a bad check warrant on Easter and one of the Lemons when they were shot. Easter had claimed both that the officers shot each other while exchanging gunfire with the family inside the room, and that they were shot during exchanges between the family and other officers outside. Autopsy reports said the officers were killed within minutes of entering the motel room. <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dubiel </PERSON> were shot 29 times each, one report said. Police and the Easter family exchanged gunfire during the night of July 9, 1987, before the family gave up early the next day. They have been jailed since. Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> scheduled sentencing for Sept. 13. The murder convictions carry mandatory life prison terms.

<HEAD>Three More Child Victims Won't Testify, Jeopardizing 27
Molestation Counts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The refusal of three alleged victims to testify in a pre-school molestation trial could force the dismissal of 27 charges, prosecutors said. The defense, however, said the case is collapsing of its own weakness. The children balked because they are traumatized and want to avoid reviving painful memories, Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Lael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said outside court following Monday's surprise announcement. Two boys have continuing nightmares and a girl has lost her memory of all events up to a year ago _ a sign of `` massive depression,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. The children were students at the McMartin Pre-School. `` While we have a responsibility to present all of the evidence, we also have a responsiblity not to increase trauma to kids,'' she said. Without the testimony, trying to prove the allegations against <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 30, and his mother, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 61, would be an `` extraordinarily difficult thing to do,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. The Buckeys are charged with 99 molestions and one joint count of conspiracy, although 82 of the counts name only <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>. Thirty charges rest on the testimony of the three children who refused to testify and on another child who declined to take the stand last month. Thus, nearly a third of the remaining charges could be dropped if the judge finds insufficient evidence to support them. The elimination of some witnesses also means the yearlong trial _ part of a 5-year-old case _ could end within a month, Ms. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. Following the disclosure, the prosecution called to the witness stand <PERSON> Kee </PERSON> <PERSON> MacFarlane </PERSON>, the social worker whose interviews with hundreds of children in the case became a point of controversy in pretrial hearings. Ms. <PERSON> MacFarlane </PERSON> testified that she used games and picture coloring to get some children talking about their alleged molestations. The jury watched a videotape in which she asked a girl to identify body parts on naked dolls. The defense has contended that the children were coached or coerced by the social worker or their parents into alleging molestation. Nine children have testified so far in the case that once focused on 41 youngsters, but <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said outside court he had suspected that some child witnesses would be dropped. `` The remaining three witnesses had more contradicitions and unbelievable accounts -LRB- in their testimony -RRB-,'' he said. `` They were a liablity -LRB- to the prosecution. -RRB- `` I think the prosecution case is falling of its own weight.''

<HEAD>Judge: Activists Will Remain In Jail Until They Tell Names</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Sixty-three anti-abortion activists using the names `` Baby Jane Doe'' and `` Baby <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>'' _ which they say represent aborted fetuses _ will remain jailed until they tell police their real names, a judge ruled. Police arrested 69 people over the weekend at three abortion clinics in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, bringing to 276 the number of protesters arrested since the series of demonstrations began during the Democratic National Convention July 19. About 170 members of the group sponsoring the protest, Operation Rescue, remained in jail Monday. Most are charged with criminal trespass and giving a false name to police. Operation Rescue, based in <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, has been using a cable television show hosted by former Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to recruit volunteers to continue filling the jails. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambros </PERSON> ruled the legal cases against 63 of them would not proceed until they gave their real names. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Fierer </PERSON>, an attorney for the activists, said he will abide by the order `` unless or until some other court says it is not correct.'' <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail officials said they have spent $ 66,450 to hold and feed those arrested; officials say the influx of protesters is straining already crowded county facilities. Operation Rescue says lengthy daily coverage on the `` 700 Club,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s show on the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, is helping attract many abortion opponents to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` He is our one link to Christians all across the country that we have not had from the secular media,'' said the group's spokesman, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> The 700 Club, a 90-minute daily show with about a half-hour news segment, has been carrying regular reports on the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> anti-abortion protests and flashing the <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION> telephone number on the screen during the reports. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> declined to be interviewed, but a spokeswoman said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> contends he is only providing news coverage of an important event.

<HEAD>Big Hurricane Year Could Help Ease Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Weather experts usually are loathe to say anything nice about hurricanes, but some are conceding that the big tropical storms could be something of a blessing during the drought. People who do n't live along the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> or Gulf coasts should be hoping for hurricanes, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> LeComte </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Weekly Weather and Crop Bulletin, said Tuesday. `` I think most people are really hoping for a benign hurricane to move up the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and really drench the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> LeComte </PERSON> said. `` What we really want is to get a hurricane and take the wind away and take the tornadoes away but keep the rain,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Heim </PERSON>, a meteorologist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Climatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` Of course, if you get one you get the other,'' <PERSON> Heim </PERSON> observed, so if `` we get a nice hurricane to put a dent in the drought, it can also put a dent in a lot of people's property.'' Hurricanes, nature's most powerful storms, develop over warm tropical waters and churn into huge systems with winds as high as 100 mph or more. The hurricane season starts in June but the storms tend to be most active in August and September. Right now, tropical storm <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> is churning up the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Historically, hurricanes have caused massive destruction of oceanfront properties. Weather experts say the winds and surge of sea water driven ahead of the storms are especially dangerous. Once they move inland, hurricanes lose the energy derived from the ocean and break up, sometimes producing powerful thunderstorms. These storms often provide 5 inches of rain or more, and can produce a major share of the annual moisture in some areas. In 1980, for example, a serious drought in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was broken by the combined rains of Hurricane <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> and Tropical Storm <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON>. Yet hurricanes also can produce so much moisture that droughts may be replaced by equally disastrous flooding. <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was swamped by 43 inches of rain in 24 hours on July 24-25, 1979. In two days in September 1950, <LOCATION> Yankeetown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, was drenched by 38.7 inches of rain. This year, as drought continues to plague much of the nation, the onset of hurricane season _ even if the storms prove as benign as <PERSON> LeComte </PERSON> would hope _ probably would benefit only limited areas. `` What we would like it to do, to help end the drought, is -LRB- for a storm -RRB- to move into the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> areas and sit here for two or three days. That's the optimum thing,'' <PERSON> Heim </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> <PERSON> Graumann </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION> data center said hurricanes usually move along the Gulf and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coasts and bring more relief to the Southeast than most other areas. Others tend to move northward as far as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. It is possible for remnants of <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> hurricanes to move as far inland as <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, `` but that is very, very unlikely,'' <PERSON> Heim </PERSON> said. It is very rare for rain clouds from a hurricane to become caught up in a cold front and move even farther inland. `` About the only way to quickly make up the 10 to 15 inches of rain needed in the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> would be a hurricane, but I do n't think anybody wants it all at once,'' <PERSON> LeComte </PERSON> said.

 Officials in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> today called off plans to evacuate resorts threatened by wildfires and tourism in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s Yellowstone National Park returned to normal, but crews continued battling blazes in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The largest forest fire of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s season moved away from two lakeside resorts in the <ORGANIZATION> Deschutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> when winds shifted, <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The fire, which had consumed 12,500 acres by this morning, threatened the resorts Monday; campers and tourists were warned they might be evacuated. `` The evacuation plans we developed are on the back burner at this point and hopefully they'll stay there,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Solberg </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. In <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, the only injury reported was that of a pilot whose helicopter crashed while carrying water to the blaze Monday. The pilot was listed in fair condition today at a hospital, where he was treated for a head injury, cuts and bruises. In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, tourists continued pouring into <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, despite forest fires covering some 180,000 acres of the park. Lower temperatures and higher humidy have curbed many fires. `` The fires have slowed down,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON> said. `` I know we did not see significant increase in acreage, and all the fires continue to be contained within the park boundaries.'' The cooler weather is allowing some smoke to lift, giving tourists a closer look at some burned acreage where many trees survived the flames. The south entrance to the park was open all weekend; <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON> said visitation was back up to normal levels for this time of year. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, crews were trying to contain a 630-acre fire south of Glacier National Park while contending with grizzly bears. Nearly 150 firefighters and smokejumpers, backed by aerial bombers and helicopters, battled the stubborn, wind-blown fire Monday. Extra precautions were ordered with food and sleeping arrangements because grizzlies roam the area, said fire boss <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunnell </PERSON>. Firefighters also were told to work in groups, he said. In eastern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, fire crews tried to get under control a 1,500-acre blaze in remote, roadless terrain. `` We had another pretty good day. Fire crews kept the fire within control lines, but there are a couple of areas that pose a threat,'' <ORGANIZATION> Targhee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornell </PERSON> said.

She may return home to <PERSON> Hallie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, in as little as two weeks, Ms. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> said. `` I got the second transplant on my birthday and I considered that a gift of life,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Smolenski </PERSON>, the mother of three children, said at a hospital news conference. `` I have a whole lot more energy now and I'm looking forward to laying around and then being a mother again,'' she said. For now, Mrs. <PERSON> Smolenski </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, will stay six blocks from the hospital in a $ 752-a-month apartment donated by the landlord, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The woman, who suffered from a rare liver disorder called primary biliary cirrhosis, entered the hospital for evaluation May 17 and was discharged June 7, when she moved into a camper atop her parents' pickup truck as she awaited a call for a liver transplant. Her parents, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ersley </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON>, parked the truck in an empty parking lot at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>. The family bathed with wet sponges and used public toilets in hospitals and dormitories for more than five days. Police officers donated sandwiches and doughnuts. Finally, campus policeman <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> called university officials for help when the couple said their daughter was growing weaker in hot temperatures. University officials put up the family for one night in a dormitory before the landlords offered the furnished apartment. Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffield </PERSON> said officials had been unaware the family lacked adequate housing. Her husband, whose 31st birthday is Wednesday, said Tuesday that his wife's release was his present. `` You know how the license plates in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> say, ` You've got a friend in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>? I believe that now,'' <PERSON> Smolenski </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said today there is no room for further compromise with Republicans on aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels because `` we've gone as far as we can go.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, told reporters he is prepared to press the Democratic aid plan to a vote and continues to hope it will attract bipartisan `` That would send the right message to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` we're still hopeful of getting a Contra aid package passed.'' Speaking to reporters not long after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressional leaders, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` the Democrats say they want a bill.'' But he also said that `` the language -LRB- of the Democratic bill -RRB- is convoluted.'' Many Republican senators made it clear Monday they do not trust the Democrats to carry out their side of the bargain. They said the Democratic aid plan is seriously flawed because it does not contain adequate resources to deliver stockpiled arms to the Contras and has no guarantee <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> will permit a vote. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> was asked if there was any flexibility on his side of the issue. `` No, I do n't think so,'' he replied. `` It seems to me we've gone as far as we can go. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration is concerned about what he called weaknesses in the Democratic bill with respect to systems for getting assistance delivered to the Contras. He said that bill `` would have the impact of saying you can deliver it in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> but not in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and that's where the troops are.'' Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, speaking Monday after a private meeting in which many Republicans objected to the Democratic plan, said he would take `` one more shot'' at negotiating a bipartisan aid package. However, he added: `` I would n't want to be overly optimistic.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> also said he hoped some compromise could be reached. But Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., said compromise was unlikely because the debate over aid to the rebels fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government `` has been so long, so emotional, so partisan, that there's little trust Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., who took part in talks with Republicans on the compromise legislation last week, said flatly, `` The negotiations are over I do n't think there is any more room. We've gone as far as we can go.'' The Democratic plan would permit $ 27.1 million in immediate non-lethal `` humanitarian'' aid to the Contras. It also would give President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> an opportunity to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this fall to release some $ 16.3 million in previously purchased arms, ammunition and other military supplies now stored in warehouses in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But it also requires <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to certify that such military aid to the Contras is justified because <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has disrupted the `` peace and stability'' of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by taking two of these three actions: an unprovoked military attack on the Contras, `` blatant violations'' of the regional peace plan, and continued `` unacceptable levels of military assistance by Soviet-bloc countries, including <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' Some senators said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s rulers could prevent the military aid from being released `` just by being good boys for 30 days.'' Conservative Republicans called on <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> to force a vote on a Republican alternative which would make $ 20 million in new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid available to the Contras as well as releasing previously approved military aid from warehouses and providing the `` humanitarian'' assistance. Sources inside the meeting said Army Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser, reported that he has `` serious reservations'' about the plan. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said that if progress is not made in reconstructing a bipartisan alliance on the issue, he will offer the Democratic aid plan as an amendment to the pending <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> appropriations bill. Contra leaders contacted the White House and several <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators Monday morning to declare their unanimous opposition to that plan. <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Contra resistance forces, said <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> leaders see the Democratic plan as resulting from `` internal politics in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> which basically seek to reward -LRB- Nicaraguan President -RRB- <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> for not complying with the commitments of the peace process.''

The senior steward of the <ORGANIZATION> Jockey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Lord </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fairhaven </LOCATION>, said he feared that guidelines on drinking and security needed to be strengthened. Other sports, such as soccer and boxing, have banned alcohol from arenas because of crowd misbehavior.

<HEAD>Defense Contractors Consistently Overcharge, Audit Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Defense contractors routinely overcharge the government for spare parts, and the excess charges, although small in percentage terms, total hundreds of millions of dollars, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. An unusually broad internal defense audit found that nearly half the contracts reviewed involved some measure of overcharging. In the majority of instances, the auditors reported, the overcharges resulted from a military contractor's failure to abide by a law requiring the company to share with the government the latest information it has on labor and material costs. If the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> receives `` defective'' cost or pricing data in the course of contract negotiations, the result is almost always an overcharge to the government, the auditors noted. The audit, conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general, took more than three years to complete and was one of the largest ever conducted. It reviewed 774 contracts and subcontracts, worth a combined $ 54.3 billion, held by 95 companies. `` Of the 774 pricing actions audited, 365 -LRB- 47.2 percent -RRB- were overpriced by $ 788.9 million,'' the report said. `` The principal reasons for the overpricing were that contractors did not comply with Public Law 87-653, Truth in Negotiations Act, on 359 of the 774 pricing actions.'' That level of overpricing amounts to slightly less than 1.5 percent of the total value of the contracts audited, the report added. By law, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> can recover money overcharged by contractors, with interest. The government's claims can be contested by the contractors and the disputes resolved through negotiations. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, in releasing the inspector general's audit, announced the department had so far recovered $ 283 million of the $ 788.9 million identified in the report. `` The department will continue to examine all costs questioned and to recommend appropriate actions,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> added. The inspector general concluded his report by suggesting the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> hire more auditors, recommending the department `` provide the funding and resources needed to substantially increase the level of defective price audit coverage provided.'' The report noted that, historically, the audit agency can recover about $ 19 in excess costs for every dollar spent on price audits. That recommendation, however, already has become the subject of an internal dispute. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Helm </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s comptroller, said in comments attached to the report he did not view the findings as adequate justification for the expense of hiring more auditors. He and other <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said the current force of auditors could improve the situation by helping defense contractors devise more accurate methods of estimating costs for use during negotiations.

 <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, the socialist president-elect, takes office Wednesday committed to ending <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s pro-U.S. stand, reversing free-market economic policies and negotiating easier terms on the foreign debt. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, who leads the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, has said one of his first acts will be to renew diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said privately <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> feels it can work with the new president. `` <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> may prove to be a problem for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> at times, but he is no threat to democracy in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>,'' the official said. Relations with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> were broken in October 1985 by conservative President <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s closest ally in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, whom <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> replaces. <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> could not run for re-election becaue the constitution does not permit a president to serve consecutive terms. `` Re-establishment of relations is a sign that our government is independent and sovereign,'' said <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>, official spokesman of the new administration. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, a 53-year-old law professor who is a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, is a longtime political foe of <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> and lost a presidential election runoff to him in 1984. He won the presidency in May, defeating populist candidate <PERSON> Abdala </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucaram </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, a South American nation of 10 million people about the size of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, returned to democracy in 1979 after nine years of civilian and military dictatorships. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is among seven Latin American presidents, most of them leftists, scheduled to attend. They include <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, whose trips abroad are not frequent, and his visit is viewed in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> as an unusual show of support for the new president. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will represent the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, the socialist president of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, also plans to attend. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> has said he will seek close relations with the organization of nations that profess non-alignment and end <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>'s free-market policies, which he blames for the worst recession since <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> began exporting oil in the early 1970s. The economy shrank by 3.5 percent in 1987 and the annual inflation rate is nearly 60 percent, the highest in five years. Fewer than half the nation's workers have full-time jobs. <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> took pride in meeting obligations on the $ 9.2 billion foreign debt for most of his four-year term, but no payments have been made since January and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> is more than $ 1 billion in arrears. Officials of the <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> government blame the nation's economic problems on the decline of world oil prices and earthquakes that crippled the oil industry for six months in 1987 The new president has said he will impose exchange controls, restrict imports to save dollar reserves and control prices of basic consumer goods to fight inflation. He also has announced plans for a more restrictive policy toward foreign investment and, unless creditors agree to easier terms, a moratorium on foreign debt payments. `` I do n't believe the debt is payable under the present circumstances,'' he said recently. Personal animosity between <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> and <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> has created problems in the transition of power. <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> said he would not attend the inauguration or follow the Ecuadorean custom of personally turning over the presidential sash to his successor. `` Since the wellfare of the Ecuadorean people depends on the next government, may God help them and insure their success,'' he said Friday. `` But knowing them as I do, I have my doubts.'' Besides the personal feud, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s political turmoil in recent years has included two unsuccessful military rebellions against <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>, a kidnapping of the president in which disaffected paratroopers held him for 11 hours, and an attempt by the opposition-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to impeach him. <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> has accused <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> of trying to sabotage the new government by creating economic problems before he takes office. `` We are concerned by the bankrupt state in which we are receiving <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>,'' he said, and charged the <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> administration with creating an 11 percent budget deficit `` to cause us difficulties'' with inflation. Interior Minister <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON> described the complaints as `` whining.''

<TEXT>
 Investigators today blamed the leftist guerrilla group <ORGANIZATION> Comando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bolivar </ORGANIZATION> for the bombing attack on Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. The group, which described itself as `` anti-imperialist'' in calls to news agencies claiming responsiblity for Monday's blast, also was behind at least two other bombings in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> since April 1987. On Monday, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedregal </PERSON> said both the attack on <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s motorcade and a dawn bombing at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy commissary in La Paz were the work of cocaine traffickers. The Native National Force of <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilca </PERSON>, a previously unknown group, also called reporters to say it was behind Monday's bombings, but officials discounted that claim Bolivian investigators offered no elaboration on why they gave credit to the claim of responsibility from the <ORGANIZATION> Comando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bolivar </ORGANIZATION> group. They would only say the group carried out other bombings and bank robberies. A remote-controlled bomb damaged three cars in <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s 11-vehicle motorcade Monday as he drove to La Paz from the airport The blast ruptured a tire and blew out three windows, including one next to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s wife. No injuries were reported in the roadway blast or in the bombing at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> commissary. Police said the roadway bomb, believed to be several sticks of dynamite, was set off by someone on a hill overlooking the road seconds after <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s car passed. The blast tore up pavement and threw rocks across the road. On Monday night, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> praised <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> efforts he said have put drug lords on the run. The secretary of state, whose visit intended in part to express <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for anti-drug efforts, said he was not `` intimidated by the tactic of using violence to try to scare government officials.'' After giving a talk entitled `` Winning The War Against Narcotics'' at a La Paz hotel, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> left through a back exit under extremely tight security and was driven to the airport for a flight to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. This time, the airport road was cordoned off. The 67-year-old <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has been secretary of state since 1982. He has traveled widely but has never before been attacked. In his talk to government officials and business leaders, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> praised <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s cooperation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in recent anti-drug efforts. He said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` has looked at your law and your performance with great interest, and I trust that your steady commitment will convince the members of our legislative body of your serious intentions. To sum up, the drug traffickers are in trouble in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>.'' Last month, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> passed a law that declares 90 percent of coca plantations in the country illegal and imposes stiff penalties on coca producers and traffickers. It also captured <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, who the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> called one of the world's leading cocaine traffickers. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> is serving a 15-year prison sentence. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aid topped the agenda in meetings with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, said Planning Minister <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozada </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had promised to speed up disbursements of funds <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has approved. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has allocated $ 75 million in aid to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> for fiscal 1988. Of that amount, $ 15 million is earmarked for narcotics interdiction and crop substitution efforts. But <PERSON> Bedregal </PERSON> says <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> needs at least $ 120 million a year to effectively combat the drug industry, which brings in up to $ 500 million a year, compared to $ 470 million for all legal exports combined. Aside from funding for development programs in the main coca producing region, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has an estimated 40 special forces and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> troops as well as border patrol and <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. They have trained and equipped 650 Bolivian anti-narcotics police and assisted in raiding cocaine processing pits in the <LOCATION> Chapare </LOCATION>, where 80 percent of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s cocaine is produced. Police, however, must often attack cocaine processing labs using World War II-vintage carbines while traffickers have sophisticated automatic weapons. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as the biggest consumer of drugs in the world, has a special responsibility in this battle.'' `` The pirates and warlords of the drug business have fought you at every step, with money, intimidation and violence,'' he told the gathering. `` But there can be no question that <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> has made the right choice. We salute you for that choice.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cooperation with government efforts to fight the drug trade has angered the 350,000 farmers _ from among <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s 6.7 million population _ who depend on coca leaf farming and cocaine production for a living. They say the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Bolivian governments are not doing enough to assist in the transition to other crops. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, on a 10-day, nine-country Latin American tour, flew to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. His tour began Aug. 1 in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and is scheduled to end Wednesday in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>.

 Thirteen-year-old <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammonds </PERSON> has a rare blood disease and needs a bone marrow transplant, and his family is looking for his wandering sister, who they last saw nearly 11 months ago. `` Please come home,'' <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> said Monday of his 20-year-old sister, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammonds </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> has aplastic anemia, which his doctor described as a `` one-in-a-million'' illness in which the bone marrow virtually shuts down and stops producing blood cells. <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> feels fine and appears healthy, but Dr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Tokaz </PERSON> said he has moderately low blood counts that will keep getting lower unless something is done. `` He's a good kid, champion soccer player,'' said <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammonds </PERSON> `` He's played all-star soccer. The kid makes good grades. He's on the honor society. He's the kid everybody wants. He's the kid, if you wanted a kid, you'd say, ` Hey, this one here will be fine, I think I'll take that one.' He's one of those type kids, respectful to his mother and father. And he studies. He's a good boy. <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> is a good boy.'' <PERSON> Tokaz </PERSON> said the best chance for recovery is a transplant of bone marrow from one of <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>'s two sisters, which should restore <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>'s ability to reproduce blood cells. His other sister, <PERSON> Eloise </PERSON>, 28, of Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, has returned to <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> for a possible transplant but the family also wants to find <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> soon in case no one else would be a suitable donor. <PERSON> Eloise </PERSON> and her parents planned to be tested this week to see if one of them qualifies, but the results of those tests will not be known for several days. `` What if nothing happens by then?'' <PERSON> Hammonds </PERSON> asked. `` We'll have used up all this time, and all of a sudden you've hit a zero Then what?'' But <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> faces fraudulent check charges here in <LOCATION> Travis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said her father, a corrections officer for the sheriff's office, and the family has lost touch with her. She was apparently in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, in recent weeks, and also has lived in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, since they last saw her. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said he is confident his daughter will return if she knows about her brother. `` She'd probably have to go to jail, and I think <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> knows that,'' he said. `` But if she heard that her brother was in trouble, she would come.''

 A black fraternity will make its debut this fall on the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION>'s all-white Fraternity Row despite an apparent arson fire because the school will renovate another house for the group. The university has received tentative approval to assume the obligation of renovating the vacant Phi Kappa Theta fraternity house, three houses up the block from the Phi Beta Sigma house that burned Thursday, Ole Miss Chancellor <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said Monday. `` The morning of the fire, we were in touch with them -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Phi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kappa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theta </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` We felt like with its being available ... the most immediate need was to get Phi Beta Sigma on Fraternity Row.'' Police patrols have increased since fire destroyed the house that Phi Beta Sigma members had planned to lease from another fraternity, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. The 20-member black Phi Beta Sigma had been readying the vacant 40 - to 50-year-old brick and wood house for the fall Fire officials said they discovered evidence of a fire accelerant in a closet on the second floor, where the blaze began. The evidence was turned over Monday to the state Crime Lab.

<TEXT>
 Tropical Storm <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> moved onshore across <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> today, prompting storm alerts for 16 coastal parishes and raising hopes that it would move farther inland and dissipate without causing serious damage. `` If it continues to move west or northwest, <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> should gradually weaken,'' the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. There was still a chance the storm might move back over the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and gain strength before returning to land, but forecasters said that would e unusual. The Coast Guard today rescued six people who were forced to take refuge on <LOCATION> Petit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bois </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Pascagoula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, after the storm prevented them from landing their boat on the mainland, authorities said. More <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coastal communities were evacuated as the storm, which had already forced thousands of offshore oil workers inland, drifted slowly along the <LOCATION> Louisiana-Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. No injuries or serious damage were reported. As of 11 a.m. CDT, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the center of the season's second tropical storm in the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was 50 miles west of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, near latitude 30.0 north, longitude 90.6 west. The storm's highest sustained winds were near 40 mph, mainly in squalls in coastal waters, the service said. Although widespread heavy rains were not reported at midday over <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, officials said locally heavy storms threatened areas to the east and southeast of the storm center with flooding. Almost a foot of rain fell at <LOCATION> Dauphin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for the 24-hour period ending at 7 a.m. today, the weather service said. Officials reported many tourists leaving motels in <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION> on the coast. More than three inches of rain fell on <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, during a six-hour period ending at 1 a.m., forecasters reported. Thousands of workers from the marshes and offshore oil rigs were evacuated Monday as a precaution. `` We're on cautious alert now and we do n't expect to go beyond that,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Valence </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION>, a coastal town about 40 miles south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Homes were being evacuated today east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in the low-lying <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> fishing villages of <LOCATION> Hopedale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yscloskey </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION>. Coastal tides were three to four feet above normal, but were expected to reach seven feet above normal. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> formed over <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontchartrain </LOCATION> and became a tropical storm Monday. It is rare for an inland storm to move offshore, the weather service said. The danger is that the storm will pick up steam over the Gulf and come back. `` Better this week than next week,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> set Aug. 15-18 in the Superdome. The storm did not delay Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who arrived Monday to address the 1988 Platform Committee. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifa </PERSON> said about 2,000 workers were evacuated by boat and helicopter from offshore rigs to <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leeville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. There were scattered power failures along the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> on Monday and stores reported heavy sales of supplies like flashlights and batteries. But weathering the big storms in the past made some residents blase. `` We went through <PERSON> Camille </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION>, Miss. `` This is too small to worry about.'' Hotel guests on the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, however, started checking out in droves as the stormy weather came Monday. `` We experienced a 50 percent drop in business,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergeron </PERSON>, manager of the Holiday Inn in <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION>. A tropical weather system becomes a named storm when its winds hit 39 mph and a hurricane when wind velocity reaches 74 mph. The last major Gulf Coast hurricane was <ORGANIZATION> Camille </ORGANIZATION> in 1969, which packed 218 mph winds. It killed 320 people and did millions in damage. The <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30 with August and September the most active months.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has indicated it will allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businessmen to launch satellites on Chinese rockets, a pro-Beijing newspaper reported Tuesday. <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Fusheng </PERSON>, vice general manager of <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> unofficially had made it known to Chinese officials that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would not oppose the shipment of satellites to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for launch, the newspaper <PERSON> Wen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Po </PERSON> reported. Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference in this British colony after returning from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> that he could not comment on the report. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 16 </ORGANIZATION> Western nations have held up requests to use Chinese rockets to launch satellites for foreign companies. Security concerns and accusations of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s alleged unfair price advantage because of government subsidization have been cited as reasons for refusing to allow the launches. The newspaper quoted <PERSON> Yu </PERSON>, whose state-run company is in charge of launching satellites on Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Long March rockets, as playing down security concerns. He stressed that the launch service was a business endeavor and not an attempt to obtain foreign technology. Foreign companies would be allowed to watch over their satellites in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the newspaper quoted him as saying. The satellites would be considered in transit from the time they enter <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> through customs until launch, <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> said. He also denied that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would allow its launch service to be used for satellites with military applications, the newspaper reported from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> also claimed that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was able to offer low-priced satellite launchings partly because labor costs are lower than in other countries offering such services and not because of government subsidies. <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, has asked the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to approve Chinese launching of a U.S.-built satellite for an Australian company. <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong-based </LOCATION> consortium, also has asked <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for permission to send up a U.S.-made satellite on a Long March rocket next year. Pressure from Western governments has prevented <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s international satellite launching industry from getting of the ground Although <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has signed accords with several countries, including <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, on space cooperation, the only firm deal has been a joint venture reached with <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. That satellite, to be used to study flora, minerals and underground water supplies, is scheduled for launch in 1992.

 The bodies of 10 people who died in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s worst ferry disaster were cremated Tuesday on the banks of the <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> as police fired seven gunshots in honor of the more than 400 passengers believed drowned. Hindu and Moslem priests prayed as the bodies were placed on wooden logs and set aflame near the river that Hindus consider sacred. About 1,000 relatives and villagers watched silently. The 35-year-old steam-powered ferry overturned Saturday when it hit a sand bar while crossing the river and hurled at least 542 people into the surging waters about 650 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. About 100 people swam to shore or were rescued by villagers in small boats. Only 30 bodies have been recovered and the rest of the passengers are presumed dead, officials said. Most of the passengers were Hindu pilgrims on their way to a shrine. The government blamed the accident on overcrowding and safety violations, according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The ferry had a capacity of 160. Two steam-powered boats and 70 rescue workers have tried to pull the vessel from the river bed, but the search has been hampered by swift currents and rising water levels caused by monsoon rains. <PERSON> Asgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, who heads the recovery effort, said bodies are believed to be trapped inside the ferry, but none have been found so far. He said many of the bodies were carried away by strong currents. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s worst previous ferry disaster occurred in 1970, when at least 150 people drowned in the <LOCATION> Krishna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in the southern state of <LOCATION> Andhra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION>.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today accused <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of trying to `` run away'' from a record `` on the very, very far liberal fringe'' and said his Democratic rival is losing his lead in the presidential race. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at a news conference here, predicted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would fall back from the 17-point advantage he has registered in some national polls. `` That is turning around,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` You watch, in the next couple of days you'll see evidence of the turnaround on that.'' He did not elaborate. Just six days before the opening of the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, where he will become the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he still has not decided who will be his running mate. `` I'm not close in the sense of like tomorrow making a final decision,'' the vice president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he wants to keep it a secret until the final day of the convention. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke at an airport news conference here after a speech earlier in Erie. Later, he planned to fly to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> for a ribbon-cutting at the <ORGANIZATION> Polish-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> and to take part in a crime-fighting effort called the `` National Night Out Against Crime.'' Americans in more than 7,200 towns plan to turn on porch and house lights as a symbolic message that they intend to fight for safer neighborhoods. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not mention <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in his speech, but went after him at the news conference. `` He's trying to run away from a record in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> on the very, very far liberal fringe of the political spectrum, and I have to pin him down and I have to get him to say what he's really for,' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And he's unwilling to do that because he thinks he can preempt the middle.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was urging speakers the GOP convention to be positive and to focus on the issues. `` But I ca n't guarantee that somebody's not going to take a swipe at <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I have a lot of friends out there and they did n't like the vicious, personal attacks -LRB- against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the Democratic convention -RRB- and I did not react to them, but I ca n't control everbody but I'm urging them to stay positive, as I'm doing.'' In Erie earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> blamed liberals in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for undermining the battle against illegal drugs and told a gathering of police officers, `` Let's get tougher on the criminals.'' In a speech billed as non-partisan, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not mention <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by name. But he criticized the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, whose members he has said include <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He said that to win the war against drugs the nation must be as committed as it was in World War II `` when the whole nation then pulled together, one purpose, one cause, everyone working in exactly the same direction. We've got to plan an attack at every level of government.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke before the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police on his last major campaign trip before the Republican National Convention. Trying to forge an image as a hard-liner on law enforcement, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` When it comes to criminal justice our first priority must be to keep the criminals away from the good and decent people who want to raise their families in peace and safety. `` There are those, like the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, whose first concerns are the protection of the criminals' rights and the potential abuse of power by police,'' the vice president said. `` My first concerns are the protection of law-abiding citizens and the abuse of our system of constitutional protections by thugs who can go and hire smart lawyers and find the right judges to set them free. `` So let's not take away the guns of innocent citizens,'' he continued. `` Let's get tougher on the criminals.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that too often police are being denied the ammunition they need to fight the battle against drugs. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is full of rhetorical heroes on the issue of drugs, but when it comes to law enforcement a lot of the liberals there go AWOL,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the budget request for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was slashed by $ 72 million last year in order to provide more money for mass transit and <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, resulting in a 55 percent reduction in <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> air and sea patrols. He also blamed `` the liberals in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'' for derailing sentencing guidelines necessary for implementing a federal death penalty under constitutional standards set by a 1972 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Americans must insist that judges accept new federal sentencing guidelines that mandate consistently tougher penalties. `` We also need to change the legal technicalities that set criminals free,'' he said. `` There's something wrong with the system when the modern-day version of a prison break is crawling through a loophole.'' He praised the administration of former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, now the attorney general-designate, for reducing by 94 percent the early release of convicted felons in the state and said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> effectively ended the early release or parole of first-degree murderers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for more money for building prisons and said that unnecessary military bases should be converted to prisons or rehabilitation facilities. He also urged that states that have decriminalized possession of drugs should reverse course. `` And to those who say drugs should be legalized I say this _ legalization is just another word for surrender, and surrender is not in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s vocabulary.'' One day earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s efforts to compat drug abuse, saying, `` Anybody who can raise the consciousness of the young people of this country about staying away from drugs certainly can have a useful role.'' But he made no promises when asked if the former Democratic presidential candidate might have a role in his administration working on the drug issue.

 The PBS-TV show `` Rumpole of the Bailey Mystery'' has been disqualified as an Emmy nominee in the miniseries category because it was a number of separate stories rather than one continuous show. It has been replaced with <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Bourne Identity,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leverence </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. Producers of `` Rumpole'' incorrectly entered the six-part series as a miniseries, which tells one story with a beginning, middle and ending, <PERSON> Leverence </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` Rumpole,'' he said, has a number of separate stories. Also nominated in the miniseries category was <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Baby M,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <ORGANIZATION> Billionaire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON>'s Lincoln'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Murder of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Phagan </PERSON>.'' `` The Bourne Identity,'' which aired May 8-9, was sixth in the original balloting. It was nominated in two other categories _ single-camera editing and music composition for a miniseries or special. The 40th annual Primetime Emmy Awards will be presented Aug. 28 and will be televised live by <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>.

 Whether he wins the November election or not, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is way ahead in one contest: <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> told more jokes about him than any other political candidate in the first half of 1988. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s monologues on `` The Tonight Show,'' considered one indicator of what people outside politics are thinking, were analyzed by <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Amundson </PERSON> and <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON>. The two researchers, who also looked at comedian <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s monologues on `` Late Night,'' published their findings on political humor in the magazine Public Opinion. `` Poor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endured a veritable comedic vivisection,'' the pair wrote. `` The late-night hosts carved up his record, his campaign tactics and his manhood.'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>, on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speaking ability: `` The last time <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave a speech someone came up and drew a chalk outline around his body.'' In <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>: `` I think <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went too far when he stuffed straw in his overalls and started to sing ` If I Only Had A Brain.''' And during Super Tuesday season: `` Down South he went into a truck stop wearing a pair of overalls, but he had a little alligator sewn over the pocket.'' <PERSON> Amundson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> looked at the <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> monologues from Jan. 1 to June 7. They found that <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> was far more political than <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> and included jokes about at least one candidate in nearly every new episode of his show. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, has said he pays close attention to the <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> monologues `` as a barometer of how the candidates play in the ` real' <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> beyond the beltway,'' the highway that encircles <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Amundson </PERSON> said. And <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s not the only one. `` When <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> talks, candidates have to listen,'' says <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON>. `` They listen to hear what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is hearing.'' Republican contenders were the butt of <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s jokes twice as often as the Democrats, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the target of 32 barbs followed by <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> with 18 and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> with 17. On the Democratic side, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> attracted 15 jokes, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was the target of nine and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbit </PERSON> drew five. The lower numbers for the Democrats `` reflect the writers strike that put ` The Tonight Show' on reruns during the peak of Democratic campaigning in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' the authors said. `` It certainly does n't mean they were any less laughable than the Republicans.'' The <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> jokes centered on his relationship with model <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, starting in January when <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> remarked that `` <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> made a stunning statement today. He said if he was elected he would not be the first adulterer in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but he would be the best.'' <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> got into the act, the researchers reported, on the day President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had his annual physical. `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says he has the body of a 20-year-old _ which if I remember correctly is very much like the <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> campaign slogan,'' the comedian said. <PERSON> Amundson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> said most of the jokes focused on gaffes and personal foibles, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s appearance and `` the utter hopelessness'' of <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>'s quest. `` I'm not sure if I want a president who has to draw in his face,'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said after what the researchers called `` the mysterious appearance'' of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s eyebrows before the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses. And when <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> cracked, `` <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> lending support to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is like <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> lending her bra to <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> disputed <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s claim that Planned Parenthood was formed to create a master race. Obviously that's not true, <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said, or we'd have a better class of presidential candidates. Conspicuously absent from the barrage of quips was Democratic nominee <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a straight-laced candidate. <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Amundson </PERSON> are thinking of continuing their survey through the general election campaign `` just to see if <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> can find something funny about <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.''

<TEXT>
 Soviet astronomers are proposing an orbiting, 100-ton `` superobservatory,'' more massive than anything planned in the West, to be launched late in this century. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kardashev </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that preliminary engineering studies of the superobservatory envision three powerful instruments to gain unprecedented views of the heavens. In an interview at the 20th assembly of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kardashev </PERSON> said plans call for parts of the observatory to be sent into Earth orbit aboard the Soviet's powerful Energia rocket The observatory would be assembled in orbit `` either by robots or by astronauts and cosmonauts,'' he said. A second rocket then would send the observatory to the so-called Lagrangian point L-2 about 900,000 miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> where the gravitational attraction of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, moon and sun balance each other. An object left in L-2 would remain at that point. `` This would give a very high resolution of the whole universe,'' said <PERSON> Kardashev </PERSON>. He said the sun, <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and moon would be visible at all times from L-2 in one direction, while the rest of the universe could be seen by pointing instruments outward, away from the sun. An observatory at L-2 would orbit the sun in about the same period as the Earth. <PERSON> Kardashev </PERSON> said instruments proposed for the observatory are an X-ray and gamma-ray detector, a 400-meter radio telescope and a 10-meter optical telescope. The optical telescope would be about four times more powerful than the $ 1 billion space telescope planned for launch next year by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kardashev </PERSON> said observation data collected by the instruments would be sent by radio signals to ground stations or satellites, and the observatory would be able to operate around the clock. `` This would be a very big project and we are very interested in international cooperation,'' he said. <PERSON> Kardashev </PERSON> said the cost would be `` one billion rubles or dollars'' but American astronomers say a project of the scale decribed by the Soviets would cost must more than that. The Soviet scientist said it is believed that if the project is started soon, it would be ready for launch by the year 2000. The Soviets said in a statement the superobservatory `` can only be realized in the context of broad, international collaboration.'' `` We herewith invite all interested parties to contact us at their earliest convenience,'' the announcement said.

<TEXT>
 White House officials prepared today to announce a successor to Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> amid indications the job will go to <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who could become the first Hispanic Cabinet member. Administration officials would not discuss plans to announce the choice to succeed <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who announced in May that he wished to leave the administration by around mid-September. Nor would officials confirm that <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> was set to be nominated for the post, although it was learned that the 61-year-old college president had traveled from the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> campus in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> to the nation's capital. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> had been scheduled to appear today at a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> officials and representatives of the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and the Governor's <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, but did not attend that meeting. Neither <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> could immediately be reached for comment. <PERSON> Loye </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, declined to comment. The <ORGANIZATION> Lubbock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avalanche-Journal </ORGANIZATION> had quoted sources as saying that <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> was being considered for the job. The newspaper said today that it was told by sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> was `` on a very short list'' of candidates. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, who has served as <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>'s president since April 1980, received the National Hispanic Leadership award of the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> in July for his work in education. He was cited for his efforts to reduce the dropout rate among Hispanic youth. Several <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> residents told the newspaper that they had been contacted in the last few days by federal agents conducting a background check on <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>. They were not given reasons for the queries, which are a routine part of the appointment process. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>' possible selection might be considered an effort by Republicans to court the Hispanic vote in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> since he is a native of that area and a son of a foreman of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gertrudis </LOCATION> Division of the storied King Ranch. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> announced in May that he would resign as president of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> in July 1989 and, after a leave, return to teach anatomy in the medical school, where he has tenure.

 South Korean officials, disappointed that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> rejected a proposal to work out details for full-scale negotiations, said they will agree to a meeting on the communist nation's demand to be co-host of the Olympics, sources said Tuesday. A North Korean letter delivered Tuesday said there was not enough time to hold `` a preliminary contact and then the full talks under the present condition where 40 days ... are left until the opening of the Olympic Games that must be debated as an urgent agenda item.'' The Olympic Games start Sept. 17 in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said it will boycott unless it can be co-host. The International Olympic Committee refused that demand and said the Olympics are awarded to a city, not a country. The letter from <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyong </PERSON> <PERSON> Sop </PERSON>, chairman of the rubberstamp <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, called for a meeting in <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> on Aug. 17 that would be limited to discussing logistical arrangements, with a first full parliamentary meeting to be held in its capital of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> on Aug. 26. South Korean had called for detailed preliminary talks on working out an agenda for full-scale negotiations. The North Korean letter was addressed to <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chae-sun </PERSON> and delivered at the border truce site of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>. `` The Aug. 17 meeting is expected to come off as proposed by the <PERSON> North </PERSON>, but the overall picture of the situation is rather disappointing,'' said one source at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity. A few hours after the North Korean letter was delivered, political party leaders met and said they would send a reply by the end of this week. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dong-bok </PERSON>, chief secretary to the <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> speaker, said after the meeting that a notable feature of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s letter is its stress on the inclusion of `` personages of various parties, organizations and circles'' as full members of the proposed parliamentary talks. The <ORGANIZATION> Hankook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION>, a mass-circulation national daily, said, `` Any agreement can hardly be expected, because -LRB- <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> -RRB- insists on including `` personages of parties, organizations and circles,'' <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>'s reference to dissident groups in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Sources in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> said the tone of the North Korean letter is not conciliatory and is rather `` rude,'' in sharp contrast with North Korean proposals in the past. `` Dialogue may be opened, but the real fruit of the parliamentary talks can hardly expected,'' The <ORGANIZATION> Chosun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION>, an influential national newspaper, said in a commentary. <ORGANIZATION> Hankook </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> appears to be eager to find a new excuse to boycott the Olympic Games by making demands <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> can hardly accept. Both papers noted that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said the talks were urgent while proposing Aug. 17 as a meeting date. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> had earlier suggested a meeting begin Aug. 11. The papers also noted that the date is two days after Aug. 15, when South Korean radical students plan to march to the border for talks with North Korean youths on national unfication. `` It is obvious that all this is intended to stir unrest in our society,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hankook </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> fears the north may use terrorism to try and disrupt the Olympics. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was implicated in the Nov. 29 bombing of a South Korean airliner with the deaths of all 115 people aboard. Most observers believe there is little chance <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> will drop its demand to be co-host of the Olympics and agree to take part. Such a change would represent a total turnabout after 40 years of bitter rivalry. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> sees the holding of the Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> as a major political defeat since both sides claim to be the sole legitimate government on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1950 to start the Korean War. The two sides technically remain at war since no peace treaty was signed when an armistice halted fighting in 1953.

<HEAD>Official Mine Wage Protest Fails To Materialize</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Work went on uninterrupted Tuesday in a copper mine complex despite a call by the industry's official union for a brief wage protest there. There were conflicting explanations on why the protest did not take place and about recent developments at the <LOCATION> Rudna </LOCATION> mine. Government officials said the protest was called off by leaders of the local, officially recognized copper union after they received a telegram from the Industry Ministry proposing talks. Officials of the banned Solidarity trade union, which had urged workers to ignore the call, said miners simply refused to go along with the protest. Solidarity officials asked miners to reject the call because the protest focused on wage issues and not safety demands, which the banned union maintains are at the core of disputes with mine management. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said Tuesday the official union called off the protest after receiving the ministry telegram. Local Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugalski </PERSON> said the official union had gone ahead with the protest action, trying to turn off conveyor belts to force a work stoppage. <PERSON> Sugalski </PERSON> said miners refused to carry out the orders. The local copper workers' union, part of the national federation of trade unions, on Monday distributed an appeal calling for a one-to two-hour work stoppage in the copper mining industries of lower <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION>, said Solidarity advisor <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> said the official union's failure to mention safety conditions amounted to an attempt to thwart Solidarity-led efforts to bring changes to the industry. He said the wage issue is secondary to safety demands because management has shown a willingness to meet pay demands. The action by the official union appeared designed to head off protests by Solidarity supporters at the <LOCATION> Rudna </LOCATION> mine, outside the town of <LOCATION> Lubin </LOCATION>. An independent mining commission at the <LOCATION> Rudna </LOCATION> mine has charged that miners must work at temperatures that exceed industry norms. The miners have given management until Aug. 15 to adhere to an earlier agreement to improve working conditions. They threatened protest actions if management did not comply.

<HEAD>Falling Water Levels Force Restrictions On Montana Trout Streams</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s Fish and Game Commission has adopted emergency fishing regulations to help preserve trout endangered by dwindling water in many drought-ravaged streams and rivers. The commission's action is a `` good start,'' said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradshaw </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> chapter of Trout Unlimited. `` It's a recognition, at least, that times are tough.'' In a related action, the commission agreed with a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> proposal to make more antelope, deer and elk permits available this year in many hunting districts. A low harvest last year, combined with drought-withered forage available for this winter, convinced the commissioners that hunters should be given a chance to harvest game before the animals starve. The fishing restrictions, which take effect Friday and will last at least through February, apply to most trout streams east of the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> and a few in western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, the commission said Monday. Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks personnel said this is the first time the commission has been forced to take emergency steps to deal with a drought's impacts on fisheries. Most seriously affected by the changes will be the central fishing district, where limits will be reduced from five trout to two trout on most waterways. `` Most of the rivers and streams in the district are at or near record low flows for this time of year,'' <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION>, Wildlife and Parks' Fisheries Division, told the commission. `` The situation is bad and getting worse, and we have to do what we can to protect the state's wild trout fishery. `` At this point, rain is not going to solve the problem. If more trout begin to die as a result of the low stream flows and high water temperatures, the detrimental impacts on the fisheries will be apparent for several years.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> noted that his agency does not stock streams with hatchery fish, so `` the imposition of emergency restrictions is the only way we can offer protection to the wild trout in these streams that will spawn in the fall and spring.'' `` We depend on wild rainbow and brown trout to maintain our fish populations,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. If water levels continue to decline, fishing bans in key spawning areas may be requested at the commission's September meeting, he warned.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> said today it will urge Catholics not to see the film `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' while two fundamentalist preachers complained they were turned away from screenings. The conference rated the film `` morally offensive'' to the nation's 53 million Catholics and said it was theologically flawed. Although a memo to the bishops said the film is `` clearly contrary to the teachings of the church,'' it said public protests against the film would give the film further publicity. The two Protestant preachers, the Revs. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, have been critical of the film, although neither has seen it. An 18-member of the Catholic group saw the film at a screening Monday, the <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> -RRB- News reported today. Directed by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>, the film depicts <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as someone who is tempted to resist what Christians believe is his divinity, until the point of death on the cross. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> hallucinates during a dream sequence in the movie that he marries and has sex with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdelene </PERSON>. In the face of protests from religious groups, <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> announced the film, based on a novel by the Greek author <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON>, would open Friday, more than a month ahead of schedule. The studio has been previewing the film this week. The cast includes <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON> -LRB- `` Platoon'' -RRB- as <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON> -LRB- `` <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> and Her Sisters'' -RRB- as <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON> and rock star <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> as <PERSON> Pontius </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilate </PERSON>. In the memo released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the conference said the movie dwells on sexual rather than spiritual love and contains excessive graphic violence. The conference suggested the church use the issuance of the film `` as an opportunity to place before our people again the true image of Christ.'' Universal turned down a request by <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> minister, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tupelo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, to see a preview scheduled to be held in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> today, the minister's group said. It also withdrew an invitation to <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> for a Wednesday screening there, according to a <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> spokesman. <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> was turned away `` because you have chosen to speak out against <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> with regard to the film without seeing it, and because you rejected our earlier offer to see the film on July 12,'' said a letter from Universal. The studio noted <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s criticism in withdrawing its invitation to him, said <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON>. The former <ORGANIZATION> Moral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Majority </ORGANIZATION> leader has joined other ministers in calling for a boycott of <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiaries. <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> refused Monday to apologize for condemning the film and accused the studio of hypocrisy.

 Thousands of Burmese demonstrated against President <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> on Tuesday and troops opened fire, killing at least 36 people in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and 26 other cities, officials and diplomats reported. Some diplomats said hundreds may have been killed or wounded in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, where soldiers fired into crowds with shotguns and other weapons. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> quoted witnesses as saying protesters marched through the streets of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> carrying bodies of dead comrades over their heads. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> radio said five people were killed and 55 wounded in the capital, and the toll was 31 dead and 37 wounded at Sagaing in central <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, where 5,000 people tried to overrun a police station. It said the casualty count was continuing. Military authorities imposed an 8 p.m.-4 a.m. curfew on <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million people. Martial law was declared in the capital after a student protest march Aug. 3. Unusually detailed reports by the state radio said security forces were forced to shoot on four occasions Tuesday and arrested 1,451 `` looters and disturbance makers.'' Whether that figure include more than 800 arrests announced earlier was not clear. It named 26 towns and cities besides <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> where protests occurred, including <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, which is <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s seconden shut since student riots in June. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a 27-year-old Australian architect who arrived in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, described the scene Tuesday as `` a game of cat and mouse'' in which `` the army was chasing.'' He reported seeing up to 600 soldiers, some with machine guns, at <LOCATION> Shwedagon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pagoda </LOCATION>, one of the main sites of recent anti-government protests. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said parts of the city were cordoned off with barricades and roadblocks manned by soldiers. On a drive from <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, the Australian said, he saw six armored cars and up to 20 truckloads of troops heading for the capital. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, a 25-year-old American, said most stores were closed and no buses ran. `` There was a lot of public support for the demonstrators, `` he said. Another tourist said people in some homes cooked food for the protesters. A Western diplomat in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said, speaking privately: `` This is a tragedy. Our reports say the crowds have been very conciliatory -LRB- towards security forces -RRB-. Things are going from bad to worse.'' The demonstrations, which began to spread beyond <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> on Monday, are by far the largest show of protest since democracy was ended in this Southeast Asian nation by a military coup in 1962 that brought Ne Win to power. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a former general, became president and head of the ruling party when Ne Win stepped down last month. Students accuse him of the bloody suppression of riots in March and June. Diplomats said most protests in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> have occurred at the Sule Pagoda and Maha Bandoola Square downtown and at the hilltop Shwedagon Pagoda in the northern suburbs. Burmese embassies have tried to screen out journalists applying for tourist visas. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> has been unable to enter the country and its <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> correspondent, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, was arrested last month along with several critics of the government. Travelers from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> in recent days have quoted Burmese as saying <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> was the most hated man in the country. Ne Win had full support from the officer corps, but most analysts believe loyalty to <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> is only partial. Some feel that could have more bearing on <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s future than riots by unarmed students.

 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> II, the movie, is already causing some concern for networks that got caught in a film controversy at the Republican National Convention four years ago. Despite some grumbling after this year's Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the three big networks will give the Republicans equal time for the four-day GOP convention next week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, though with smaller staffs. A filmed tribute to the outgoing president is on the program Monday, and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the expected nominee, will be featured in another film Thursday. `` I'm still waiting for something definitive from the party on the length,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Angotti </PERSON>, executive producer of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s convention coverage `` There is a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> film which I do n't feel obligated to carry, because <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is not a candidate.'' When <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was a candidate, in 1984, the three networks parted company on carrying the 18-minute promotional film shown to the convention. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> carried it all, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> carried excerpts and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> used the time during the film to show its own report on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's successes and failures. This time, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> may cover the film as a news story, `` using the journalistic standards we use for other stories,'' executive producer <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Venardos </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` We'll have to see it before deciding,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Gralnick </PERSON>, executive producer for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. At the Democratic convention, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> decided not to carry a six-minute film about presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, filling the time with commentary and a commercial. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> all carried that film. As of Monday, it was n't even certain how long the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> films would run _ <PERSON> Venardos </PERSON> said he had been told that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s film ran 18 minutes and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 12 minutes, while <PERSON> Angotti </PERSON> said he had been told that each ran about 20 to 25 minutes During the Democratic convention, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Roone </PERSON> <PERSON> Arledge </PERSON> had complained that the carefully orchestrated proceedings were `` driving people at home not to watch,'' and raised the possibility of cutting back coverage of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> event. However, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> will join <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS in giving the Republicans an equal two-hour block of prime time Monday through Thursday, from 9 to 11 p.m. EDT. The Republicans have scheduled some nights to run past 11 p.m., including the roll call which will nominate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the party's presidential candidate. <PERSON> Venardos </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> will stay with the roll call at least until <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has secured the nomination _ which is expected to be when <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> casts its votes. `` That is really why we are here,'' <PERSON> Venardos </PERSON> said. `` I think viewers care a lot about seeing and hearing their home state.'' `` I think you have to play these things by ear,'' <PERSON> Angotti </PERSON> said. `` The more you say in advance about what you might do or not do, the more trouble you get into.'' `` From this vantage point, I will say exactly what I said before <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> _ our plans are for 9-11 p.m.. We have n't seen a schedule which tells us what we need to know to make precise plans,'' <PERSON> Gralnick </PERSON> said All three networks will use fewer people to cover the Republicans than they deployed in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and all said that's at least partly because Republicans have no one comparable to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who was still in the presidential race in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and made noises about challenging for the vice-presidential slot. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> is cutting 100 from its staff, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> is paring 50 and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> plans to cut 25 to 30. They will still send hundreds. `` We had more delegate reporters last time than we are going to have here,'' <PERSON> Angotti </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` We're going to rely more with our affiliates who are with the delegations to come up with whatever news there is.'' <PERSON> Venardos </PERSON> said the smaller staff also reflected `` things we learned to do more efficiently in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. ... It was n't so much coverage, as how to schedule people more efficiently.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> is economizing by not taking `` Nightline'' to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, and is using one control room instead of two. `` It's due to the fact that it's a one-candidate convention,'' <PERSON> Gralnick </PERSON> said. `` There are fewer hotels to cover, fewer candidate possibiliies, less of a breaking news situation than in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> plans no cut in its staff of nearly 300, said network spokesman <PERSON> Kitsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassett </PERSON>, and no reduction in coverage time which extended nearly 70 hours during the Democratic convention. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> will go live at 11 a.m. Monday for the first convention session. With the presidential nomination locked up, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign is banking on the vice presidency to boost ratings. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he will not announce his choice until the convention's final day. `` I'm for doing anything that will help build a TV audience,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager, said Monday. The Democratic convention was watched, on average, by less than a fourth of the nation's homes with television. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> did best with an average rating of 7.4, while <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had 6.9, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had 6.5 and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> had an average of 2.0 for the evening prime-time hours. Each rating point represents 1 percent of the nation's 88.6 million homes with TV.

 Soviet officials Tuesday began counting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruise missiles at two sites in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> as part of inspections allowed under the superpower arms treaty. The first team of 10 Soviet inspectors arrived by bus at the European Repair Facility at <LOCATION> Gosselies </LOCATION>, about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, to check missiles at a maintenance site. They paused for photographs and then went quickly into a one-story building that is part of the operations run by the Belgian defense contractor <ORGANIZATION> Sabca </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a straightforward kind of process,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Findley </PERSON>. `` This is bean-counting, going in and looking at what the treaty says are limited and figuring it out.'' The Soviets, he said, would have a chance to measure unarmed cruise missiles removed from their canisters for repair or maintenance. `` They may take special measurements and check because this is the only place they can do it,'' <PERSON> Findley </PERSON> said. There was no indication how many missiles were at the facility, the only one of its kind in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> set up to maintain and repair the weapons. The number can vary daily. On June 21, there were 55 missiles at the plant, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. A second team of 10 inspectors went to <LOCATION> Florennes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, 10 miles north of the repair facility. Sixteen ground-launched cruise missiles and four spares are kept at the base along with four launchers and eight spares, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. The sleek, ground-hugging weapons, which arrived in March 1985, are jet-propelled, winged missiles with advanced guidance systems. They are 21 feet long. The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty provides the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with unprecedented review of each other's facilities. The Soviets are visiting 30 sites in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and five Western European countries. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts are inspecting 133 sites in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Each inspection can last up to 24 hours, with a possible eight-hour extension. The Soviet experts, who arrived Monday, spent the night in a <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> hotel and notified authorities Tuesday that they wanted to inspect the two sites. They were expected to spend Tuesday night at the facilities and return to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Wednesday. They will leave <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> later Wednesday or Thursday. The Soviets were taken on a two-hour bus tour of the historic capital with <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> MacNamee </PERSON>. He said they expressed interest in the Gothic and Baroque architecture. <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> is the fourth Western European country visited by the Soviet teams since the 60-day inspection process began July 1. They have visited <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. They have yet to inspect sites in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The treaty provides for elimination within three years of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges from about 300 to 3,400 miles. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the treaty in December in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

Now, with the help of a new series of public service television announcements, they may well become celebrities, symbols of a new literacy campaign stressing youth problems being jointly launched by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> television network and the Public Broadcasting System. The yearlong campaign, called Youth @ PLUS, was first announced in April, and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and PBS began broadcasting public service announcements last month. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, president of communications of Capital Cities @ <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters Tuesday that several new 30 - and 60-second spots will be shown starting September The public service messages, <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said, will stress the connection between illiteracy and youth problems including teen-age pregnancy, unemployment, delinquency and substance abuse. Each spot, he said, feature a youngster telling his or her story of how such problems contributed to their inability to read. Beginning in October, the networks will broadcast an additional series of spots celebrating families that read together, and <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> will broadcast a documentary on family reading, `` First Things First,'' on Oct. 19. In January, a final set of public service announcements will focus on `` unsung Americans'' who have done local illiteracy volunteer work. PLUS, or Project Literacy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, was first launched by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and focused primarily on adult non-readers, <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Governors' Meeting Erupts In Debate over Constitutional Amendments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's governors, after three days of harmony, closed out their annual meeting Tuesday with an acrimonious debate over whether to change the method of amending the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution. Present but not participating in that debate, was Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, the Democratic presidential nominee, who attended only the final session of the 80th meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor sat silent while Govs. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lousiana </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Carroll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> dropped all pretense of harmony. `` You've turned the Constitution on its head,'' said <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, presiding over the final session of his year as <ORGANIZATION> NGA </ORGANIZATION> chairman, suggested to <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> that they debate the issue on television, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor replied, `` I know how eager you are for the -LRB- camera's -RRB- red light, Governor <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>.'' `` And I know how eager you are to avoid it,'' retorted <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. There was minimal debate and no roll call votes as the governors quickly approved policy positions on issues ranging from housing and jobs to transportation and tourism. Also approved on a voice vote was a call by the governors to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to consider amending the Constitution to provide that if 34 states agreed on a constitutional amendment, it would be submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which could block it by a two-thirds vote or send it back to the states for ratification. Currently, amendments may be proposed by a vote of two-thirds of each house of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or by a national convention called by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Amendments become part of the Constitution after ratification by legislatures of three-fourths of the states or by conventions in three-fourths of the states. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decides which form of ratification should be used. State legislatures or conventions are given seven years in which to ratify most amendments. Many state legislatures have adopted resolutions calling for a constitutional convention to consider an amendment to require a balanced federal budget, but the number has fallen short of that required to force convening of a convention. After the voice vote approving the proposal dealing with constitutional amendments, Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> said the proposal `` divisive and contentious'' and asked <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> to refer it to the <ORGANIZATION> NGA </ORGANIZATION> executive committee for further consideration. The discussion grew a little more heated when <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, conceding he had not objected before the vote, denounced the proposal as `` a half-baked notion.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> had not attended the first three days of the conference and <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> noted that `` some of us have been here for the entire conference; some of us came in only for the last show.'' The debate finally was resolved when <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> suggested that all governors put their views of the proposal in writing and promised to attach them to the resolution when it was submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took part in a light moment at the close of the meeting, when he and Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> stepped to the podium to make a presentation to Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, who will be the keynote speaker at the Republican National Convention next week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Throughout the <ORGANIZATION> NGA </ORGANIZATION> meeting, governors needled <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> about his overly long speech at the Democratic convention. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> turned to <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> and presented him with a plastic shopping bag and said, `` Just in case you have the same kind of problem he -LRB- <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> -RRB- did, we thought you might want to take this.'' Inside the bag was an hour glass.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A consumer group accused oil companies Tuesday of pocketing the savings from lower crude oil prices instead of passing them along to motorists in the form of lower gasoline prices. `` Instead of passing on lower prices to consumers, major oil companies are increasing their profits,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizen-Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, director of finance, accounting and statistics for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, denied the charge. `` The idea that the oil companies are colluding to keep the prices up is just pure garbage,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. `` There is absolutely no evidence that that is the case.'' The consumer group released a study of oil and gasoline prices compiled from a variety of sources including the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>. `` Oil companies reduced inventories at the beginning of the summer and kept gasoline production low in order to limit supplies and raise prices,'' <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> said. He said that while the price of crude oil fell from 38 cents a gallon in January to 35 cents in July, retail gasoline prices rose from $ 1.09 to $ 1.13. <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> added that many companies chose to emphasize production of their highest octane and most profitable gasoline, which also had the effect of increasing prices. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> replied that there is always a lag between crude prices and the price charged at the pump. Gasoline prices did n't rise last year until two months or more after increases in crude costs, he said, and the same lag is occurring this year with crude oil declines. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said that as of May 1, gasoline stocks totaled 225 million barrels, 10 million barrels lass that a year earlier but somewhat more than the two prior years.

<HEAD>For $5, Folks Learn What Their Family Treasures Are Worth</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Art appraisers <PERSON> Stacey </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Jelley </PERSON> were in town anyway for an auction of works from two failed banks, so folks at the <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> and Art figured they'd use their services for a fund-raiser. For a $ 5 donation to the museum, people were invited to bring in their family treasures Monday and find out from the experts what they were really worth. There were no major finds and a lot of disappointment as the appraisers spent five hours reviewing a host of objets d'art, but a few people learned their pieces were at least good buys. Roman said he mostly examined `` a lot of photo reproductions.. a lot of decorative pieces,'' and said things like, `` It would cost you more to get it framed than it's worth.'' He said he developed the phrase `` decorative piece'' because `` it's better than telling somebody it's a piece of junk. ... Just because it does n't have a lot of value does n't mean it does n't have sentimental value.'' Roman and <PERSON> Jelley </PERSON> work for the California-based art auction house of <ORGANIZATION> Butterfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Butterfield </LOCATION>, and the main purpose of their visit is Wednesday night's auction of a collection acquired by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as a result of its takeover of two failed <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> banks. The collection includes a huge <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> Laurence rendition of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McKinley </LOCATION>, valued $ 180,000 to $ 220,000, and some other works valued at more than $ 10,000. `` Literally, it's a treasure hunt,'' Roman said. He is director of the auction house's painting department and his hope was to unearth paintings worth shipping to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for sale. <ORGANIZATION> Butterfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Butterfield charges commissions ranging from 35 percent for items that sell for $ 100 or less, to 10 percent for pieces sold for $ 5,000 or more. `` Basically, my job is to look at beautiful things all day,'' Roman said. And every day hope springs anew that someone will pull out of a plastic bag `` some amazing painting that's never been seen in 100 years.'' But it was not to be Monday. <PERSON> Jelley </PERSON> said he saw `` a nice little rug and a cast bronze bust,'' but the only thing perhaps worth shipping to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> was a silver tea set he plans to research some more. Other items produced included a large parchment page of Gregorian chant, brought back from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after World War II, whose owner believed it dated from the Middle Ages; a Hungarian mirror painting _ a religious scene purchased 21 years ago for $ 20 in a <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> antique shop; and a sealed bottle of Old Mr. <PERSON> Boston </PERSON> <PERSON> Straight </PERSON> <PERSON> Rye </PERSON> <PERSON> Whisky </PERSON> from the Prohibition era. The parchment, it turned out, was probably 19th-century and not worth much. But the Hungarian mirror painting was definitely a good buy. It would probably bring about $ 600 at auction, <PERSON> Jelley </PERSON> told its owner, who had talked her way past Hungarian border guards when they questioned whether she should be allowed to take the painting out of their country. The whiskey too had no value at auction, because while wine can be auctioned off, it is against the law to auction hard liquor. So what are <PERSON> Jorene </PERSON> and Shield Downey going to do with grandma's medicinal pint, preserved so carefully all these years `` Our anniversary is on Valentine's Day,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said. `` We're going to drink it.''

<HEAD>Fed Tries To Dampen Inflation by Hiking Bank Lending Rate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, in a move to fight inflation, said Tuesday it was boosting its key bank lending rate for the first time in nearly a year. Analysts said other interest rates likely would head higher as a result. With only three months left before the presidential election, the board members, all appointed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, sent a dramatic signal that they were willing to push up interest rates to dampen inflationary pressures even at the risk of endangering Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential aspirations. The increase in the discount rate, from 6 percent to 6.5 percent, was adopted by a 6-0 vote and took effect immediately. It was the first change since Sept. 4 and put the rate at its highest in more than two years. An increase in the discount rate, which is the fee the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> charges for short-term loans to member banks, is the central bank's most direct way of pushing interest rates higher as a curb on economic growth Economists said jumps in other interest rates, including those on mortgage rates and credit cards, are likely to follow. `` This will hit consumer pocketbooks fairly soon,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanston </PERSON>, a government securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said banks likely will raise their prime rate, the interest they charge their most creditworthy commercial customers, this week or next. Since May, banks have raised their prime rate by a full point to 9.5 percent, the highest since March 1986. And because more people are borrowing through home equity loans and adjustable rate mortgages, which are tied to rate fluctuations, consumers will feel the effects of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s action much more rapidly than in previous years, he said. Investors, particularly foreign investors, have been skeptical that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would have the stomach to make such a move with the presidential election on the line. However, with this increase, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said, `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> proved beyond any reasonable doubt that it does have a backbone and that it is willing to fight inflation even in an election year.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration was disappointed with the increase, but he refrained from criticizing <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>. `` We're always disappointed when interest rates go up, but we understand there is a reason for it,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters. `` We think the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has done a good job. ... We think the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s on the right course.'' The board, in a statement, said its decision `` reflects the intent of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to reduce inflationary pressures.'' Consumer prices, which rose 4.4 percent last year, are expected to increase by more than 5 percent this year and perhaps more than 6 percent next year, analysts are predicting. By making it more expensive to borrow money, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> hopes to check inflation by slowing consumer demand. High employment is putting more dollars in the hands of consumers. At the same time, factories are operating at their highest capacity levels in eight years. They are straining to produce enough goods for both domestic buyers and foreigners, who have been buying more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products in response to the devaluation of the dollar through the end of last year. The danger of accelerating inflation is present because too many dollars are chasing too few goods. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, consulting firm, said the discount rate hike likely will push the value of the dollar, which has been recovering since early this year, still higher. That eventually could choke off the improvement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit by making American products more expensive overseas, he said. Prices on both the stock and bond markets fell after the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement Analysts had expected the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to tighten its reins on the money supply this week, but most were expecting the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to make the less dramatic move of pushing up the federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> noted in its statement that the action it chose `` was taken in light of the growing spread of market interest rates over the discount rate.'' Since early March, it had pushed the federal funds rate up by more than a percentage point to 7.75 percent while keeping the discount rate the same. Too great a spread between the rates tempts banks to try to misuse the `` discount window'' by borrowing from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and lending to other banks at a profit. Tuesday's discount rate increase was the second rate hike since <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> became <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman a year ago. In September the central bank boosted the rate from 5.5 percent to 6 percent, the first increase in three years. That move also was taken in response to inflationary fears, but was later cited by some analysts as a contributing factor to the October stock market crash. After the crash, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> loosened money supplies again in midwinter, when rising business inventories raised concern that the economy was softening. Since then, however, government statistics have portrayed a strong economy and concern has shifted from recession to inflation. Prior to September, the last increase in the discount rate had come April 6, 1984, when the rate was boosted from 8.5 percent to 9 percent. The rate was then cut seven successive times, with the last reduction on Aug. 20, 1986, when it dropped from 6 percent to 5.5 percent, the lowest level in nearly a decade.

<TEXT>
 A state board today assumed control of the city's finances and threatened defiant council members with criminal charges in an effort force them to accept a court-ordered desegregation plan. `` In short, our goal is to save <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> from itself,'' said Secretary of State <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Yonkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The board voted 5-1 to impose a wage and hiring freeze and made council members who refuse to obey rules for fiscal responsibility subject to misdemeanor charges. The four council members who voted against the desegregation plan ordered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON> already are paying fines and face a threat of imprisonment beginning Thursday on Sand's contempt of court citation. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 2nd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> today said it would rule on a city request to stay $ 500-a-day fines against the councilmen and bankrupting fines against <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>. The panel did not say when it would rule. The control board, established by Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> earlier in the decade when <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> came near bankruptcy, has sweeping powers to control the budget of the state's fourth largest city. It could remove the councilmen from office. City Manager <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLuca </PERSON> cast the single negative vote because `` the control board is not strong enough at this time to avert fiscal disaster ... We may have to look to other entities to join me in resolving this issue.'' Mayor <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasiscko </PERSON>, who has called a council meeting for Wednesday night, said, `` The only thing that will make any difference is the threat of removal'' from office. Sand fined the city $ 100 the first day, doubling daily so that by day 22 the amount would have wiped out the city's $ 337 million budget. <PERSON> DeLuca </PERSON> said the city would begin mass layoffs if the situation was not resolved by Monday. Sand, who in 1985 found the city liable for intentionally segregating its schools and housing over 40 years, found the city and councilmen in contempt last week when the council voted 4-3 against a resolution supporting the construction of 800 units of affordable housing throughout the city. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sculnick </PERSON>, attorney for the city, asked the appellate panel today to put the fines on hold pending a full appeal of Sand's contempt order because if they continued, `` the city will be bankrupt in less than two weeks.'' Lawyers for the councilmen argued that Sand had exceeded his authority by ordering passage of legislation that would implement the housing plan. `` There are limits to a federal court's authority even to remedy an unconstitutional action,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, attorney for Councilman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Chema </PERSON>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assocation </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, contended that the appeals court had a duty to Sand. `` The dignity of the federal court is under assault,'' said <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON>, `` by a group of citizens who think they're above the law. <PERSON> DeLuca </PERSON>, who has pinpointed Aug. 21 as the last day the state's fourth largest city can pay the price of defiance, said if the appeals panel denied the stay, he would write to Sand asking him to grant a stay himself and initiate round-the-clock negotiations to resolve the crisis But <PERSON> DeLuca </PERSON> said the city has about $ 66 million cash on hand and the last day the city can pay a fine is Aug. 21, when the daily fine is $ 26.1 million, but the cumulative fine would be $ 52.4 million. He said he still hoped <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> would intervene or that one of the councilmen would change his vote. Sand had called for the governor's assistance, noting the governor's power to remove elected officials. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has said he is reluctant to do that because it would be complicated and the city has appealed the contempt finding. Getting a councilman to change his vote would be difficult, too, `` because they're all heroes now,'' said <PERSON> DeLuca </PERSON>. The four, Vice Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Longo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chema </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON>, may face additional financial pressure if a citizens' group goes ahead and files a $ 100 million civil suit against them for negligence, dereliction of duty, illegal conduct and waste <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON>, an attorney and vice president of Citizens and Neighbors Organized to Protect <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, said the four councilmen had violated state law and the City Charter by their actions and had caused the city irreparable harm publicly and financially.

 Eight drought-plagued rivers set records for low water last month, including all-time records in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey reported Tuesday. The North Fork of the <LOCATION> Edisto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Orangeburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, averaged 141 million gallons of water per day for the month, the least amount of water for any month ever measured in that river in 49 years of recordkeeping. And on July 15 the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Muscoda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, recorded its lowest one-day flow ever at 1.2 billion gallons. That river has been measured for 75 years. Six other rivers, including the once mighty <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, had their lowest flows for any July on record, the survey reported. Even so, July had fewer record lows than the 33 recorded in June. `` Rains have brought some spotty improvement in streamflows and reservoir levels around the country,'' reported <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziglar </PERSON>, assistant secretary of interior. But, he added, `` the overall water-resources situation remains one of concern.'' `` Perhaps most striking, the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> itself, pipeline for nearly half the streamflow in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, set a new monthly low, the lowest July in at least 54 years, and at least 13 percent lower than the record low set in June,'' <PERSON> Ziglar </PERSON> said. Flow in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, averaged 108 billion gallons per day during July, 60 percent below the median for the month. That flow broke the previous low record of 119 billion gallons per day set in July 1934. That also meant the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> remained the nation's second largest river in July, trailing the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION>, which averaged 159 billion gallons per day at <LOCATION> Massena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. That was 11 percent below normal for the St. Lawrence Water flows for the remainder of the nation's Big Five rivers in July were 75.4 billion gallons per day in the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dalles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, 58 percent below normal; 28.7 billion gallons a day in the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Hermann </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, 41 percent below normal; and 19.8 billion in the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, 38 percent below normal. In addition to the record at <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> as measured at <LOCATION> Keokuk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, also set a record low for July at 10.6 billion gallons a day, 74 percent below normal. Besides the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Edisto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> rivers, records for low July streamflows were set on: _ The <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, averaged 707 million gallons a day, 9 percent less than the record set in 1910 The flow was 65 percent below normal for the month. _ <LOCATION> Altahama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Doctortown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, was 74 percent below normal with a flow of 1.15 billion gallons per day, lowest in 56 years of records _ The <LOCATION> Apalachicola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Chattahoochee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, was the lowest in 59 years of recordkeeping, with an average of 3.8 billion gallons per day _ The <LOCATION> Sturgeon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Sidnaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, recorded a flow of only 5 million gallons per day, lowest in 47 years and 90 percent below normal _ <LOCATION> Oconto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, had its lowest July in 76 years, averaging 149 million gallons per day, 47 percent below normal

<HEAD>U.S. Embassy Says Report of Baby Trafficking is False, Slanderous</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday rejected as false and slanderous a report that babies were sold to Americans for adoption and then dismembered, with their hearts and livers going to organ banks. `` There does not exist the slightest evidence ... that any adopted infant from any part of the world has been used in that way,'' the embassy said in a statement. The statement followed news reports that police raiding a house last week found seven infants _ presumably born of <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> mothers _ and several pregnant women who apparently intended to give their babies up for adoption. The infants, aged three months to six months, were taken to a hospital. Police detained three men and a woman.

<HEAD>6-Year-Old With AIDS To Join Classmates, But Stay Behind Partition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has ordered school officials to build a glass-front isolation booth inside a classroom so a 6-year-old who has AIDS can be taught with other children. The box, to measure at least 6 feet by 8 feet, is to have a desk and a potty chair, a sound system and a full-time teacher's aide. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> said in her ruling Monday she took into consideration the concerns of all involved in the case brought by the girl's adoptive mother, <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, against the <ORGANIZATION> Hillsborough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> last September. The judge expressed hope that once <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> is able to see how her mentally handicapped schoolmates cope, she will become toilet-trained and learn not to habitually place her thumb and forefinger in her mouth. Once that happens, the `` remote theoretical possibility'' that acquired immune deficiency syndrome could be spread to her classmates will be so slight that she must be allowed to sit in the classroom with her peers, the judge ruled. No AIDS cases have been proven to have been transmitted through exposure to urine, feces or saliva even though the virus that causes the disease has been found in these bodily secretions, the judge wrote. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>'s lawyer, called the judge's ruling `` creative'' and said he hoped that within six weeks of starting school Aug. 29, <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> will have progressed enough to leave the booth. But a school official labeled the chamber idea `` sadistic,'' and compared it to child abuse. `` All I can do is see that little face in a bubble, very close to other children, but not able to take part in what the other children are doing,'' said <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Hillsborough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and a former teacher. `` I think I feel that this is as close to child abuse as it can be.'' <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Classroom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that teachers who are aware of the ruling have had `` basically a positive attitude, although slightly apprehensive.'' Of the judge's decision, he said: `` I think she broke new ground, but it's still a middle-of-the road ruling.'' Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> wanted her daughter schooled with other `` trainable mentally handicapped'' children at <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exceptional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, saying <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> needed the socialization and interaction. The school district wanted <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> taught at home out of fear she could transmit the AIDS virus. The girl has been in home instruction since June 1987. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Rampello </PERSON>, vice chairman of the school board, said, `` What the judge is asking us to do is unusual. But we're going to do it. I'm not criticizing; I'm not praising. We have to take all the good and all the problems that come with it, and all the consequences that come with it.'' <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> is one of 500 children in a pilot pediatric AIDS program who have been treated with experimental drugs including AZT. <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>'s case of AIDS, probably contracted from transfusions of contaminated blood after her premature birth in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, is being held in check by the treatment. <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> presided over the case brought by the three <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> brothers in <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION>, hemophiliacs who doctors believe were exposed to the virus through treatment with clotting agents from contaminated blood. She ordered the brothers admitted to regular classes last year, but after their house was burned, they moved with their family to another district.

 Church and temple bells tolled in <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> as thousands of people stopped in the streets Tuesday to remember the moment 43 years ago when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city. The city's mayor urged the government to clarify whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships are bringing nuclear weapons into <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. At 11:02 a.m., the moment when the bomb exploded in a burst of blinding light, bells tolled as many people on the streets and in shopping centers paused for a minute of silence. <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> became the target of the world's second atomic attack on Aug. 9, 1945. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dropped the first atomic bomb on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> three days earlier. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> surrendered about a week later to end World War II. At <LOCATION> Peace </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, near the point where the bomb exploded, about 20,000 people gathered for an annual service. Under a hot sun, people poured water over a memorial tablet to recall the cries of victims suffering from thirst and burns. Families presented a list of 2,295 names of bomb victims who died during the past year, bringing to 77,462 the number of post-war victims of nuclear radiation. Their names are inscribed on a vault near the park's peace statue. In the evening, about 2,000 Roman Catholics with candles walked through areas of the city once destroyed by the bombing, a church official said. Officials estimate up to 70,000 people died immediately from the explosion and the accompanying fire storms and radiation. About 70,000 residents still suffer from side effects of the plutonium bomb, doctors and social workers say. In the bombing of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, an estimated 70,000 to 140,000 people died. About 350,000 people in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> hold certificates showing they were victims of the atomic bombings in the two cities. Since the war <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has followed a policy of `` three non-nuclear principles'': no possession, manufacture or introduction into the country of nuclear weapons. Speaking at the ceremony in <LOCATION> Peace </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Hitoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Motoshima </PERSON> criticized his government for allowing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships to dock in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> without verifying whether they carry nuclear weapons. `` The Japanese government should independently check whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships are carrying nuclear weapons when they call on Japanese ports, and make clear that it still is observing the three non-nuclear principles,'' <PERSON> Motoshima </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> bombing destroyed almost everything within a radius of more than half a mile, including 1,326 buildings and homes. It also demolished 23,500 homes and buildings outside that radius, according to a report by the city. The ancient port city of 450,000, has been rebuilt, with modern office towers and tree-lined avenues replacing the rubble-strewn landscape.

<TEXT>
 A judge has given an Amish man two weeks to perform five hours of community service or face a charge of criminal contempt for refusing to display a slow-moving-vehicle sign on his horse-drawn buggy. The charge could mean a $ 700 fine or up to 90 days in jail. <ORGANIZATION> Fillmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s ruling Monday postponed action on a contempt charge stemming from <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershberger </PERSON>'s failure to pay a $ 20 fine. At an Aug. 29 hearing, <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said he would determine whether <PERSON> Hershberger </PERSON> performed the community service within the Amish community. `` There's no sense in getting into criminal contempt for non-payment of a $ 20 fine,'' the judge said. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law requires non-motorized vehicles to display an orange sign outlined in red at night, and to carry it at all times. The Amish, who contend that displaying the bright signs is against their religion, are allowed to use a black triangle outlined in white on their buggies and wagons during the daytime. Last year, another judge ruled that <PERSON> Hershberger </PERSON> violated a state law for not having the proper sign on his horse-drawn buggy. The judge stayed imposition of a $ 20 fine on condition that <PERSON> Hershberger </PERSON> not violate that law during the next six months. But <PERSON> Hershberger </PERSON> was arrested a second time and ordered to pay the fine. He refused. Prosecutors in April charged him with criminal contempt of court, a misdemeanor. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said he modified the original sentence to permit community service because that option had been available in other cases involving Amish defendants.

<HEAD>Survey: Nation's Teens At Risk During Troubled Adolescent Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The teen-age years are troubled times when many young people drink too much, eat badly, are prone to injury and violence and often consider suicide, according to a survey released Tuesday. The data confirmed what many parents and counselors have long known or suspected _ the adolescent years can be dangerous. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Windom </PERSON>, assistant health secretary and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, called the results `` somewhat dismaying.'' `` The results give us fresh insight concerning what our nation's teen-agers know and how they act concerning health and sex-related issues _ but they also show that too many young people, even when they know better, do n't always make the right health decisions,'' <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> said in a statement The survey, sponsored by health education groups and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, polled 11,000 eighth-graders and 10th-graders during the fall of 1987 from a nationally representative sample of 217 public and private schools. The margin of error was plus or minus 2 to 5 percentage points, depending on the frequency of the behavior reported, officials said. In one of the more startling findings, the study reported that 26 percent of the eighth-graders and 38 percent of the 10th-graders said they had had five or more drinks on one occasion during the two weeks preceding the survey. Also, 42 percent of the girls and 25 percent of the boys surveyed said they have `` seriously thought'' about committing suicide at some time in their lives. Nearly one in five girls and one in 10 boys of the total surveyed said they had actually tried to commit suicide. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Popham </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> IOX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted the survey, said it was possible some teen-agers exaggerated their responses but that the results were still `` frightening'' even if the figures were off by half. `` I do n't think they are off,'' he said. `` I really think a lot of kids in their modest way say it's not worth it. There's a consistent pattern of hopelessness, of depression'' in some of the responses. In the area of health, the survey indicated that most teens understand that acquired immune deficiency syndrome or AIDS is transmitted by sexual intercourse and drug needles. They also know that condoms are effective in helping avoid AIDS and believe they should be used. But about half of the students were unsure or mistakenly believed that washing after sex reduces the chances of being infected. The teens displayed ignorance about other sexually transmitted diseases. The survey noted that 2.5 million teen-agers are infected with such diseases each year and that many teens can not identify common early signs of the infections. A majority of those surveyed do not know that taking birth control pills is ineffective in avoiding these diseases. More than a third said they would not know where to go for medical care if they caught a sexually transmitted disease. The survey showed that many teens do n't eat right even when they know they should. Nearly four of every 10 students said they eat fried foods four or more times a week. The average student ate three snacks a day that were high in fat or sugar, and 73 percent said they knew that eating such food may be related to heart problems or high blood pressure. Sixty-one percent of the girls and 28 percent of the boys said they had dieted during the past year, and about half of the students who dieted used unsafe methods such as fasting. Others tried diet pills, laxatives or vomiting. Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death among people aged 15 to 25, with motor vehicle accidents accounting for more than 70 percent of accidental deaths. The survey showed that a substantial portion of teen-agers do not guard against such injuries. About 56 percent of those surveyed said they did not wear a seat belt the last time they rode in a vehicle. About 44 percent of 10th-graders and 32 percent of eighth-graders said they had ridden during the past month with a driver who had used drugs or alcohol. When they ride bicycles or motorcycles, according to the survey, 92 percent said they never wear a protective helmet. About half the boys and one-fourth of the girls reported having been involved in at least one fight during the year preceding the survey. Nearly one in five girls reported that during the past year while outside of school, someone tried to force them to have sex. About one-fourth of the boys said they have carried a knife to school at least once during the past year. Seven percent said they did so on a regular basis.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is prepared to provide logistical support to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force that will monitor a cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to take effect Aug. 20, the administration said Tuesday. Shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approved the establishment of the 350-member force, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said none of the 15 council members would contribute troops to the force, but `` we intend to be as helpful as we can.'' The force will be funded out of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping accounts through special assessments. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration welcomed the cease-fire announcement Monday by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and would bear `` its fair share of the cost'' of the observer force, including transportation and equipment. `` It is our understanding that there will be neither <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nor Soviet troops in the observer force,'' he added. `` It has been a major aim of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to bring this war to an end,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We now look forward to the implementation... in all its parts'' of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for such a cease-fire. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> expressed hope that the cease-fire would lead to rapid progress toward a final settlement and to the restoration of peace and security in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region. `` We strongly support the secretary general's call for both sides to exercise maximum military restraint until the cease-fire is in place,'' she said. The Iran-Iraq situation was the subject of a meeting late Monday involving Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> and an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> delegation headed by Saudi Foreign Minister <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Faisal </PERSON>. It was agreed by participants at the meeting that the `` states in the region have a vested interest in getting <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> back on their feet,'' said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, insisting on anonymity. Earlier Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will withdraw most of its naval forces from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> only when it is convinced that the cease-fire has taken effect. `` I would think we'd have to wait until the cease-fire actually takes hold, and probably after that a prudent period to make sure that it stays in effect,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' program. `` We have no desire to keep our ships, our people, there any longer than necessary. At the same time, we do n't want to put them in any danger,'' he said in a separate interview on `` CBS This Morning.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has maintained a force of close to 30 warships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to guard against attacks on oil tankers and other neutral shipping by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Since June 1987, many Kuwaiti tankers have carried <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags and been protected in convoys of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval ships. More recently, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was ordered to protect all neutral shipping that comes under attack in the gulf. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will probably maintain a presence of three to five ships in the region _ about what it has had there since the 1940s _ `` but that depends on the threat,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, meantime, chief spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had completed its 54th convoy operation of the year early Tuesday, with the guided-missile frigate <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> escorting the reflagged <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> tanker <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> up the gulf to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. `` The journey was uneventful and there was no unusual air or sea activity reported,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The spokesman said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had not received any reports of fighting Tuesday between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> either on land or water, but added: `` I do not have a definitive report that all hostilities have ceased. I ca n't speak to that one way or another.''

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gave credit Tuesday to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for making progress with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and asserted that he and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> are closer together on U.S.-Soviet issues than the president and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are. `` It's an administration that's growing,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Frankly, they're coming a lot closer to where I am.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee, offered qualified praise for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s conduct of relations with the Soviets, including nuclear arms talks. But he drew a distinction between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s foreign-policy positions and those of Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who next week will become the Republican presidential nominee. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ who a day earlier called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a `` stealth candidate'' who avoids tough issues _ had been unclear himself on many foreign policy questions. `` I do n't think <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s positions are clear on much of anything,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know. Do you know where he stands?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said to reporters. `` I do n't think anybody knows where he is on these things.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made his remarks to reporters aboard his campaign jet on a flight from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, where he joined his fellow governors for the final day of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> meeting. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke only briefly during discussions at the governors conference, and later met in private with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governors to discuss the fall campaign. He also visited a housing redevelopment project in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> to praise a resolution, passed unanimously by the governors, calling for the federal government to help states and cities expand the supply of affordable housing through housing grants and tax measures. The resolution calls for a $ 2.8 billion increase in federal spending for housing through a variety of programs that would provide rent subsidies and address what <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called `` the problem of home ownership for young families.'' `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> must be a part of the solution, and that's really what the governors have said today,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, on the flight to <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, was asked about a remark he made last week in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that it appeared `` peace is breaking out'' in various parts of the world. He was asked whether he gave credit to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He called `` terrific'' recent cease-fire agreements in the regional conflict in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and in the Iran-Iraq war, and gave credit to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for progress with the Soviets. `` The interesting thing is the president and I are closer together on U.S.-Soviet relations than he is with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The INF treaty -LRB- eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> -RRB- and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s approach to the summit demonstrate a willingness on his part to explore closer relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` It's to his credit.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also referred reporters to an interview published in Tuesday's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. In it he said, `` The president has spent two terms in office, has grown, his views have changed. I applaud him for it. I think one of the interesting questions that the vice president and I will be debating will be how it is that the president and I seem to be closer on this issue than he and the president.'' On the plane, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cited <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s description of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as an `` evil empire'' during his first term and credited him with moving away from that belief. `` Here's an administration that five years ago was talking evil empire and now the president is walking arm in arm with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in Red Square,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had critical words, however, for the administration's policies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes support for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels opposing that country's Sandinista government He said that was one issue on which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s position was clear and was `` on the wrong side.'' He called Central American `` the one regional conflict where we're missing an opportunity to work with people who want to work with us.''

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acting commander-in-chief, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, said Tuesday his nation is seeking a comprehensive peace but must remain vigilant in the face of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> `` mischief.'' He reflected the relieved but wary mood on the streets of the war-weary capital. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wo n't initiate any military actions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in light of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general setting Aug. 20 as the cease-fire date in the war. But he said that the soldiers should maintain their vigil against possible Iraqi attacks. `` The armed forces should not, from today, be the initiators of any kind of military and armed moves,'' said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who also is speaker of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament, in a statement read over <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` But just like always, -LRB- <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> -RRB- will be ready to give an appropriate response to the mischiefs of the enemy.'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s message said that the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> `` has decided to create a lasting and comprehensive peace in the region and will continue its path,'' but that it is faced `` with enemies whose claims, promises and agreements can not be trusted.'' He said the Iraqis `` might resort to any agression and crime during the few days left until the cease-fire date and even after that.'' `` Islamic <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is proud before God for performing its holy duty of protecting justice, and the Iraqi Baathists should answer God and the people as to why they kindled the fire of war and what tney gained from it,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said. In the streets of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, Iranians greeted the announcement of the cease-fire date in the 8-year-old Iraq-Iran war with a sense of relief mixed with skepticism that it will mean lasting peace. Most learned that the shooting is to stop only at 7 a.m., when the news came over <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. The announcement at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> came to late for the principal morning newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Jomhuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islami </ORGANIZATION>. `` Hopefully it means peace,'' said a hotel employee in the <LOCATION> Laleh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>, the former Intercontinental. `` But celebrating? After so many martyrs?'' Another English-speaking man who introduced himself as a telephone operator was smiling broadly. `` I just learned it 10 minutes ago. Sure, I will celebrate tonight with my family. I will have a bottle of coke. You know, there is no drinking in our country.'' In the sprawling bazaar, the mood was still depressed among some who lost heavily in speculating on a further rise of the free dollar rate against the rial. The dollar had dropped to almost one fourth of its value two months ago but seemed to have stabilized at about one third. `` But most businessmen here think that things will be better in a few months and that people's life will be much easier,'' one merchant said. A Western diplomat who declined to be identified said expectations have been running high among residents after <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accepted the cease-fire without precondition. `` They will be disappointed, normalization will take much time,'' he said. At a gas station where cars were filled up without having to wait, a man said, `` Let us hope that this will hold, that there will not be new fighting after two weeks.'' The reaction was much more subdued than in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, where people poured in the streets in the middle of the night to celebrate their `` victory'' and the government declared a three-day holiday. A French-speaker, who said he studied political science at <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> before he joined the communications services, said `` The Americans will come back now, I am sure. I do n't think it will take more than a few months.'' But on the 15-foot barbed-wire topped walls surrounding the vast grounds of the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, bold English and <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> writing painted years ago still boasted: `` We will make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> face a severe defeat.''

 <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ended talks Tuesday without reaching a compromise solution to a border dispute over <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>, a resort area on the <LOCATION> Aqaba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> claimed by both countries, officials said. `` There has been no agreement on any of the subjects discussed'' during the daylong talks, said <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Araby </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s delegation to an international arbitration body in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that is to settle the dispute over the 250-acre area No further talks are planned, and the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> delegation was scheduled to fly home later in the day, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured in its 1967 war with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, was not returned after the 1979 peace treaty. The two countries in 1986 agreed to accept a final decision on the territory by a five-member international panel in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The result of the arbitration is expected in September. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> mediated Tuesday's talks, held at a hotel near the <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> pyramids on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. The delegations in Tuesday's negotiations were led by <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s chief aide; <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s legal department; and <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, legal adviser to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. It was the fourth meeting between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> on the issue. A previous session, held in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in June, also failed to resolve the differences. Egyptian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> considers <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> part of its territory and hopes to win its case in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. In recent weeks, Egyptian officials, including President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, have emphasized that their country's sovereignty over <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> was not negotiable. <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> has a hotel and a tourist village, both Israeli-owned, and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has offered to buy them. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON>, in an Aug. 1 interview with <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, said that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should `` either divide the territory or make it a neutral zone and give both sides equal rights.'' <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> warned in an interview published Monday in the <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION> that if the Israeli side brought up such a suggestion during Tuesday's talks `` this would signal the end of the meeting.''

<TEXT>
 Nearly 7,000 Soviet troops have abandoned <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, which used to be <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, leaving the devastated provincial capital in the hands of Afghan forces, diplomats said Tuesday. Most of the 6,750 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops were evacuated from <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> by air Aug. 4-7, but a huge column of armor and heavy equipment continues to wind its way cautiously north through western <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, according to the reports. Western diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, quoting witnesses, said the last soldier _ an officer _ drove his jeep up to a waiting Ilyushin-76 transport plane, walked up the ramp then tossed his keys back in the seat for the Afghans to drive away. <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>'s population of 200,000 has dwindled to 20,000 in the 10 years of war, according to Western estimates. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s Marxist government recently admitted that nearly 70 percent of the city's buildings has `` been damaged or razed to the ground.'' If <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> sticks to the withdrawal timetable set forth in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord signed in April, half of its more than 100,000 troops should be out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Aug. 15. Western diplomats, quoting dispatches from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> has been left to 3,000 `` young and apprehensive'' Afghan troops to face continuing rocket and ground attacks by determined Moslem guerrillas. The <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government has invited 50 foreign correspondents to the capital to witness the ceremonial withdrawal of the first Kabul-based Soviet units. It marks the Aug. 15 halfway point of a total pullout from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to be completed by Feb. 15. Diplomats said the two departing 500-man, 100-vehicle units are just a fraction of the 20,000 Soviet troops believed to be defending the heavily fortified city. Large units of Soviet and Afghan troops moved west into the <LOCATION> Paghman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> plains </LOCATION> last week to dislodge 4,000 <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> insurgents who threatened to disrupt the Aug. 4-7 visit of Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and the Aug. 15 pullout ceremonies, diplomats said. Heavy fighting has cost about 100 lives on each side, according to their estimates. Security was so tight during <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s stay that upon his departure, his Tu-154 plane was protected by eight Mi-24 helicopter gunships, plus jets above the cloud cover, all dropping clusters of flares to ward off any guerrilla anti-aircraft missiles. Witnesses said the plane corkscrewed eight times skyward in a steep climb before it reached a safe altitude to set a bearing for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Western diplomatic sources said they believed his visit was to reassure Afghan communists of the Kremlin's continued support and to report on his talks with <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sahabzada </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, whose country backs the guerrillas with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s help Western, Pakistani and guerrilla sources predict <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s communist regime will fall quickly in the absence of Soviet military might

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today announced he is nominating <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> to be secretary of education, marking the first time a Hispanic has ever been named to the Cabinet. ` This is a proud day ... for all Americans,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in announcing the selection of <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> to succeed Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who had announced earlier this year that he would not serve throughout the remainder of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term. `` It's hard right at this moment to think of a more exciting moment,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who appeared in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> briefing room with <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, 61. Asked whether he had selected <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> because of his heritage, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I did n't even ask him that.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he selected <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> because he was `` the best-fitted man to succeed'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> last July 6, had pledged to name a Hispanic to the Cabinet if he were elected to succeed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Asked today if he had allowed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to influence the decision, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, `` No, I'm just still working at the job here.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he was ready to turn over to <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> `` the apple, the pencil and the key'' to the Cabinet officer's door. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> `` a distinguished educator.'' `` With his administrative skills and his many accomplishments in the field of education, Dr. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> is an ideal selection for this Cabinet post,'' the president said. `` His commitment to the profession of teaching and to excellence in education and his belief in getting back to basics and things like homework, and above all his emphasis on education of special importance to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s minorities, are messages I hope he will sound far and wide across the nation,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` This job has had its thrills during the past 91 months, and not a few of those experiences I've shared with you in this room,'' he said. `` But it's hard right now to think of a more exciting moment than this one, and the knowledge that Dr. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> will be the first Hispanic-American member of the Cabinet,'' he said. `` That says a lot about him and about Americans of Hispanic heritage. It also says something about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as a place of opportunity and hope,'' he said. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> is a native of south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the son of a foreman of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gertrudis </LOCATION> Division of the huge King Ranch. He has served as president of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> since 1980 while also heading the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. He was the first <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> graduate and first Hispanic to hold those two posts. Previously, he was a member of the faculty of <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> as professor of anatomy and earlier had taught at the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also used the occasion to pay tribute to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, calling the departing <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary the `` best thing to happen'' to American education. In early May, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he would resign in September to return to private life. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> made headlines throughout his tenure with acerbic criticisms of teacher unions, school bureaucracy, colleges raising tuitions twice as fast as inflation, and the `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> math and back-of-the-bus science'' meted out to black children in ghetto schools. He called <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s schools the nation's worst and said that system was in an `` educational meltdown.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Tuesday celebrated the birth of a princess with two 41-gun salutes, a new cocktail and heavy betting on her name. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, saying it was `` wonderful'' to be a father, showered the women in his life with roses and carnations _ reportedly choosing red for his red-haired wife, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, and pink for his day-old daughter, the couple's first child and the fifth grandchild of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. The daughter of the <ORGANIZATION> Duchess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> is a beautiful baby with elegant hands and `` a petite little face ... just fit for a princess,'' said the duchess' sister, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Makim </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and received a phone call from her mother, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrantes </PERSON>, after the birth. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, fielding questions from reporters outside <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> on Tuesday, said she probably looked like `` both of us.'' Asked whether she was pretty, he replied: `` Yes, but I am biased.'' Dr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>, the obstetrician who supervised the Monday night delivery, said: `` I'm delighted it all went so well. All I can say is that it was a normal birth. Both of them are doing very well.'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> said: `` It was a long time, but she came through it very, very well.'' Told that he looked worried while waiting for the birth, which he attended, the prince retorted: `` That's because I was on my way to the dentist.'' Buckingham Palace said the 28-year-old duchess is expected to remain in the hospital for a few days. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> insisted that no name has been chosen for the new princess, who is fifth in line to the throne behind the queen's eldest son, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, his children, Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> himself `` We have a few ideas but we have n't chosen a name yet,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, also 28. British gamblers had a few ideas as well. `` We've been extremely busy today,'' said <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyrah </PERSON> of Coral Bookmakers. `` There's been plenty of interest in the baby's name. The one name that everyone seems to want to bet in the last few hours is <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, which has seen the odds tumble from 14-1 to 6-4 favorite. I hope that does n't mean that everyone knows before us. `` The second favorite is <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> at 5-2 followed by two very popular names, <PERSON> Annabel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, at 4-1,'' he said. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> had mentioned a preference for <PERSON> Annabel </PERSON> in May. Cards and bouquets poured into the hospital and hundreds of people stopped at Buckingham Palace to read the official announcement on the gate. Two army units fired simultaneous 41-gun salutes in <LOCATION> Hyde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and at Tower Green near the Tower of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to celebrate the princess' arrival. In the town of <LOCATION> Dummer </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, where the former <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> grew up, villagers at The Queen Inn pub toasted mother and baby with a special cocktail called the `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' _ made from <LOCATION> Babycham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Grenadine </LOCATION> and navy rum. A nursery has been prepared at the couple's temporary home at <ORGANIZATION> Castlewood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a 12-bedroom mansion near <LOCATION> Egham </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, that King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> loaned them while their own home is being built at nearby <LOCATION> Sunninghill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. The duchess' full-time nurse, <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Wardley </PERSON>, 21, will be the youngest nanny in the royal family. `` I am just waiting to hear now when I will start,'' she told reporters at her home in the city of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>. `` I was very excited and very thrilled when I heard the news. It has been a long wait.'' The Princess of <PERSON> York </PERSON> was born on the eighth day of the eighth month of 1988 at 8:18 p.m.. She weighed in at six pounds, 12 ounces The day is considered the luckiest of the century by the Chinese, whose word for eight is similar to that for prosperity. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> press decided it was an auspicious day as well for the first princess in the royal family since the queen's only daughter, Princess <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, was born in 1950. The Times' front-page headline said: `` At 8:18 on 8.8.88 _ A Safe and Lucky Royal Birth.'' The tabloid Sun, said: `` Fergie's first baby has been blessed with the century's luckiest birthday. The Sun said she would be the first royal bride of the 21st century and listed six contenders `` for the tiny tot's hand,'' including <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Soames </PERSON>, the 3-year-old great-grandson of Sir <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>, the 3-year-old son of rock star <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>.

 A federal judge who was chastised by a higher court for showing bias in favor of <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klansmen </PERSON> in a race violence case has offered to ban himself from litigation involving the federal government. But so far, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 60, has not drawn any public call for such blanket disqualification. <PERSON> Acker </PERSON>, appointed to the bench by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1982, scheduled a hearing on the issue for Friday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> on Tuesday filed a response on behalf of the government in which he said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` has at this time insufficient information to determine and no reason to believe that Judge <PERSON> Acker </PERSON>'s proposed general recusal is either necessary or appropriate.'' <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, who said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will not be represented at the hearing, said it is the government's view `` that the matter of recusal is better left for consideration on a case-by-case basis.'' <PERSON> Acker </PERSON>'s rulings against the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in the Klan litigation prompted the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to remove him from the case in a bluntly worded order. `` During the course of this litigation,'' wrote 11th Circuit Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, `` Judge <PERSON> Acker </PERSON>'s position has become hardened against the government, and he has evidenced a commitment that clearly reflects that he is no longer able to view these cases impartially.'' <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> had ruled that the actions of several Klansmen, accused of violating the civil rights of marchers in a violent confrontation at <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> in 1979, did not justify what <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> said were improper tactics used by the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poverty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> branded `` a counter-vigilante group.'' The center had sued the Klansmen, then gave their testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which used it to obtain indictments against them. <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> ruled the testimony inadmissible evidence and then did not follow 11th Circuit instructions to admit it as evidence. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Dees </PERSON>, director of the center, said his organization would take no position on <PERSON> Acker </PERSON>'s qualifications to preside over government cases. <PERSON> Dees </PERSON>, whose center over nearly two decades has handled a number of highly publicized civil rights and death penalty cases, said center attorneys will not attend Friday's hearing. `` We've never had any experience with Judge <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> in any other case,'' <PERSON> Dees </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomany </PERSON>, one of the attorneys for the Klansmen, said he plans to attend the hearing `` to submit any kind of briefs in support'' of the judge. `` I think he is a good and fair judge and he's ruled against our clients and against the government on occasion. More often than not, he's ruled against our clients. All in all, he's been impartial,'' said <PERSON> Gomany </PERSON>. `` This court is neither seeking praise nor condemnation,'' <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> wrote in June when he scheduled the hearing, `` but feels it is necessary that it create a forum for frank and serious discussion of a very serious subject, namely: ` Should a judge whose position is hardened against the government sit on the government's cases?''' <PERSON> Acker </PERSON>'s clerk said she was not aware of any briefs filed in advance of the hearing. The controversy began in 1979 in <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, when a march by the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> ended in a bloody confrontation with <PERSON> Klansmen </PERSON>, who beat police with clubs when officers tried to keep them away from the marchers. Shots were exchanged and several people were injured, none fatally. An initial <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation ended without indictments. But the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poverty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> filed a civil action against 50 <ORGANIZATION> Klansmen </ORGANIZATION>, seeking financial damages and bans on Klan actions. The center took testimony from <LOCATION> Klansmen </LOCATION>, then made it available to federal investigators, who used it to obtain indictments against nine Klansmen in 1984. <PERSON> Acker </PERSON>, however, blocked the testimony, saying it was inadmissible in the government's case. <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> said the Klan is `` a vigilante group which undoubtedly, from time to time, violates the constitutional rights of citizens.'' `` However, one vigilante group does not justify the creation and operation of -LRB- a -RRB- counter-vigilante group in violation of the constitutional rights of the first group.'' `` To tolerate a rape of the rights of the Klan would be a recognition that some sort of double standard exists for the application of constitutional protections,'' he said. The government appealed and the 11th Circuit ruled that the testimony should not be suppressed. The 11th Circuit ordered <PERSON> Acker </PERSON>'s removal from the case when the government filed a second appeal, arguing that he had failed to follow the circuit court's directions.

<HEAD>Most Doctors Don't Test for AIDS Before Artificial Insemination</HEAD>

 Only 44 percent of the nation's 11,000 physicians who perform artificial insemination test the donated semen for the AIDS virus, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> study released Tuesday. The study said that about 65,000 babies conceived by artificial insemination were born in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year. Semen for more than 30,000 of those babies was provided by anonymous sperm donors, the report by the congressional agency said. In a survey of 367 doctors who have at least four artificial insemination patients a year, only 44 percent, or about 161, said they test donors for evidence of the AIDS virus, the report said. Some doctors, however, reject semen if the donor is considered at risk of being infected with AIDS. Of the doctors surveyed, 16 percent said they rejected donors due to homosexual contacts; 13 percent for intravenous drug use; 12 percent for multiple heterosexual contacts; and 6 percent just for residency in an area where AIDS is common. Homosexuality, promiscuous sexual contact and IV drug use are all considered risk factors for contracting acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The study said 28 percent of the surveyed doctors tested sperm donors for syphilis; 27 percent for gonorrhea; 26 percent for hepatitis; 23 percent for chlamydia; and 6 percent for herpes. Fifteen surveyed sperm banks, which collect and store semen for use under the direction of doctors, said they screen donor semen for AIDS, although one sperm bank said the test was performed `` only if the donor were considered to be from a high risk group.'' There have been no confirmed reports of women infected with AIDS from donated semen, but in two locations semen from men later found to have AIDS has been used for artificial insemination, the report said. In <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austrialia </LOCATION>, the study says, there have been several women who were exposed to AIDS from insemination of infected semen. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> recommended last February that all donated semen be frozen and quarantined for at least six months. This would enable the semen donors to be tested for AIDS, a disease that may not show up in blood tests for months after the sperm is infective. The <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> study, however, showed that 22 percent of the surveyed physicians used only fresh semen, usually from the husband or partner of the woman. Of the frozen semen used, 75 percent had a quarantine period, generally of three months, the report said. In general, the report said, commercial sperm banks were more likely to screen donors effectively for infertility, AIDS and genetic defects than were individual physicians. About 20 percent of the women requesting artificial insemination are turned down by the physicians, the study said. Over half the doctors said they reject unmarried women or those whom they consider psychologically immature. Almost all of the doctors said they were willing to match the woman's specifications for donor's race, eye color and body type, and a majority also would match specifications for educational attainment, intelligence quotient and religion. Artificial insemination is a procedure whereby sperm is inserted into the vagina or uterus by syringe or other artificial means. The technique is commonly used for women whose husbands are sterile or whose husbands' semen requires processing to enhance the chances of conception. Unmarried women also request artificial insemination, the report said. AIDS is caused by a virus that can be transmitted through blood products or sperm. AIDS kills by attacking the victims' immune system, making them susceptible to disease and some types of cancer. There have been no known cases of full recovery from AIDS infection.

<HEAD>U.S. Officials, Back From Moscow, See No Sign Of Soviet Military
Reduction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials saw no signs during last week's trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> of a reduction in Soviet military forces or spending, despite Soviet assurances of a new defense policy, an American official said Monday. The official, who accompanied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> on the trip but who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, `` It does not seem to us evident yet that there is any change in force structure or resources that the Soviets are committing to their military effort.'' The official was in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> to brief the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s four days of talks with Soviet Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> and unprecedented tours of secret Soviet military bases. The council, the highest decision-making body of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, is made up of representatives of the 16 countries in the alliance. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official told reporters the Americans discussed the Soviets' so-called defensive doctrine, under which emphasis would be placed on defending territory rather than seizing or holding it. `` When we look at their forces,'' he said, `` the things that bother us for example is their heavy emphasis'' on tanks, artillery, engineer bridging units and airborne forces. He said these are the type of troops that would be used to grab territory. `` Now,'' he said, `` the Soviets say they are changing to a defensive doctrine and they do n't have that objective. ... We made clear to them that we must pay attention specifically to what their capabilities are.'' `` We would welcome seeing changes ... away from those kinds of forces that would help us relieve our concerns about the offensive capabilities of the Soviet army,'' he said. He did say, however, that Soviet officials provided some evidence that military exercises `` seem to be shifting ... to reflect'' the new doctrine. `` We do n't dismiss the utility of that or changes of that kind on the Soviet side,'' he said. Soviet authorities also told their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> counterparts they were putting together a better accounting of their defense spending, the official said. `` We do n't have anything concrete as to whether or not they are in fact applying less resources to the military or not right now,'' he said. `` We do n't see evidence of that in terms of what you can see in their own production output and other efforts.'' He said Soviet officials did not dispute <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimates that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> spends 15 percent to 17 percent of its economic output on the military. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense spending amounts to about 6 percent of the gross national product, the total value of goods and services produced by the economy. The official said the two delegations also discussed ways to prevent accidental shootings or other serious incidents between the two countries' forces during peacetime. In 1985, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military observer was shot and killed in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> while making what <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> authorities said was a proper tour of the area. The first meeting of a working group on preventing such incidents was scheduled to meet in the fall, the official said. No date or place has yet been set. This was the third meeting between <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>. They met last March in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and again at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit in June. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not expecting dramatic changes in its military ties with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` It would be, I think, unfounded to anticipate a sea change in our relationships with them in the military area,'' he said. `` These discussions in and of themselves, do not change the security situation that we have to face. ... We find no grounds in these contacts we have had for unilaterally altering our military structure or our defense posture or the need for readiness or defense spending.''

<TEXT>
 A Moslem leader appealed to wealthy <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states Tuesday for emergency help for millions of victims of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s worst floods in 42 years. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s state-run television showed helicopter views of the capital city of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kassala </LOCATION> and other badly hit areas in neighboring <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, with villages turned into islands and people slogging through knee-deep water. The floods, brought on by torrential rains last week, left millions of people stranded in eastern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, cut off from relief supplies by the rising waters, authorities said. At least 11 Sudanese have died and more than 1 million were left homeless by floods, Finance Minister <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nour </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Dayem </PERSON> said in reports carried by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. He said 5,000 houses were destroyed in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> alone. The news agency said at least 40,000 houses in all were destroyed. The government declared the cities of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kassala </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Showak </PERSON> and el-Damer disaster areas and on Monday night announced a nationwide six-month state of emergency. The news agency reported an appeal by <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Gad </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Haq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aly </PERSON> <PERSON> Gad </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Haq </PERSON>, leader of <ORGANIZATION> Al-Azhar </ORGANIZATION> religious institution, for help from the Islamic world, `` especially from the wealthy Moslems.'' <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> are among <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s main economic backers, having provided it with oil and loans. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Azhar </ORGANIZATION> is considered Islam's highest seat of learning. On its Arabic-language newscast, <ORGANIZATION> Egypt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> said water had reached up to 6 -LCB- feet but was receding. Earlier Tuesday, the Sudanese ambassador to <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, Omer el-Sheikh said more than 10,000 houses were demolished. Electricity and water remained cut off from <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> for the third straight day, <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s leading newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION> and another state-run daily, <ORGANIZATION> Al-Gomhouria </ORGANIZATION> said some of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>'s 4 million inhabitants faced starvation after the power failure disrupted bakeries and food supplies began dwindling. International help began pouring in after <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> appealed for help Sunday. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> sent 10 C-130 military transport planes carrying tents, medical supplies and food. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> flew in blankets, tents and medicine Sunday night and probably will send in more aid this week. The French medical humanitarian group <ORGANIZATION> Medicins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frontieres </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Doctors Without Borders -RRB- said Tuesday it would send emergency aid teams at <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s request and also planned to send 35 tons of medical supplies, drinking water, four-wheel drive vehicles and tents. In <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, telephone and telex operators said all lines to <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> had been down for two days. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, along with most of central <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, had been suffering from years of drought. Drought and a 5-year-old civil war in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> have created widespread famine since 1985, forcing hundreds of thousands of southerners to trek north to <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> and southeast into neighboring <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. Ambassador el-Sheikh said it will be difficult to get relief supplies to victims because of flooded roads. He foresaw further hardship in that the month of August `` is expected to be a rainy season.'' He expressed fear of a possible outbreak of epidemics. Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> said in announcing a state of emergency that it would help his government cope with flood destruction. A previous state of emergency began last year and ended two weeks ago. It was meant to counter the effects of southern rebels and gave authorities wide-ranging powers.

<HEAD>Union Says Social Security May Be Shortchanging Some Retirees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Up to one-third of all recent retirees may be getting substantially shortchanged on their Social Security checks because of discrepancies in government records, a union representing federal workers said Tuesday. A recently announced plan by the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to correct the records `` is a cruel hoax and a charade,'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaylock </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, told two <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> subcommittees. The union represents 700,000 workers, including 60,000 at the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Government auditors agreed that the chances of clearing up discrepancies of past years look bleak. However, the IRS-Social Security agreement `` should result in more employees' Social Security-covered earnings being properly reported to and recorded by <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Delfico </PERSON>, senior associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Blaylock </PERSON>'s account of the extent of the records problem was considerably worse than estimates by <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> auditors. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, estimated the problem could cost about 10 million beneficiaries an average of $ 17 a month. The union put the number of affected retirees as high as 40 million and estimated the loss at up to $ 50 a month. The problem grows out of the dual reporting of employee earnings by employers, once a year to the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and once a quarter to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. For a variety of reasons, those reports do not always match. Between 1978 and 1984, employers reported $ 58.8 billion less to Social Security than they did to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. As a result, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has turned over to Social Security trust funds more than $ 7.7 billion in payroll taxes that are not credited to the account of any worker and, thus, can not be paid in benefits. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and Social Security headquarters announced a plan last month for preventing such discrepancies in the future and for attempting to clear up the 10-year backlog of errors. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> surveyed what <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> had done to correct 3.5 million employer reports that make up the 1978-83 backlog and found that as of June 10, `` most of the differences in employer reports to the two agencies have not been resolved and likely will not be.'' `` Most employers <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> contacted either have not responded, are no longer in business or no longer have the necessary records,'' <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Delfico </PERSON> told the subcommittees Another 2.1 million employer reports for 1984 through 1986 are being checked as well. <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Preserve Social Security and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, told the subcommittee that <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> is giving up too easily on many employers that are responsible for the backlog of earlier years. `` SSA now claims that is has ` resolved' almost all of the 3.5 million cases of missing or discrepant employer wage reports that accumulated between 1978 and 1983,'' <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said. `` What <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> means, however, is that it considers these cases closed. `` Unfortunately, for hundreds of thousands of these cases, the agency made no effort to correct the records because the amount involved was, in its view, ` too small','' <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, chief financial officer of <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION>, urged workers to use a new government form to make sure that their own Social Security earnings records are correct. The form, SSA-7004, is available in Social Security offices or by calling 1-800-937-2000.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, spurred by fears about sludge and medical waste washing onto East Coat beaches, voted 97-0 on Tuesday passage of a bill which bans the dumping of sludge in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. The action sends the measure to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where a similar bill is on the floor awaiting final action. The bill bans the dumping of municipal sludge off the coasts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> after 1991 and orders the closing of a sludge dump site 106 miles off the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> coast. That location is the only site where sludge currently can be legally dumped. The site is used by six sewage authorities in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and three in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, including the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Before approving the bill, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> added an amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., which bans the disposal of all medical waste in oceans or streams It also approved another amendment, by Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, providing a five-year prison sentence for anyone caught violating that ban. Both amendments were approved by voice vote without any audible dissent. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> told his colleagues that because of medical waste washing up on his state's beaches, `` last week, virtually every <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> beach was shut down because of medical waste during one of the hottest spells in the state's history.'' `` We're moving closer to the day when we'll stop using the ocean as a sewer,'' said <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, one of the co-sponsors. `` Sludge dumping is a throwaway approach to our waste problem and contributes to the overall ocean pollution problem.'' Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, agreed. `` We're treating the oceans as a cesspool,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> first ordered an end to the ocean dumping of sewage sludge in 1972. Five years laters, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> directed that the dumping be ended by 1981. But the nine municipalities in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> successfully sued in federal court to ignore that deadline. `` We need a firm deadline, in the law, to ban the ocean dumping of sewage sludge,'' said <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>. `` Only then will alternatives be put in place. Only then will the dumping stop.''

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> slipped to a seven-point lead over Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a Gallup poll released Tuesday, relinquishing the boost in support he gained from the Democratic National Convention. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> received 49 percent backing in the survey of 1,004 registered voters, compared to 42 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The national poll, conducted Friday through Sunday, had a three-point margin of error. A Gallup poll two weeks ago, just after the convention, gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a 17-point lead, and he maintained that lead in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll done July 31-Aug. 3 Before the convention, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led by six. Poll analysts have characterized the double-digit <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lead as a temporary bounce created by news coverage of the Democratic convention, and said they expected <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to recover the ground as the race progressed. `` It was just a question of when it would happen,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugick </PERSON>, political poll chief for Gallup. `` It has happened.'' Next, he said, if history is a guide, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should draw even with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> after the GOP convention. Analysts affiliated with both parties reacted cautiously to the suggestion <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lead may have slipped even before the Republicans' convention next week. `` I expect fluctuations back and forth. Those things do n't surprise me right now,'' said <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> `` Tubby'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign pollster `` I'm not paying a lot of attention to the ups and downs in polls.'' `` It's interesting because it's the first poll showing movement in that direction,'' said <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrance </PERSON>, a leading Republican pollster. `` But it needs to be confirmed by at least one or two other national polls.'' <PERSON> Torrance </PERSON> hypothesized that the finding could simply reflect public interest in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s impending selection of a running mate. `` We can conjecture that some of the vice presidential naming game has advanced the normal convention bounce ahead of time,'' he said. `` There's been no spectacular event that could have caused this.'' <PERSON> Torrance </PERSON> said the question is whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> simply rebounded early, or the Republican convention will propel him to an even closer race. Measuring from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' big post-convention lead, he said, `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has to get seven points back just to be 10 points down. To go into Labor Day 10 points down still gives you a relatively formidable task.'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, similarly, said the polls will take on greater significance after Labor Day, when voters begin to know the candidates better and to focus more on the issues. In that vein, he said, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' early lead meant little. `` These are not men, even yet, about whom the public knows a great deal,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. `` There's a different national poll out every day. It's subject to great discussion. But I've found in the past it does n't make much sense.''

 A top <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Tuesday the absence of progress toward an internal political settlement in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> could block final agreement on the withdrawal of all foreign forces from that country. While expressing optimism based on recent recent talks among outside parties, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> said the unresolved civil war in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> `` could hamper and postone'' efforts to reach a troop withdrawal agreement. <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> spoke as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> prepared to begin a three-week pullout of its troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> on Wednesday under terms of a cease-fire reached with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The accord, in which <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> has served as mediator, also sets a Nov. 1 starting date for a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan to grant independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from South African colonial rule. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government has been fighting anti-communist guerrillas for the past 13 years. That issue is not formally on agenda for the series of talks that began in May involving <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The main purpose of the talks has been the withdrawal of foreign forces. The parties next will attempt to reach agreement on a timetable for the withdrawal of the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has linked its withdrawal plan to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s consent to an early pullout of its troops `` It would be tragic if this moment is not seized to bring peace to Angolans themselves as well as bringing peace to southwestern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the sense of ending the cross border conflict,'' <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> told a news conference. He said it would mean continued Soviet military support for the Angolan government and continued American backing for the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels. The absence of progress toward an internal settlement in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, he added, would have a `` direct bearing'' on the willingness of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to compromise on the troop withdrawal question. <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> said he has made it clear to the parties that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not look on its support for <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> as `` something to be traded as a bargaining chip'' in the negotiations on <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been providing the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels with about $ 15 million in assistance annually. <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> said the Soviets, meanwhile, have been sending about $ 1 billion a year in military aid to their Angolan ally. The administration has strongly supported the concept of national reconciliation talks between <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and the Angolan government. But Angolan authorities thus far have maintained that the best solution is for the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> forces to surrender their arms and take part in a national reconstruction effort.

<HEAD>Belfast Quiet After Violent Night On Internment Anniversary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gangs of Roman Catholics set street bonfires and threw rocks, bottles and firebombs at security patrols early Tuesday after two Catholics were killed, apparently by Protestant extremists. The sporadic rioting in Catholic areas that began Monday night also marked the 17th anniversary of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s abandoned policy of detaining suspected guerrillas without trial. Police believe the two Catholics slain Monday were killed in reprisal for attacks last week by guerrillas of the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that killed six people and wounded 37. A spokesman at <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>'s police headquarters said no violence was reported during the day Tuesday. Police said security forces came under 83 separate attacks during the overnight fighting, but the spokesman said fewer than 500 people probably were involved in the clashes that occurred throughout the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province. Officials reported eight policemen were hurt, none seriously, and four of 12 civilians injured were hospitalized. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> and its supporters continue to commemorate the introduction of the internment law on Aug. 9, 1971, even though it was abandoned amid worldwide criticism in 1975. Officials said police and soldiers were attacked with bombs, rocks, bottles and bricks and the patrols responded by firing plastic bullets. Some shots were fired at police, the officials said, but they did not report any gunshot casualties and said at one point security forces fired live ammunition into the air to disperse rioters. Eleven people, including two teen-age girls, were freed on bail by courts after being charged with riotous behavior. An 18-year-old man from <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> was charged with throwing a gasoline bomb and assaulting police and remained in jail. Some bonfires flamed out of control and damaged buildings, including a Baptist church, before the night's violence subsided with demonstrators making their traditional protest of banging garbage can lids. The two men killed Monday were <PERSON> Seamus </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, 17, shot to death on a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> street, and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>, 25, a beer-truck deliveryman slain when he tried to block the gunmen's getaway. Their deaths raised the known death toll to 2,675 from the sectarian violence that began in 1969. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON>, president of the Methodist church in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, called for the determined pursuit of `` mindless murderers'' who cross the border to take refuge in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. He spoke at the funeral of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassard </PERSON>, 60, one of two construction men shot to death last Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> terrorists because they were working at a police station at the border town of <LOCATION> Belleek </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> seeks to unite <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, where Protestants outnumber Catholics 3-2, with the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Democrats Say Reagan Deregulation Efforts Went Too Far</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Democratic leaders accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration Tuesday of allowing its efforts to deregulate the economy to go so far that the safety of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> consumers is being threatened. In a report released the week before the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, the Democrats accused the administration of lax enforcement of laws, inadequate staffing and financing of regulatory agencies, and a failure to oversee industry aggressively. The study cited problems with the airline, railroad, banking and maritime industries as well with children's products, food and workplace safety, the environment, drug abuse and fire safety. `` We are at greater risk today when we eat, travel, go the beach, drink water, deposit money in the bank or buy toys for our children than we were seven and a half years ago,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., who oversaw the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Safety that produced the study Among the report's conclusions were that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has not sufficiently financed the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, kept up with expansion of the airline industry or actively enforced consumer protection laws. `` Our society has paid an enormous price for this administration's ideological attempts to undo a century's worth of consumer protection,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic whip. At their news conference on the report, Democrats released a statement from <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, their party's presidential candidate, who pledged that if elected he would `` restore to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s families the safety and protection they deserve.'' Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> criticized the study. `` The highly partisan attack today by members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Safety was full of inaccuracies and distortions,'' he said in a written response. He blamed congressional Democrats for not providing adequate budgets for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> specialists will help investigate the bombing of the motorcade carrying Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. A leftist guerrilla group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bolivar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commando </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the Monday explosion, which investigators said they believed was intended to frighten rather than kill. Three cars were damaged but no one was injured. <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said drug traffickers probably were behind the attack. `` In terms of the way it was done, and the amount of explosives that were used, it ... probably came from narcotics dealers who are protesting the vigorous legislation and action the <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> government is taking,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> told reporters during a visit to <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> had no specific warnings of an attack on <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, but `` there was a lot of security down there.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION> on Tuesday, with a stop in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, to meet with former President <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON>. Police said the bomb consisted of several sticks of dynamite buried by the roadside and connected to a detonator by more than 40 yards of cable. The explosion hurled rocks and chunks of pavement at cars in the motorcade, only four of which were armored. One of those damaged was the armored car carrying <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>. Callers to local news agencies, purporting to speak for the <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolivar </PERSON> <PERSON> Commando </PERSON>, described the group as `` anti-imperialist and indigenous.'' They also claimed responsibility in its name for a bombing earlier this year at the home of the La Paz jail warden and an explosion during a visit by King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in April 1987. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Bolivian investigators said they had information on the group and believe it is responsible for bank robberies and bombings. Other anonymous callers claimed responsibility on behalf of a group called the <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilca </PERSON>, but police discounted the claim. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> has had few instances of political violence in recent years. The few bombings reported generally have caused no injuries. Labor and left-wing political groups had condemned the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> visit as interference in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. Farmers and labor have criticized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid in fighting the drug trade and reducing the coca leaf crop because it threatens the livelihoods of nearly 350,000 farmers who grow coca, the raw material for cocaine. A Bolivian law that took effect two weeks ago would phase out production on 90 percent of coca plantations and impose stiff penalties on cocaine producers and traffickers. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has 40 military trainers, drug enforcement and border patrol agents working with <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> police in the anti-drug campaign.

<HEAD>House Approves $3.9 Billion Drought Relief Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 3.9 billion aid package for drought-stricken farmers Tuesday and sent the measure to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who made known he intends to sign it. `` We have kept the faith,'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the bill, 383-18. `` To all who will be helped by this legislation, our promise has been kept.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> devoted only brief debate to the measure, which emerged from a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> last week and won <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval on Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> raced to put the legislation on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s desk before it begins a three-week break Friday. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters hours earlier there was no doubt that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will sign the measure. Provisions call for government payments to farmers who have lost more than 35 percent of their crops because of drought, hail, excessive moisture or related damage, such as that caused by insects. The payments would be equal to 65 percent of their losses over the 35 percent threshhold level. Additional payments would be available for the farmers hardest hit by the blazing sun and lack of rainfall that have darkened fields in the midcontinent. Farmers who have received government income-support payments in advance would not have to repay them in many cases under the legislation. Those receiving payments would be required to purchase federal crop insurance for their 1989 crops. The measure would make feed assistance available for producers of many varieties of livestock, including cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, poultry, horses used for food or in food production and fish used for food. Bills involving major farm subsidies have come in for substantial criticism on fiscal grounds from urban lawmakers in recent years. But the drought measure escaped such complaints for the most part. Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, R-Pa., did complain about a $ 5.5 million authorization contained in the measure for a temperature control system on the <LOCATION> Sacremento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Shasta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to aid salmon spawning `` So the bill is going to take care of yuppies, too, and make sure their salmon mousse supply is not interfered with?'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. He grumbled that the public is `` sick and tired of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> using every sort of emergency to pork barrel.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> replied that the drought could be even worse in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> next year than it is now. The legislation is a bipartisan product that was produced in record time _ about six weeks _ with lawmakers hurrying to finish their work and win the president's approval before any second thoughts about the expense set in or the bill accumulated so many special-interest provisions that it would be impossible to pass. `` This bill is the product of a tremendous concerted effort to produce relief for drought-stricken farmers,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Lawmakers and the administration believe the measure can be paid for with funds that the government will save because of the drought. Income-support payments, known to farmers as deficiency payments, increase in proportion to the size of the producer's crop yield. The drought has reduced these yields and thus slashed the amount that the government will be required to spend. By some estimates, the savings could be as much as $ 7 billion. Farmers whose yields are reduced by more than 75 percent will come in for increased government payments under the legislation. These payments will be equal to 90 percent of losses over that 75 percent level.

 A cease-fire is scheduled to begin Aug. 20 in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war, which has killed or wounded more than 1 million people. Here, at a glance, are developments Tuesday in the efforts to end the war:

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The financially strapped <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> created a $ 74 million observer corps to monitor the truce between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, but Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said, `` I simply do not have the money'' to pay for it. <PERSON> Marrack </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>, undersecretary-general in charge of peacekeeping operations, said the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> probably would be summoned to special session this week to assess the membership for funds.

 In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, state television announced Monday's cease-fire declaration after midnight, declaring victory in the war and three days of celebration.

In <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acting commander-in-chief, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, said his nation is seeking peace but must remain vigilant in the face of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> `` mischief.'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wo n't initiate any military actions, but soldiers should maintain their vigil against possible attacks.

 Three men with shotguns and pistols entered a hospital room and killed a patient and his bodyguard in what appeared to be drug-related murders, police reported Tuesday.

 <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> confessed Tuesday he helped hijack a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in 1985, but said he is `` not ready to do something like that again'' and denied he killed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver aboard. In a statement read in court, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said the four hijackers were trying to force the release of Lebanese Shiite Moslems imprisoned in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Shortly after the ordeal was over, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> released approximately 700 Shiites. `` The decision to hijack the plane came after everything else failed,'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said in his surprise confession. `` There was no other way to free the prisoners other than the means chosen.'' Thirty-nine Americans were held captive for 17 days and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed. His body was thrown onto a <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport runway. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is being tried on charges of air piracy and murder in the June 1985 <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government also has indicted <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> on charges of air piracy and murder. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> denounced <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for `` illegal conduct'' in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, condemned the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and said another hijacker had killed <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. One of <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s lawyers said <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> felt sorry for `` everyone who suffered harm.'' In reflecting on the hijacking, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> told the court: `` I am not ready to do something like that again.'' `` As I took part in the action, that happened out of the belief that there was no other way to get the release of those imprisoned. Now, I'm of the opinion that that's not the case,'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said. Under West German law <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> can be convicted of murder even if he did not actually fire the shots that killed <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, but one of his lawyers said the court would have to prove the hijackers' plans might have included possible murder. `` The court can convict him as a participant in the murder but it has to prove that he knew what he was doing,'' said <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Steck-Bromme </PERSON>. Three other hijacking suspects remain at large. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, clean-shaven in an open-neck shirt, read calmly and clearly for about 45 minutes while <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, parents of the slain diver, listened attentively to an interpreter. The Stethems, from <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, made no gestures visible to reporters through the bulletproof glass that separates them from <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, the judges and the rest of the court. `` If this act which I committed is against the law, then it is a result of illegal conduct on the part of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. He said the hijackers picked a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft `` because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the greatest ally and supporter of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Iz-al-Din </PERSON> was in charge of the hijacking and had been demanding a negotiator before shooting <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. `` The pistol was in his -LRB- Iz-al-Din's -RRB- hand,'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said. `` I did n't use it. Our orders were not to harm anyone, but I could n't convince him not to shoot. Mrs. <PERSON> Steck-Bromme </PERSON> was asked how <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> felt about the Stethems' presence in court `` He feels sorry for everyone who suffered harm through the hijacking,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Steck-Bromme </PERSON> said. The lawyer noted that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s age at the time of the hijacking remains at issue and could determine whether the court will treat him as a juvenile, young adult or an adult. But even if the court determines he was a juvenile, it could decide to sentence him as an adult and hand down a maximum life sentence. The judge asked <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> to ask his parents to come from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to testify about his age, then recessed the trial until Sept. 6. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Senz </PERSON>, another of <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s lawyers, said he hoped the confession would lead to more lenient treatment. `` The court could now decide not to summon all American witnesses because no identification is necessary,'' <PERSON> Senz </PERSON> said. West German television speculated that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s confession could lead to speedy release of a West German hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But government and foreign ministry spokesmen said they had no information about any release. One West German, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, was released in September 1987, but the second, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, remains a hostage. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> is believed to be held by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, a radical Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem group thought to be holding other Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 South African soldiers prepared Tuesday to withdraw from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> as part of a peace accord, but their rebel allies threatened to fight until they are included in peace talks. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will begin a three-week pullout of its troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> on Wednesday under terms of a cease-fire reached with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The accord also sets a Nov. 1 starting date for a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan to bring independence to <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. An estimated 3,000 South African soldiers are in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has an estimated 50,000 soldiers in the country. In <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, which has close ties to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, the national news agency said <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troops in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> were being pulled back to positions north of the 16th parallel, roughly 90 miles north of the Namibian border, as part of the agreement. The accord, announced Monday, was reached in five rounds of U.S.-mediated peace talks among <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The region's two main guerrilla armies were excluded. Spokesmen for the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which has fought for Namibian independence since 1966, said it would join in a truce in the territory starting Sept. 1. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> is believed to have a strong chance of taking power in free elections envisioned under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> independence plan. But the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, which has receievd South African and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid in its 13-year war against <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Cuban-backed government, said its 50,000 guerrillas would continue to fight until the country's Marxist leaders agree to negotiate a power-sharing arrangement `` If the <ORGANIZATION> MPLA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s ruling party -RRB- does n't accept this, the armed conflict will continue,'' <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alcides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakala </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. `` We will be back at square one.'' <PERSON> Sakala </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> was not concerned by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s pledge to halt aid to the rebels or by a possible cutoff of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. `` Our guerrillas are spread all over the country,'' <PERSON> Sakala </PERSON> said. `` We have enough supplies and popular support to continue this war for many, many years.'' The accord announced in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> is contingent on a successful outcome of a sixth round of talks the week of Aug. 22 to set a mutually agreeable timetable for withdrawal of the Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. South African commentators expressed cautious optimism Tuesday that a final settlement was in sight. `` As the winter dawn broke over the northern border of <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> this morning, there was a very real hope that, for the first time in many years, peace would come to the troubled southwestern region of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said the state-run <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` It is not the end of many years of conflict, but hopefully it is the beginning of the end,'' the television said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s chief representative in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, Administrator-General <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, told a meeting of white farmers the accord was `` an answer to prayers.'' He suggested that moderates and conservatives in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> form a coalition to oppose <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> if independence elections take place. <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON> called for the drafting of an independence constitution that would protect democracy, private enterprise and `` the first-world community'' _ a reference to the 70,000 whites in the territory of 1.3 million people. The far-right <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> urged Namibian whites Tuesday to resist the peace plan `` to prevent this beautiful and good country from lapsing into poverty, malpractices and suffering as has happened elsewhere in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> where communist tyranny stepped in.'' <LOCATION> SWAPO </LOCATION>, which has pledged to allow multiparty democracy if it took power in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, said in a statement it will `` do its level best to help in making the peace process in the southwestern <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> region irreversible and successful, provided the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> regime also shows the political will to do the same.'' The group said a military commission would be formed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to monitor the cease-fire. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has invited <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to visit the region. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief's spokesman, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, said Tuesday the invitation was `` under consideration.'' A potential problem in the granting of independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> is funding. The cost has been estimated at $ 600 million, and a senior <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said Monday that the cash-strapped body may have trouble financing a cease-fire observer team it will send to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Another unresolved issue is <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s demand that <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> close down bases of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the main guerrilla group fighting to end white rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> says there are seven <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> bases in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebina </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` is merely seeking some diversion from the talks ... The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> camps are not connected with the talks.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee will take the first step Sept. 7 in disciplinary proceedings against Fofo I.F. <PERSON> Sunia </PERSON>, the Democratic delegate from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, the panel said Tuesday. The committee said the disciplinary hearing also will consider the case of <PERSON> Sunia </PERSON>'s administrative assistant, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Iuli </PERSON>. Both men pleaded guilty in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court on Aug. 3 to charges they conspired to defraud the government.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> exchanged new volleys in their political dogfight Tuesday, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> placing the Democratic nominee out on the `` very, very far liberal fringe.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> retorted with a line borrowed from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s boss: `` There he goes again.'' Just six days before the Republican National Convention opens in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, a new Gallup Poll showed the presidential race tightening. The survey gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 49 percent to 42 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in telephone interviews with 1,004 registered voters Aug. 5-7. A Gallup survey two weeks ago gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a 17-point lead _ 54-37 _ coming out of the Democratic convention. Both surveys had a 3 percentage point margin of error. `` Things are moving. We're beginning to get them in focus. Watch and you'll see these surveys turn around,'' the vice president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> talking about crime and drugs, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> discussing housing and attending the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> meeting. But both candidates took the occasion to launch new barrages _ claiming the other is fuzzy on the issues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is trying to hide his record as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` He's trying to run away from a record in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> on the very, very far liberal fringe of the political fringe of the political spectrum and I have to pin him down,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` He thinks he can pre-empt the middle.'' `` There he goes again,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded at a news conference in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, echoing <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s famous retort to <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in their 1980 presidential debate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, called `` the stealth candidate'' on Monday by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, struck back Tuesday with a mirror-image barrage at the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee-to-be. `` I do n't think <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s positions are clear on much of anything,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters as he flew to <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. On foreign policy _ where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> inexperienced _ the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said it is the vice president who has little to say. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said only <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s positions are clear only in his support for Contra aid, which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called `` this endless fiasco in Central America.'' `` I do n't know. Do you know where he stands?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said to reporters. `` I do n't think anybody knows where he is on these things.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met with fellow Democratic governors at the end of their summer meeting, taking part in a joking presentation to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, picked to deliver the keynote speech of the Republican convention. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> _ whose lengthy Democratic keynote speech drew derisive comments _ gave <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> a large hourglass. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, where the GOP convention opens Monday, preparations hummed along. Carpenters banged away on the half-million-dollar podium in the Superdome and the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform committee trudged through the drafting of each policy plank for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his still-unnamed running mate. Nearly 30,000 words of working papers for the platform, released Tuesday, echoed the sentiments of the 1984 platform _ from a no-tax increase pledge to support for anti-abortion constitutional amendment. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposals on such matters as child care and education were added to the 1984 stances. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> for his last major campaign trip before the convention, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> focused on building an image as a hard-liner on law enforcement. `` Let's not take away the guns of innocent citizens,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the state chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police in Erie. `` Let's get tougher on the criminals. Liberals in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> drew his fire on the fight against drugs. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is full of rhetorical heroes on the issue of drugs, but when it comes to law enforcement a lot of the liberals there go AWOL,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Republicans are trying to orchestrate their attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> day by day, with the Tuesday theme being defense and foreign policy. `` We believe the positions taken by Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> threaten the peace, threaten world stability and threaten the protection of American interests globally,'' said former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> at a news conference held by the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform subcommittees on defense and foreign policy. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeffler </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> congressman, said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform would show <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` basically has a tall pole and a white flag to pursue his foreign policy efforts.'' In a change of pace, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had some nice things to say about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, saying the nation's foreign policies are moving toward <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' stands on U.S.-Soviet relations, the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and conflict in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` It's an administration that's growing. ... Frankly they're coming a lot closer to where I am,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` Here's an administration that five years ago was talking ` evil empire,' and now the president is walking arm-in-arm with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in Red Square.'' `` The interesting thing is the president and I are closer together on U.S.-Soviet relations than he is with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> declared victory Tuesday in the war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the sky over the <LOCATION> Tigris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> blazed with fireworks. When the announcement of a cease-fire was read over state television soon after midnight Monday, exuberant Iraqis fired tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition into the sky. The television urged Iraqis to `` celebrate the great victory achieved by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'' on `` the greatest day of all.'' It declared three days of celebration to mark the end of the 8-year-old war, which killed or wounded more than 1 million people and cost the combatants hundreds of billions of dollars. It also appealed for a halt to the shooting, which caused an undisclosed number of casualties, but to no avail. Gunfire continued 24 hours later. `` This is the pressure of pent-up emotion which has built for eight years,'' Iraqi writer <PERSON> Jabra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabra </PERSON> told a visitor as shots sounded in the streets outside his home Tuesday night. Streets throughout the capital were gridlocked with horn-honking cars into the early hours Wednesday as Iraqis jumped from their vehicles to dance in the streets, or dangled from windows or car rooftops. After the announcement on television, a man at the entrance of the Rashid hotel shouted `` The war is over! Victory for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>!'' and gazed at the flashes overhead. A woman beside him said: `` The war is over, praise be to God!'' Tracers, flares and machine-gun bullets streamed into the air for hours after the announcement. The crack and stutter of firing filled the night. `` Here, take this!'' joyful security men told a reporter, thrusting a loaded <PERSON> Kalashnikov </PERSON> assault rifle at him. The guards later fired the gun into the air, laughing with other security men across the street who also were shooting. A car in the hotel parking lot had a new bullet hole in its hood. Children scampered about collecting empty cartridge casings. Celebrants danced on the beds of pickups and waved palm fronds from car windows. People beat drums and sang as others danced in the streets. Later Tuesday, a day after <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> announced that a cease-fire would begin Aug. 20, the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> organized processions in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. Marchers waved pictures of President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. They raised <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> flags beside banners reading `` The Hero of Peace, President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'' and `` Masses of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> Congratulate the Hero of Victory.'' In what the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> called the `` Communique of Communiques,'' the president proclaimed the three-day holiday and said: `` In the name of all Arabs and mankind, we call on Iraqis to celebrate this great victory.'' For the first time in nearly eight years, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> did not issue a daily war communique. The last one, No. 3288 on Monday, reported only minor skirmishes. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> attended a morning celebration at Grand Festivities Park in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. The news agency said <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, emir of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, telephoned congratulations and declared Thursday a day of celebration in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The official news agency said soldiers fired 10,000 artillery rounds to celebrate. It said 101 shots were fired in joy during each of the five Moslem prayer times Tuesday in 17 Iraqi cities and governorates. Moslem are required to face <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, birthplace of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, and pray each day at dawn, noon, afternoon, evening and night.

 Soldiers fired on young Palestinians who hurled stones and bottles Tuesday, killing a teen-ager, hospital officials said. Israeli aircraft bombed a radio station in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that the army said broadcast <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> propaganda. A second Palestinian died and two were seriously burned after arsonists set fire to a shack at a construction site in a Jewish suburb of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, police reported. Officials did not rule out the possibility that the attack was linked to <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> tensions. Up to 21 Arabs, including a 9-year-old boy, were reported wounded by gunfire as the Palestinian rebellion in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> began its ninth month. An army spokesman reported 13 Palestinians wounded but <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospital officials said put the number at 21. The army said a soldier was slightly injured when Palestinians stoned an army outpost near <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. At least 238 Palestinians have been killed in the uprising, which began Dec. 8, and four Israelis also have been slain. A military spokesman said the air force destroyed a PLO-run radio station and an ammunition storehouse in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in what was <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 12th air raid this year. The spokesman said the radio station, founded in early June, was used to broadcast instructions to Palestinians in the occupied territories. `` The base ... was a radio station used for propaganda and incitement broadcasts, and to pass orders for executing terror attacks,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with military regulations. In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, a police spokesman said three guerrillas were killed and 12 wounded in the raid. He said the base belonged to <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s main wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Tuesday's violence in the occupied lands coincided with a sweeping strike observed by most of the 1.5 million Arabs in the territories and called for by underground leaders to mark the ninth month of the Palestinian `` intefadeh,'' Arabic for `` uprising.'' In the latest fatality, 14-year-old <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Swei </PERSON> was fatally shot in the head during a clash between troops and dozens of Arab youths hurling stones and bottles in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>, 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a spokesman at a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> clinic said. An army spokesman denied the boy was shot by troops. He said a doctor at the clinic told army investigators there were no signs of a bullet wound on <PERSON> Swei </PERSON>'s body. He did not identify the doctor. Palestinian youths took the body from the clinic and, despite a curfew imposed on <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>, buried it in the town's cemetery, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said. Hundreds of Palestinians attended the burial, chanting <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> slogans as they carried the body wrapped in a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag, witnesses told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Troops surrounded the cemetery but no clashes were reported. Curfews also were in effect Tuesday on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> refugee camp of <LOCATION> Tulkarm </LOCATION>, the town of <PERSON> Husan </PERSON> and two <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camps. Police, meanwhile, arrested three Palestinians from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> suspected of killing 65-year-old <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, of the <PERSON> Shafir </PERSON> collective farming settlement, last week. Regional police commander <PERSON> Tuvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Golan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> the three youths, all aged 17, acted out of anti-Israeli feelings but also intended to rob the woman. On Monday night, arsonists torched a shack in the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb of Or Yehuda housing three Palestinian construction workers, police said. All three were seriously burned and one died early Tuesday of his wounds. Police refused to rule out the possibility that the attack was related to Israeli-Arab tension. However, <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> in the past also have used violence to try to prevent fellow Palestinians from working at jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Arab merchants shuttered their shops and many of the 110,000 who work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> stayed home from their jobs, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports and witnesses said. The strike was ordered by the PLO-linked leadership in its underground Leaflet No. 23. Also Tuesday, disturbances were reported as American-born Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>'s anti-Arab <ORGANIZATION> Kach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> held a news conference in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> to name its candidates for November's elections. Members of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Mapam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> demonstrated outside and police were summoned to the site after a bomb threat. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>'s party calls for expelling all Arabs from Israeli-held territory.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on Tuesday for talks with the presidents of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> about the region's conflicts and the leftist Nicaraguan government. The secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, who escaped harm in a bomb attack on his motorcade Monday in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, played an hour of tennis with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrigal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nieto </PERSON> and had breakfast with President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> before going to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. It is <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s third visit to the area since June. Asked why his trips were so frequent, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he wanted `` to reinforce an economic opening and political freedom'' in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He said he briefed <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> on his trip to South American, and the Costa Rican president reported on his efforts to enforce the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> peace plan of Aug. 7, 1987. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> is the plan's author and won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize because of it, but <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s civil wars continue. During his first visit in June, the secretary tried to persuade <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> join the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a declaration accusing the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> of failing to live up to the peace plan. He failed to get the signatures of the four foreign ministers at a meeting Aug. 1 in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, to which <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was not invited. The declaration released simply reiterated support for democracy and progress in the region. <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> objected to a strongly worded statement accusing the Sandinistas of failing to initiate democratic reforms in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and of cracking down on opposition groups. Leaders of the two countries were said to feel that might cause the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to adopt an even tougher stance. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> visited with Guatemalan President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> last week after the foreign ministers' conference. On Tuesday afternoon, he spent two hours with Honduran President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> and flew to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> for talks with Salvadoran Vice President <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Claramount </PERSON>. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> is substituting for President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, who is undergoing chemotherapy for terminal liver cancer in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> army hospital. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> are close <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s effort to isolate the Sandinista government, which the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration considers a threat to security in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has poured military and economic aid into <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> for eight years to help it fight a leftist guerrilla insurrection. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> also aids <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, who have supply and staging bases in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> near the Nicaraguan border. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has visited <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> as part of a 10-day tour of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that began Aug. 1.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Tuesday nominated <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, a ranch foreman's son who rose to be president of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, to be secretary of education and the first Hispanic ever to serve in the Cabinet. Although the nomination came during a presidential campaign in which both candidates are eagerly courting the Hispanic vote, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he chose <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> `` because he seemed to be the best-fitted man'' for the job. If confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, 61, will succeed <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who announced in May that he is stepping down on Sept. 20. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is certain to receive the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination for president next week, has said that if elected he would name a Hispanic to the Cabinet. Asked whether he was `` stealing some of his -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s -RRB- thunder,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied: `` No. I ` m just still working at the job here.'' <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, called the nomination `` just a ploy to help get <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> elected and carry <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. A classic case of tokenism.'' `` We are glad that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has finally appointed a Hispanic to the Cabinet, especiall in the education field,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON> said. `` However, we feel this particular announcement is politically motivated. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> is like a substitute teacher. He wo n't have the clout to change anything in the little time he has.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> endorsed Democratic nominee <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> against <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the 1984 presidential election. The organization has said it will announce its 1988 candidate endorsement on Sept. 8. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION>, called the nomination `` an outstanding move.'' `` I'm sorry that it took so long,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> said, but `` it's a very smart, shrewd move by the administration.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> added that <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>' selection was intended to `` mask certain deficiencies in the administration's policies toward Hispanic Americans, but I think we have finally demonstrated to the administration that education is of crucial importance to Hispanics in this country.'' Members of the education community, canvassed by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said they knew nothing about <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>. A typical response came from <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, an association of colleges and universities. `` I do n't know Mr. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> personally or professionally, but if he is confirmed, we will be happy to work with him on behalf of higher education,'' <PERSON> Atwell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, who appeared with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> before reporters in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> briefing room, said, `` This administration has clearly demonstrated that education is one of its highest priorities, and the initiatives that you have begun in this vital area will be of tremendous benefit to this nation and to this nation's future.'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, who has been president of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> since 1980, had announced in May that he planned to resign in July 1989. He said he planned to go on leave and then return to teach anatomy in the medical school, where he is a tenured professor. He is a native of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where his father was a foreman on the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gertrudis </LOCATION> division of the huge King Ranch. He and his wife, the former <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON>, have 10 children. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> received the National Hispanic Leadership award of the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> in July for his efforts to reduce the dropout rate among Hispanic youth. He is a former dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. He began his teaching career as an associate anatomy professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. At <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>, he headed a university and health sciences center with more than 24,000 students and 8,500 employees. `` His story is an American success story,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>. `` It is a tribute to his ability, to his hard work and to opportunity in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also saluted <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, calling him `` the best thing to happen to American education since the <PERSON> McGuffey </PERSON> reader.'' Introducing <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, the president said that `` with his administrative skills and his many accomplishments in the field of education, Dr. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> is an ideal selection for this Cabinet post.'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> is not a medical doctor, but received a Ph.D. in physiology in 1954 from <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>. `` His commitment to the profession of teaching and to excellence in education, his belief in getting back to basics and things like homework and above all his emphasis on education's special importance to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s minorities are messages I hope that he will sound far and wide across the nation,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The president ended his introductory remarks by addressing his nominee with a bit of Spanish, `` Mi casa es su casa,'' or `` My house is your house.''

<HEAD>Defense Minister Outlines Problems in Soviet Military</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> must fight complacency in the ranks and delays in new weapons programs if it is to keep other countries from gaining military superiority. In an article published Tuesday, <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> recommended ambitious action to cleanse the military of outdated attitudes, improve the reliability of military hardware and make the `` human factor'' dominant in the Soviet military. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>'s article in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> was an unusually frank account of problems in the Soviet military. Before <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> began his policy of glasnost, or openness, the military was presented only as strong and problem-free. The defense minister has spoken candidly of the military's problems since he was appointed in May 1987 The 64-year-old army genera was quoted as saying in a speech three months ago that Soviet soldiers in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> lack discipline and battle readiness. His latest comments encompassed the entire Soviet armed forces. `` Our military thought is still partially constrained by inertia, routine and a lack of competition of ideas and opinions,'' he wrote. He said the gap must be reduced between theoretical research on new weapons and their actual development and deployment, and oversimplification and showiness must be removed from military training. Bureaucracy and a tendency to blame problems on others plagues the Soviet armed forces at all levels, <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> declared. He said young commanders, soldiers and officers take a passive attitude toward deficiences. Senior officers must not alienate themselves from those they command, he wrote, and `` all ideological and political upbringing must be built so that the person is always in the center of attention.'' <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> said the goal should not be `` accumulation of military might of the armed forces ... but maintenance of the might at a level that precludes military superiority over us and guarantees a reliable defense.'' Last week, <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> toured Soviet military facilities with <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, the visiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense secretary.

 A young Wall Street lawyer at the center of an insider trading ring known as the `` Yuppie Five'' was sentenced to four months in prison Tuesday, nearly two years after he admitted his guilt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> pleaded guilty in November 1986 to four criminal counts for his part in an insider trading scheme with three other Wall Street professionals and an investor. The five, who have all pleaded guilty to various charges, were all in their 20s at the time of the indictment and were dubbed the `` Yuppie Five.'' The case had nothing to do with major insider trading cases involving <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, said officials. <PERSON> David </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the last to plead guilty, after his pre-trial motions were denied by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> in late 1986, pleaded guilty to conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud and obstruction of a Securities and Exchange Comnmission investigation. `` You completely disrupt the forces of the free market and help to create incredible cynicism among the general populace,'' <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> lectured <PERSON> David </PERSON>. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Fennell </PERSON> asked for leniency, noting that <PERSON> David </PERSON> faces disbarment and has been driving a cab to support himself. Visibly irritated, <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> countered: `` I do n't think anyone should confuse the practice of law with a right _ it's a privilege!'' `` I regret my conduct,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> told <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> before sentence was imposed and asked the judge for an opportunity `` to help rebuild my life as I have tried to do.'' `` If I just say ` Go and sin no more,' I'm making a mockery of the process,'' said <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, slapping his own wrist. He sentenced <PERSON> David </PERSON> to four months in prison and four years probation. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> did not impose a fine but <PERSON> David </PERSON> faces civil penalties of between $ 50,000 and $ 150,000 under a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> consent agreement. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowenson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, noted that <PERSON> David </PERSON> had cooperated extensively with federal investigators for almost two years and that if any future trials arise from the probe `` Mr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> would be an important government witness.''

He said he disposed of the property in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> before his arrest in February 1987 and that he did n't believe he retains any title to the properties in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` As far as I know, the property -LRB- on <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay -RRB- was confiscated by <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> officials,'' he said. `` I am under the understanding that the property has been totally ransacked and eaten by termites. If it has any value, it would be very little,'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said. He said if he still owns the property in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, `` it has no value.'' `` I have nothing but the suit on my back,'' said <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, adding that he had no bank accounts, stocks, bonds or any other assets. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> was tried with <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 38, reputed to be one of the leaders of the violent Colombian <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, believed to responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into this country. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was sentenced to life in prison without parole, plus 135 years, and fined $ 325,000. <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> was appointed by <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> to represent <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> in his appeal until the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> can hire private counsel, replacing trial attorneys <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinon </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> denied having any assets, the sentencing memorandum prepared by former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, now a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, indicates the government believes that <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> continued to smuggle cocaine until his arrest in 1987 and was not a poor coconut farmer living off the land as he told <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>. According to the memo, <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Driver </ORGANIZATION> learned in late 1986 that <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> was living in a remote location on the east coast of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` Between that time and the time of his arrest on Feb. 6, 1987, <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> was involved in planning large cocaine shipments to the western <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. ... The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has two tape recordings of <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> talking with a confidential source in connection with these efforts.'' <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> were convicted of being members of a conspiracy which smuggled some 3.3 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> via <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay, a private island in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. The total amount of cocaine documented in trial testimony was 19,700 pounds.

<TEXT>
 A woman convicted of adultery and sentenced to death by stoning has been aquitted in a retrial and freed. <PERSON> Shahida </PERSON> <PERSON> Parveen </PERSON>, 25, said Tuesday: `` I have started a new life, I prayed to God who helped me and my husband get justice.'' A district court judge in this southern city issued the acquittal verdict Monday. Ms. <PERSON> Shahida </PERSON> was convicted on Nov. 7, 1987 of adultery by an Islamic court that sentenced her to death by stoning. She had been jailed on the basis of a complaint filed by her former husband, <PERSON> Khushi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON>, after she married <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarwar </PERSON>, her cousin. The court declared she was still legally married to <PERSON> Khushi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Shahida </PERSON>, a carpenter's daughter, was only 13 when she married <PERSON> Khushi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON>, who was 40 at the time.

Following an investigation the retrial in district court was ordered. Islamic law requires a confession or statements by four witnesses to prove adultery. The district court ruled that Ms. <PERSON> Shahida </PERSON> had not made a confession and there were no witnesses. `` My months in prison are days I can not forget,'' she said Tuesday. `` I was a victim of circumstances and my former husband wanted revenge because I married <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarwar </PERSON>.''

 A bright magnesium fire caused a series of small explosions and scared residents of this community early Tuesday, only months after an explosion destroyed a nearby plant that made a rocket fuel component. No one was injured in the pre-dawn blaze at a <ORGANIZATION> Titanium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant, but some residents fled the area briefly after they were awakened by as many as six small explosions. Police, unsure of the nature of the problem, began to evacuate nearby residents but allowed them to return less than an hour later after firefighters brought the blaze under control. Plant Manager <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchey </PERSON> said the fire posed no danger to workers or residents. `` Everybody's spoiled by <LOCATION> PEPCON </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Ritchey </PERSON> said. `` If somebody sneezes, everybody runs for cover.'' <PERSON> Ritchey </PERSON> referred to a series of explosions at a <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant less than three miles away that killed two people, injured 326 and caused $ 73 million in propery damage May 4. That plant was one of two in the country making ammonium perchlorate, an oxidyzer in solid rocket fuel. Fire department dispatcher <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobosh </PERSON> said Tuesday's fire apparently started after some magnesium ingots melted and came into contact with water in a drain. The reaction of the metal and the water caused the small explosions, she said. Magnesium is used in the manufacture of titanium. The fire occurred outside an abandoned building at the plant, <PERSON> Ritchey </PERSON> said. Dobosh estimated damage at $ 15,000. The fire was reported at 1:50 a.m. and was under control by 2:40 a.m., dispatcher <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. Officials said 60 firefighters, including a team specializing in fires involving hazardous materials, came to the scene and smothered the fire with salt. `` It produced a cloud of pretty foul-smelling smoke, but it was not toxic,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dobosh </PERSON> said. `` It was not as bad as what it sounded like it was.'' The plant covers several blocks and dates to World War II, making it one of the oldest in <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION>, an industrial community of 55,000 people 20 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> will contribute 385 military personnel to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force that will monitor the cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON> said Tuesday.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, commenting as aides pointed to encouraging new poll figures, said Tuesday, `` Watch and you'll see these surveys turn around.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not cite any figures to back up his claim that he was catching up to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, his press secretary, noted a Gallup poll that said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lead has dropped from 17 points just after the Democratic convention to seven points, 49 percent to 42 percent. `` That is turning around,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' advantage. `` You watch, in the next couple of days you'll see evidence of the turnaround on that. ... Things are moving. We're beginning to get them in focus.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also renewed his criticism of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, accusing his Democratic presidential rival of trying to run away from a record `` on the very, very far liberal fringe.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, when told of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remarks, said merely, `` There he goes again,'' harking back to a line that then-candidate <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used to great effect in a debate with President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1980. Just six days before the opening of the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, where he will become the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he still has not decided who will be his running mate. `` I'm not close in the sense of like tomorrow making a final decision,'' the vice president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he wants to keep his decision a secret until the final day of the convention. Attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his opponent was trying to avoid being specific on issues. `` He's trying to run away from a record in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> on the very, very far liberal fringe of the political fringe of the political spectrum and I have to pin him down,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He thinks he can preempt the middle,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added. The vice president spoke at an airport news conference in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> after a speech and private fund-raiser earlier in Erie. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later cut the ribbon to open a Polish-American cultural center in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and, before a crowd of hundreds in a downtown street, paid tribute to Roman Catholic Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Krol </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> as `` an inspiration to all of us in public life or private life.'' He also said there was a `` special link between <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' In Erie, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> addressed the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, drawing loud applause with lines such as, `` So let's not take away the guns of innocent citizens; let's get tougher on the criminals.'' He said the nation should band together to fight illegal drugs with the same fervor as was demonstrated in World War II. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said states that decriminalized possession of drugs `` should recriminalize it.'' Asked later if he felt that possession of marijuana should be made a felony, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I would be very tempted to make it strong, to make it a felony.'' He said he would be interested in what law enforcement officials felt. Saying his speech was non-partisan, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not mention <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by name. But he criticized the American Civil Liberties, of which he has said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a member, saying its `` first concerns are the protection of criminals' rights and the potential abuse of power by police.'' And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has criticized the prison furlough program in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, said he was angered by `` the arrogant face of a criminal, back on the street once more because of a permissive plea bargain or some furlough.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stressed his anti-crime theme again in an appearance Tuesday night at the `` National Night Out Against Crime,'' where he switched on a giant lightbulb in downtown <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> in a symbolic message that people intend to fight for safe neighborhoods. `` For those who commit drug related murders and for those kingpins who are poisoning our kids the penalty shoudl be death,'' the vice president told an audience of about 200, adding that the death penalty should also apply to people who kill police officers. Democrats on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> called a news briefing to ridicule <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments on crime-fighting. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> thinks that hanging around with all the criminals in the administration makes him tough on crime,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` Since 1981, this administration has failed to support one nickel going to state and local law enforcement,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> narcotics committee. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was urging speakers at next week's Republican convention to be positive and to focus on the issues. `` But I ca n't guarantee that somebody's not going to take a swipe at <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I have a lot of friends out there and they did n't like the vicious, personal attacks -LRB- against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the Democratic convention -RRB- andI did not react to them, but I ca n't control everybody but I'm urging them to stay positive, as I'm doing.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added, `` There's a lot of people out there that want to go after'em. There's a lot of people that feel it was a very unfair, totally negative tune there.'' Emphasizing policy differences, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` When he says he's against the death penalty for everything, the country has a right to know it. I happen to think some crimes are bad enough, you should.

 An anti-abortion protest in which activists are staying in jail by refusing to give their names ebbed as dozens were released on bail, but an organizer vowed there would be more demonstrations. A total of 63 protesters gave their names to authorities Monday and Tuesday and were released on bail, said <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, director of the city's Correctional Center. The center has served as the initial holding facility for the 276 protesters arrested since demonstrations began during the Democratic National Convention July 19. The releases left only 22 protesters in the city jail. Another 63 protesters have been bound over to <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and are being held in <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail. They have claimed to represent aborted fetuses and have identified themselves only as Baby <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> or Baby <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>. The others have been released sporadically since their arrests. The protesters have been held on charges of criminal trespass or giving a false name to police. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION>, the group that organized the anti-abortion protests, said there will be a new round of demonstrations. `` I think you can expect the next one in the morning,'' he said, but declined to give details. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said the protesters who identified themselves and were released had made only a short-term commitment to the group's effort Those remaining in county jail are prepared to remain indefinitely, he said. The demonstrators were fingerprinted after their arrests as a matter of routine but authorities said Monday they were not using the prints to try to identify them. The protesters have put a strain on <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s already crowded jail, officials said. Maj. <PERSON> A.M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, assistant director of the county jail, said the facility is at capacity. The protesters still in city jail were scheduled for a court hearing Wednesday, and they could be transferred to the county jail then. If more protesters are arrested, `` they most likely will have to start sleeping on the floor, because we are at capacity,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said. `` We'll still feed them, we'll give them medical treatment. But they'll sleep on the floor.'' <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said daily coverage of the protests on the `` 700 Club,'' former presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s cable television show, has helped attract more anti-abortion activists to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` He is our one link to Christians all across the country that we have not had from the secular media,'' said <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said the city has spent $ 61,000 to jail the demonstrators, and sheriff's Chief Deputy <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> said the county has spent about $ 66,000 so far.

Monday's game between the <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phillies </ORGANIZATION> _ the first at night in the stadium's 74-year history _ was postponed after heavy rain fell with the <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> leading 3-1 in the bottom of the fourth inning.

Also missing were the T-shirts with blinking lights, the <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> batting helmets with flashlights taped on top, and hords of merrymakers who came looking for history Monday night. `` Last night was celebrity night and historic-event seeker's night,'' said <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy chief of special `` Tonight is real fan night ... tonight we have real <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> fans who support the team all season long, through thick and thin.'' <PERSON> Zeke </PERSON> <PERSON> Closen </PERSON>, 69, a retired engineer from <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, said he felt he was seeing history made Tuesday night. `` The ones who came last night said ` we saw the first night game,''' he said. `` But ask them what the score was or who won.

Monday's game came 40 years after the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> lighted up for night baseball and left <LOCATION> Wrigley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> the only day-only holdout. Still, some opponents said the aborted game proved that their fears of rowdy fans and illegal parking were on target. `` There was all this screaming and cursing,'' said <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Oing </PERSON>, a 20-year <LOCATION> Wrigleyville </LOCATION> resident who lives less than a block from the stadium. `` Who wants to hear that?

State and local authorities said it was unlikely the debris posed a public health hazard. `` We do n't foresee any problems at this time as far as closing the beaches,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, police chief of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, where syringes and vials such as those used in blood tests were found in a trash bag Monday night. Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the problem may have been exaggerated because of recent concerns at some Northeast beaches. `` In the past, there have always been occasions of things like syringes or test tubes washing up onto the beach, but people would just pick them up and throw them away,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` But, with the well-publicized problems of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> beaches, people are more alert to potential problems with medical debris.'' Numerous beaches have been closed for varying periods this summer along the coasts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> because of medical waste and sewage. A similar problem has cropped up on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, with several hundred syringes, medical-type tubes and plastic containers washing ashore over the weekend near <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> environmental crews wearing plastic gloves combed a private beach Tuesday. `` I personally view this as probably one of the most disgusting and heinous dumpings I've seen of any sort in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and we see dozens every month, usually hazardous waste,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> as he surveyed the beach cleanup. `` This is the only time we had anything of this magnitude of hospital, possibly infectious, waste,'' said Shank. He and <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON>, director of environmental health for <LOCATION> Cuyahoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, advised swimmers to avoid <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> beach, seven miles from downtown <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON> said syringes occasionally wash ashore, possibly insulin needles that pass through the sewage system into <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, but the large number found along the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> beach `` is unreasonable.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s governor related the problems being faced by the coasts to the lack of hazardous waste dumps in the country. `` If we can not provide adequate facilities for properly disposing of hazardous wastes, people are going to dump them in the ocean,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` We made a real mistake last year in not deciding on a hazardous waste site for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.'' Dr. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, state health director, led a team to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> on Tuesday to investigate the problem and urged people to remain calm. A 6-inch glass tube containing a brown substance was found there Saturday and was shipped to a state public health laboratory Tuesday. <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> also played down the danger of the find there. `` It's not medical debris as we know it,'' he said. `` It's mixed in with waste food products. We do not think it is related to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> problem. We think it is related to a passing vessel.''

 A senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official has flown to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats and leading Panamanians about the political situation in that country, the department said Tuesday. Deputy spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramowitz </PERSON>, who heads the department's bureau of intelligence and research, was sent to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. She gave no other details. Other officials, who spoke only on condition they not be identified, said <PERSON> Abramowitz </PERSON>'s visit does not represent a renewal of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to pressure <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to relinquish power. That effort collapsed last May when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> balked at the terms proposed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoys. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> called off negotiations and said no further talks would be held. It was not clear whether <PERSON> Abramowitz </PERSON> planned to meet with representatives of the Noriega-led government, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has refused to recognize since it took office nearly six months ago. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government recognizes ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as the legitimate authority in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The officials attached no significance to the fact that <PERSON> Abramowitz </PERSON> is making the trip during the same week when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will observe the fifth anniversary of his accession as commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces on Aug. 12. In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> called <PERSON> Abramowitz </PERSON>' visit `` not only part of the aggression against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> but also -LRB- of that -RRB- against <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' He spoke with reporters after an hour-long meeting Tuesday with Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. The visit, he said, shows `` a lack of respect that only shows how in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> they -LRB- <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> government officials -RRB- impose force and injustice on those who are weaker.'' A senior <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military official, who asked not to be identified, said <PERSON> Abramowitz </PERSON> met with local opposition leaders about a plan against the government. He said it included street disturbances by secondary students in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and Colon, on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> end of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, and attacks on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and other government leaders. The object is to force the resignation of <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, named interim president after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s removal, the source said. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <PERSON> Abramowitz </PERSON> would be in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` several days.'' The spokesman said he would meet with `` people with many points of view'' but did not confirm the report of talks with opposition leaders. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had been trying in May to work out an agreement under which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would resign as defense chief on that anniversary. Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, a leader of anti-Noriega forces in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, has said he believes <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> may use the anniversary to make an important announcement, possibly to launch his candidacy for presidential elections next May. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, indicted on drug smuggling charges by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> six months ago, gave a warm welcome Monday to visiting Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, who said that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> `` are under attack by imperialist policies'' of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The administration has attempted through economic and diplomatic pressure to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure. It was reported two weeks ago that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had a approved a covert plan that involved encouraging opposition political activities aimed at discrediting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, in a move to fight inflation, said Tuesday it was boosting its key bank lending rate for the first time in nearly a year. Analysts said other interest rates likely would head higher as a result. With only three months left before the presidential election, the board members, all appointed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, sent a dramatic signal that they were willing to push up interest rates to dampen inflationary pressures even at the risk of endangering Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential aspirations. The increase in the discount rate, from 6 percent to 6.5 percent, was adopted by a 6-0 vote and took effect immediately. It was the first change since Sept. 4 and put the rate at its highest in more than two years.

The increase in the discount rate, to 6.5 percent from 6 percent, was made `` to reduce inflationary pressures -LRB- and -RRB- ... in light of the growing spread of market interest rates over the discount rate,'' according to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>. Many economists predicted other interest rates, including those on mortgages or home-equity loans, would rise as a result.

Following a recent sold-out performance in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, a music critic for <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s leading daily, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pais </LOCATION>, called <PERSON> Jeronimo </PERSON> exceptionally talented. <PERSON> Jeronimo </PERSON> began playing professionally three years ago when his guitar was nearly as big as he was. He has been studying since he was 5 with his father, the noted flamenco guitarist <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Maya </PERSON>. He also studies classical guitar at a <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> conservatory. <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> says his son's talent and success are rooted in hard work, not in any type of gift from God. Flamenco, which encompasses singing, guitar-playing, dancing and hand-clapping, traces its roots to 16th century southern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> where it emerged as the artistic response of Gypsies to widespread repression, and was influenced by elements of Jewish and Moorish music. Sometimes, his father lets <PERSON> Jeronimo </PERSON> stay up to play in a 3 a.m. `` juerga'' _ a sort of flamenco jam session _ at <LOCATION> Candela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s hangout for flamenco artists and aficionados where he wows the late-night crowd with the depth and sensitivity of his playing Professional flamenco guitarists call him a young maestro who plays at a level far advanced for his age. World-famous guitarist <PERSON> Sabicas </PERSON> says he has never heard a youngster play so well. <PERSON> Jeronimo </PERSON> has already appeared twice in the annual `` Flamenco Summit'' in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, on a youth program in 1985 and as a featured soloist last year, a spot usually reserved for such talents as <PERSON> Paco </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> says <PERSON> Jeronimo </PERSON>, his other son and two daughters often get together with him at home and hold their own `` juergas.'' `` As Gypsies, we externalize our feelings and emotions,'' the father said. `` We could be sitting around, and then we start singing and dancing just because we feel like it.'' <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> says his son has been fortunate not to encounter the discrimination many Gypsy children suffer in Spanish schools. `` He's very down to earth, and in the school, people look up to him,'' he said. <PERSON> Jeronimo </PERSON>, who wants to travel to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ `` to see the big <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> skyscrapers'' _ also likes Brazilian and jazz guitar and says his favorite classical composers include <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> and <PERSON> Debussy </PERSON>, the latter particularly because many of his compositions were based on flamenco patterns.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> raised the discount rate to 6.5 percent from 6 percent this week, causing economic forecasts to flurry about like a flock of pigeons escaped from the coop. It was confusing. Some said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had to act to slow the economy, which was overheating, and some said the action would be the death of the economy, which already might have been showing signs of slowing. Some said it would hurt stocks, and some said it would make them more attractive, since it might further strengthen the dollar, which in turn would make foreigners with lots of money want dollar-denominated investments. All this debating will continue for weeks to come and, impressive as it might sound, could in the end, if there is one, add up to nothing at all. As one economist observes, there seems to be a paucity of common sense of late. What is proven is that -LRB- 1 -RRB- economists disagree, -LRB- 2 -RRB- they often disagree impressively but not always with erudition, and -LRB- 3 -RRB- very few people really know where the economy is going, and that may include the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, economist and author of the lament about common sense, noted a while ago that `` while economists have occasionally been more spectacularly wrong, never have they been so consistently wrong in so many small ways.'' <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist and vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>, has attempted to keep himself free from the snares of abstract formulas and computer models that cause some economists to leave reality. It allows him to comment, as he did in his latest outlook, that `` what is missing from most models is common sense.'' In forecasting, he says, it may be more useful to observe if your driving is impeded by public works projects, a sure sign of prosperity, `` rather than looking at the quadratic reaction function of monocentric economic agents.'' Economists believe in economic models, but he observes that those models are only as good as the data put into them. In his view, many of the models could be filled with irrelevancies _ with material meant for earlier eras. `` There are some real changes going on in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> economy that may require some revisions in the way we look at what goes on,'' he says. The conventional wisdom is being questioned. Old notions might not fit today. At the same time, he continues, economists are under growing pressure to comment. `` More and more economists are being asked to comment on every little statistic,'' he says. Combine this pressure with those shaky models, says <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, and you force economists to wing it. `` Often it does n't work. Their answers are dull, incomprehensible, wrong, or all of the above,'' he states, adding: `` What I am really suuggesting is that most of economics, at least from the perspective of the general public, is common sense. `` Too much, the profession relies on spatial location models to determine the best markets, rather than asking regional franchise managers where they will be placing their franchises and why.'' From <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>'s perspective, an oddity and irony of the scene is `` the more esteemed the credentials of the economists, the more learned and academic the background, the more ` scientific' the models are, the worse are the answers.' Again, he calls for common sense, plain thinking and clear expression, all of which seem, from time to time, to be forgotten by many who attempt to think profoundly. And that brings him to <PERSON> Gracie </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, the old comedy partner of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. `` I think, in essence, she is a useful guide to the times,'' says <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>. `` Although <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION>'s strings of logic were as convoluted as DNA, they were always grounded in some observation of the real rather than some assumption.''

<HEAD>Rowdy Aviator Pancho Barnes Featured In Television Movie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZANNE GAMBOA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the best-selling autobiography of test pilot <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON>, pioneer flyer <PERSON> Pancho </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> is recalled by her colleagues as a foul-mouthed hell-raiser with a face like `` a bucket of worms.'' The memoir, `` Yeager,'' attributes the colorful description of <PERSON> Pancho </PERSON>'s appearance to <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON>'s friend, <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Schleeh </PERSON>. In a new TV movie about the aviator's freestyle life, `` <PERSON> Pancho </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>,'' actress <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertinelli </PERSON> portrays the portly adventure seeker. But the movie's producers admit they did n't cast for physical resemblance. `` This is based on her character, and the spirit of it is what we hope to capture,'' said executive producer <PERSON> Blue </PERSON> <PERSON> Andre </PERSON>. It took four years of combing through letters, photos, aviation books and other research materials before <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> was ready to film the three-hour feature, being shot this summer entirely in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with largely in-state crew, staff and actors. `` Pancho'' was born <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Leontine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>. The granddaughter of <PERSON> Thaddeus </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, a scientist who used hydrogen balloons for artillery observation in the Civil War, she tossed aside her genteel rearing and her marriage to the Rev. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> to pursue her true love _ flying. She became one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s top-rated female pilots and the principal stunt pilot for many Hollywood movies. In 1930, she flew her Travelaire Mystery Ship at an average speed of 196.19 mph to wrest the world's speed record for women from <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Pancho </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> was better known for the rowdy hospitality she offered to the greatest pilots of her era at her <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> desert hangout, <PERSON> Pancho </PERSON>'s Fly Inn. It later became known as the Happy Bottom Riding Club, and eventually was swallowed by the expansion of <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. Her hangout forms many scenes in the critically acclaimed movie, `` The Right Stuff,'' an epic about test pilots and the nation's early astronaut program <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> was portrayed in the 1983 movie by <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, who is somewhat <PERSON> Bertinelli </PERSON>'s senior. <PERSON> Bertinelli </PERSON> acknowledges she does n't look like the woman she'll be portraying but found her to be an interesting person to play `` They sent me the script and I said, ` Yeah, she's a really cool woman,''' she said. `` And then I read <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON>. God! The way he talks about her. When I talked to <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON>, I said, ` What is it about <PERSON> Pancho </PERSON> that men loved so much?' He goes, ` Uh, uh, pilots. Pilots loved her.''' With at least 25 vintage aircraft that rent for an average $ 5,000, and expert stunt pilots, the film's flying scenes could be just as action-packed as <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>' life. In one stunt, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillard </PERSON>, a double for <PERSON> Bertinelli </PERSON>, maneuvers a World War I Stampe with a wing span of 30 feet through the 50-foot-wide opening of a steel hangar. Exiting through the rear, he pulls up to avoid a nearby cactus. The hangar stunt actually was performed by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantz </PERSON> in 1935. `` The problem is <PERSON> Pancho </PERSON> is no longer here and we know she did do some work in some <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> movies, it's just that no one documented what she did so they just lifted one stunt out that was pretty famous,'' said <PERSON> Hillard </PERSON>, president of the national <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerobatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION>. However, the adjustments in history do n't bother <PERSON> Hillard </PERSON>, who located the planes as aviation coordinator for the film. `` I think this is going to be a neat little film. I think it's going to be one of the best aviation films ever done.'' Many of the planes used for filming were stored at <LOCATION> Hartlee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, a grassy airstrip in this <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> city once used as a World War I training field. The field, operated by the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Fighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, houses a museum of vintage aircraft that are maintained in flying condition, said <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, airport manager and museum director. The Chrysler Showcase Presentation is a Blue Andre Production made in association with <ORGANIZATION> Pancho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> and distributed by <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and the filmmakers refused to reveal its cost, but <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> called it `` a very expensive and bigger than normal'' TV movie budget. `` It's a very cost-effective way of putting our message on television. The cost of production and commercial time is less than if we bought the commercials themselves,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s expense is a boon to the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy, which is rebounding from an oil and real estate bust. `` Roughly a third to a half of the location production budget is actually injected into the local budget,'' said <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film-Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in the state's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. Fifty-three local actors have roles in the movie, several playing major characters such as <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. Most of the technical staff are Texans. The movie, to be aired on CBS Oct. 25, follows <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>' life from her late teens to her early 40s.

<HEAD>Greenspan Wins Friends in Congress, Fed, In First Year Chairman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A year ago, there was talk that <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> might become the <PERSON> George </PERSON> `` Twinkle Toes'' Selkirk of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. Like Selkirk, the journeyman baseball player who took Babe <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>'s place in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>' starting lineup, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> succeeded a legend. How could this mild-mannered economist replace the towering <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, who as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> grew so large in stature that he was often described as the second most powerful man in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>? In his first year as <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has done quite well, thank you, according to the testimomy of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and private economists. He's won friends in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by being more open and candid than <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, who liked to cloak his answers at congressional hearings behind a haze of cigar smoke and deliberately vague qualifiers. He has gained solid support inside the central bank by actively seeking out the opinions of the other governors and the professional staff, who had at times felt left out of decisionmaking during <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>'s eight-year tenure. To be sure, there have been critics. At one time or another, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has been attacked for tightening credit too much, not tightening enough or for changing back and forth too often. But all agree that <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> passed his toughest test with flying colors. When the stock market suffered its worst day ever, a 508-point drop on Oct. 19, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> acted decisively. Mindful of the mistakes the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had made in the 1929 market collapse, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> quickly reassured a jittery financial system that the central bank would supply all the credit necessary to compensate for the sudden loss of one-half trillion dollars in stock market wealth. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> began developing contingency plans for just such a calamity as soon as he took office on Aug. 11, 1987, ordering staffers to draw up a game plan for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to follow in the event of a market emergency. The result was a loose-leaf notebook with a pink coversheet marked `` restricted-controlled,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s label for top secret. This document, which called for establishing a crisis-command post at the central bank, became the guidebook <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> and other top policy-makers used after Black Monday. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> ran the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s crisis center from his office, keeping in touch with regional <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> bank presidents across the country to make sure bank credit needs were being met. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> bank examiners were dispatched to the major banks to provide on-the-scene reports. `` <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> managed the stock market crisis with enormous finesse,'' said <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> governor. `` People now say nothing much happened following the market collapse, but that's because the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s skillful handling prevented a total financial meltdown. The move to easier credit had represented an about-face for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, which in the weeks before the market turmoil was actually tightening up on credit. On Sept. 4, after being in office for less than a month, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> oversaw an increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s discount rate to 6 percent, the first time this fee the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> charges to make bank loans had been raised in three years. The sudden increase was seen as a macho signal that <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> intended to be just as tough an inflation-fighter as <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>. But it also opened him to criticism that he had needlessly unnerved already jittery financial markets and had actually contributed to the market's later crash. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> dismisses charges that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s tightening played any role in the market plunge, saying that stocks had become overpriced and the record drop was `` an accident waiting to happen.'' Just Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> announced another increase in the discount rate, to 6.5 percent, saying the action `` reflects the intent of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to reduce inflationary pressures'' and `` was taken in light of the growing spread of market interest rates over the discount rate.'' This year, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been criticized for trying to fine-tune the economy, attempting to keep it on course with repeated, small changes in monetary policy. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> announced that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> slightly eased credit conditions in early January because of worries about possible sluggish growth. Then barely two months later, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> began pushing interest rates back up again because of signs of unexpected economic strength. While the central bank has seldom been successful pursuing a fine-turning strategy, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> supporters say at this advanced stage of the economic recovery, there is little else the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can do. `` We are in the stage of a business cycle where the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has to try to slow the economy down without killing it,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, senior financial economist at <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Greenspan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> also has come under fire for sending confusing signals to the markets about what economic barometers are guiding monetary policy. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has talked about monthly unemployment data and business delivery times. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> follows the credit markets closely and <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> has been a vocal proponent of watching commodity prices for clues on inflation. To make matters worse, in the eyes of critics, <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> officials talked openly about their different preferences, stirring concern that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, lacking <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>'s strong presence, was adrift. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> officials have defended the new candor, pointing out that while different barometers are being watched, the votes on monetary policy are almost always close to unanimous. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> was sufficiently concerned by the criticism, though, that he recommended in private that all <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> officials cool their public comments, which they have done. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, 62, also has moved to assert his independence from the administration, taking extra care lest the markets perceive that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was becoming lax in its inflation-fighting zeal because of political pressures during an election year. While <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> independence is always considered crucial, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> faced particular scrutiny because of his longtime Republican ties. He had served as chairman of President <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION> and headed up a blue-ribbon commission for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> which came up with a rescue for the nearly bankrupt Social Security system in 1983. At one point after a series of perceived attempts by the administration to influence <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> decisions, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> complained publicly and warned that the concerns over political pressure could get `` so extraordinary'' that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would end up taking actions in the opposite direction just to prove its independence. Since that February comment, the administration at the orders of <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has adopted a hands-off approach. So far, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s balancing act of keeping the aging recovery alive while remaining vigilant against inflation is working. The economy is now in its 69th month of expansion, a peacetime record. While being careful to say that the business cycle has not been repealed, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> clearly hopes that he and his <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> colleagues can keep the balancing act going for a while longer. But it would be a real feat if he does not have to deal with a recession at some point before his four-year term ends in 1991. At his swearing-in ceremony a year ago, he joked about all the economic forces that would conspire to make his job easy for him. He took time to thank in advance: `` inflation, which always stays put; the stock market, which is always a bull; the dollar, which is always stable; interest rates, which always stay low, and employment, which stays high.''

 `` Joy'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Elektra </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON> `` Joy'' is a steamy set of soul songs that never overheats, due to the restraint of the tempos, arrangements and <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON>' delivery Even when <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON> sings of `` explosions of ecstacy flowing from you and me'' -LRB- on `` 2 a.m.'' -RRB-, his cooing manner is such that the words would probably slip right past <PERSON> Tipper </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. The song titles _ `` Can We Be Lovers,'' `` I'm Ready,'' `` Love Is the Power'' _ show that <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON> is obsessed with the same thing as <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON> is less overt. The accompaniment steers clear of lead guitars or horns that would clash with <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON>' smooth style. Drums, bass and low-profile keyboards dominate. The closest thing to a frill is three female backup singers; <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON> plays off them when he raps -LRB- briefly enough to avoid being corny -RRB- and when he improvises nicely on the chorus of `` Through the Falling Rain.'' The eight love songs on `` Joy'' are all played at mid-tempo. <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON>' message is clear: this is music for romancing, not dancing. _ By <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wine </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'' -LRB- Sire -RRB- _ <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> The story's so irresistible, you almost want to will it to be true. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, Rock' n' Roll Hall of Fame member and erstwhile <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON>, releases his first solo LP after 20 years of being nearly incapacitated by mental illness. Can the lost genius ever be found? Not really. In one respect, this new album is a triumph. Few people honestly expected <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> to ever again release listenable music of any form, so anything more is gravy. But let's be honest. Despite some pleasant moments, `` <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'' ca n't compare with any of the early'60s Beach Boys classics, nor a lot of other good music happening today. It's a nondescript album that floats by without any songs grabbing hold and shaking out any reaction. Frankly, both the Smithereens and XTC alter-egos <PERSON> Dukes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Stratosphear </LOCATION> have written better <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> tributes in the past year than <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> himself. Back when he was young, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s classic `` In My Room'' spoke universally to teen-agers who occasionally need to escape into themselves and not feel childish about it. But a generation has passed, and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> still has n't left his room. In `` Love and Mercy,'' he talks of `` lyin' in my room'' and seeing `` a lot of people out there hurtin' and it really scares me.'' The prescription, love and mercy, is n't much different from what the <ORGANIZATION> Beatles </ORGANIZATION> suggested 21 years ago. `` Baby Let Your Hair Grow Long'' suggests a troubled girl may cure her problems with an adjustment in grooming. A naivete that seemed charming 25 years ago is less so now. And, musically, what once seemed effortless is now labored. Too many rhythms are ponderous and the <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> touches in the production mostly sound dated. There are some high points: `` Walkin' the Line,'' with the vocal help of <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Arby </PERSON>, is breezy and warm, and `` Meet Me in My Dreams Tonight'' is a pretty fantasy song. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s old Beach Boy mates do n't appear, but the a capella `` One for the Boys'' is a worthy tribute. And the eight-minute concept song, `` <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>,'' is not the disaster that its length and lyrics suggest. No, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> does n't embarrass himself with this effort. But do n't throw away your old Beach Boy albums. _ By <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 Entertainment writers are always informed that Pee-wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> will be interviewed as Pee-wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, the film and television star, not as <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reubens </PERSON>, his real-life identity. How do you deal with that? Would you interview <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> as <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON>? <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> as <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>? How to question Pee-wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>? In squeaks and baby talk? Such questions go through a reporter's mind as he awaits the arrival of the star on a huge, empty Paramount studio stage. He appears at the far end, a tiny figure in the now familiar too-tight suit, hair plastered down, lips pursed. But as he sits down to talk, he is _ sigh _ neither Pee-wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reubens </PERSON>; rather, he's someone in the middle. He has come to talk about `` Big Top Pee-wee,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> release he hoped would repeat the success of the 1985 `` Pee-Wee's Big Adventure'' -LRB- returns so far have been respectable but not overwhelming -RRB-. But he also talked about other matters, presumably as <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reubens </PERSON>. Why a circus movie? `` I grew up in <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, which is the old winter headquarters of the Ringling show,'' he explains. `` I knew a lot of circus people, and I knew of a lot of circus people. My school had a circus that included children of the performers. `` I always wanted to be an aerialist. But they told me I was too scrawny to be a catcher. I thought I might be a clown or acrobat, and I learned to walk the tightrope -LRB- which he does in the film -RRB-. But I got in show business as an actor instead. I always thought if I did n't get successful, I'll give up and join the circus.'' Born <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenfeld </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Peekskill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, in 1952, he grew up in <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> where his parents ran a lamp store. Young <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was a jokester, always putting on shows for the neighbor kids, later graduating to summer stock. After high school he spent a year at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and was then turned down by the <ORGANIZATION> Juilliard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie-Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. So he enrolled at the Disney-endowed <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION>. `` When I first came out -LRB- to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> -RRB-, I thought people would discover you ... then you became a movie star and they figured out a way to keep you a movie star,'' he reflected. `` I had an unrealistic view of what it was all going to be like. When I realized that I was n't going to be one of those people who were discovered, I decided I'd better discover myself.'' When and where was Pee-wee born? `` Difficult question,'' he says cautiously. `` I was part of a comedy group here in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and we had our own theater.'' Let the record show that the theater was The <ORGANIZATION> Groundlings </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Reubens </PERSON> appeared at night while preparing pizzas and selling <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> brushes by day. In 1979, he began developing the character of a would-be comedian who is hopelessly innocent and untalented. Pee-wee came from a one-inch harmonica, <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> from an obnoxious childhood acquaintance. Pee-wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> became a one-hour show he performed for a year at the Roxy theater on the <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, then taped for <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>. `` Late Night With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'' brought him more attention, followed by <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> TV specials and appearances on `` The Tonight Show Starring <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>.'' `` Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' proved that the comedian had wide appeal. He was one of the few who were n't surprised by the film's success `` I was confident. I felt like the script was good, and the director -LRB- <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, who made ` Beatlejuice' -RRB- and the team were good. I had a lot of pride in it. I was more relieved that it was a success, that my feelings were right.'' `` Pee-wee's Playhouse'' began appearing on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> Saturday mornings in the spring of 1987 and has been widely praised for its imagination and entertainment value. Why did he enter children's programming `` I guess my real motivation was CBS begging me to do it. I kept saying, ` No, I do n't want to do it,' and they said ` Please, please do it.' So I decided to give them a break and do it -LRB- giggling -RRB-. `` Really, it just seemed like a fun thing to do. At first we discussed an animated cartoon, which I did n't want to do. Then I told them about a sort of salute to children's shows that was more oriented for adults. It started out as a midnight show that some called a satire; I called it a salute. So I suggested making it a live-action show like the ones I grew up on. They said OK.'' <PERSON> Reubens </PERSON> lapses into <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> when he discusses one of his co-stars in `` Big Top Pee-wee,'' a talking pig `` We had a nation-wide talent search for the pig, and when you do that, you hopefully come out with talent,'' he said. `` I will have to wait for the critics to tell me whether he stole scenes from me. I am a giving actor, and I think he was, too. So we meet evenly somewhere. `` Since I wrote the film, I have the better dialogue, funnier lines. I also get to breathe down the director's neck in the editing room. If the pig was getting too many laughs, then _ snip, snip, snip. Nobody is funnier in a Pee-wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> movie than <PERSON> Pee-Wee </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>.'' He giggles.

<TEXT>
 Time is erasing hundreds of giant artworks from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> buildings, used as canvas during the 1960s and'70s, when muralists transformed gray city landscapes with color and dreams. To <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a public-art pioneer whose murals celebrate heroes of the civil rights movement, the decay goes deeper than the layers of paint on brick and concrete. `` We've lost something very important. We've lost compassion, caring and concern for all _ much of that was expressed in the murals,'' he said. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s powerful `` Wall of Peace and Salvation, Wall of Understanding'' is one of about 200 urban murals splashed across <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. A small movement is under way to save or restore some of the works, but there is little money to support it. The mural was painted by the elevated tracks in the shadow of Cabrini-Green, a public housing project plagued by gang warfare, crime and violence. He chose the site, he said, because the mural concerns choices. Commuters speed past its chipped and peeling images of Nobelist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and slain <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Malcolm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> X </ORGANIZATION>. A youthful <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is there as well. These heroes are contrasted with symbols of death and violence _ the alternatives to a life of peace. The fading images, 4 -LCB- stories tall, still have a haunting presence, though much of their power is gone. `` I think the city is losing part of the civil rights struggle or human rights struggle,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorell </PERSON>, an art history professor at <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Those murals are an index or a signpost of those times.'' Their deterioration represents a loss of `` neighborhood, city and community history,'' <PERSON> Sorell </PERSON> said. Murals are an `` outdoor museum,'' he said, especially in poor communities with fewer ways to preserve history and hope. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> is considered the birthplace of the movement that produced these `` blackboards for the people'' and spread to other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities, especially on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s first outdoor mural, `` The Wall of Respect'' _ created in 1967 with about a dozen other black artists from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> _ is widely acknowledged as the first example of contemporary American community murals. It was destroyed two years later, when fire gutted the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> building that served as the canvas for an 8-foot <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> and other portraits of prominent blacks in entertainment, politics, the arts and religion. Many other works are lost or face destruction by time and the elements, said <PERSON> Sorell </PERSON>, who has published a guide to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s murals `` They most definitely should be refurbished,'' he said. `` The question is: Where will the money come from?'' The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> uses city, state, federal and private funds to sponsor outdoor art work, but channels no money toward preservation, said muralist and group member <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, a professor of art at suburban <ORGANIZATION> Elmhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. The city still funds new public art, preferring to spend resources on more permanent works than on restoring deteriorating murals, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Futris </PERSON>, director of public art for the Department of Cultural Affairs. <PERSON> Aurelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, who spearheaded the public art movement among <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Hispanics, says the city should sponsor restoration of the murals that chronicle the issues and struggles of its people. `` It's not just art, it's a way of recording the history of the people,'' said <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, an artist who works with <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who owns an auto repair shop near a three-block-long <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> work, said neighborhood residents and businesses `` feel proud about these kind of murals. ... It's good for everybody and helps the community improve.'' But <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> is resigned to the loss of his works. `` The Wall of Peace'' served a purpose in its time, he said, but perhaps that time is past. An artist by profession, he has touched up the lower sections of his masterpiece but never succeeded in restoring its original 1970 appearance. `` I'm sad I could n't preserve it any longer, but I did n't have the financing,'' he said. During the late'70s, <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> and city-paid teen-agers painted murals in the <LOCATION> Pilsen </LOCATION> neighborhood, where Spanish is heard more than English and Mexican bakery goods are offered at stands on every block. `` The Legend of <PERSON> Bonampak </PERSON>,'' depicting an ancient Mayan fable, was executed with help from members of different neighborhood street gangs, recalled <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, 31, who emigrated from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 1971. `` The mural gave the kids a way to channel their creative energy,'' he said. It covered years of graffiti and even now, after 11 years, there are only a few gang scrawls on the worn surface, <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said. For years, <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> recalled, `` the gangs would n't touch murals in other people's neighborhoods. One would not see graffiti on a mural.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who stored supplies for <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> and his teen-age crew while they painted the `` <LOCATION> Galeria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrio </LOCATION>,'' still chops down weeds in front of the mural. `` Every week you can see some tourist buses stop to look at it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Venezuela Seeking New Foreign Loans Amid Growing Debt Frustration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARRIE FIGDOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government mission charged with extracting new loans from foreign commercial banks begins its difficult task this week amid <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s growing frustration at its inability to escape from its vicious circle of foreign debt. The team, headed by Finance Minister <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>, will try to convince banks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to lend up to $ 3 billion to cover this year's estimated $ 2.5 billion balance of payments deficit. The discussions could be rocky: as <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> blames its inability to grow out of its economic problems on the weight of the foreign debt, while foreign banks see its problem as one of lax domestic policy. `` We understand that the debt is the Gordian knot of our current -LRB- economic -RRB- situation and we have decided to cut it,'' President <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> stated emphatically in a televised address last week. The balance of payments deficit is the product of continued low oil prices, which could limit income from <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s main export to just $ 8.2 billion this year. Scheduled payments on its $ 34 billion foreign debt, estimated at $ 5 billion this year, will absorb 60 percent of that, severely limiting the nation's prospects for growth in an election year. But the government is equally frustrated by the fact that <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> paid over $ 30 billion in capital and interest between 1983, when its debt problems began, and last year, but its total debt has remained virtually unchanged. Venezuelan officials claim commercial bank creditors have reneged on a promise to provide <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> with new funds and help it regain access to international financial markets. The nation's $ 20.34 billion foreign debt refinancing agreement, first signed in 1986, was revised early in 1987 to allow for more favorable terms _ including a clause in which banks promised to `` look favorably'' upon requests for new loans. But besides an estimated $ 3.5 billion in short-term lines of credit and a $ 100 million issue of Republic of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> bonds, no new balance of payments loans have been made. `` Servicing the foreign debt -LRB- was -RRB- made under the promise that financial flows would be renewed ... -LRB- debt service -RRB- has been an obligation that has limited our possibilities to eradicate our crisis,'' <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> said. The frustration has led to persistent rumors in recent weeks that <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> might declare a unilateral debt payment moratorium, as some government party members want. But <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> and other top administration officials said any suspension of payments would occur only if this week's mission fails, and even then, only in concert with commercial banks. And <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> said before leaving for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last weekend that any new talks to seek more favorable terms on the refinanced debt would begin only after a new administration takes office early next year. `` A temporary suspension of payments -LRB- this year -RRB- is a far-off possibility, but it is a possibility,'' said <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Maza </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON>, a private economist who advises the government on economic policy. But government efforts to control the domestic impact of the debt are showing signs of strain. Due to lack of sufficient income, government spending programs designed to promote growth have been based on internal debt, which has risen to 7 percent of gross domestic product, according to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. The spending resulted in domestic growth of 5 percent in 1986, for the first time in eight years. But growth slowed to 3 percent last year and, according to private estimates, could be flat again this year. Inflation, which the government hoped to limit to 15 percent this year, already had topped 12 percent through July, and private economists estimate it could reach 25 percent by December. And the free market exchange rate for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, an important indicator of local business psychology, zoomed last week to more than 38 bolivars, a record level and nearly three times the official exchange rate. Nevertheless, analysts feel the government has room to adopt policies which would help solve the domestic imbalances, including raising domestic interest rates and increasing fiscal revenues from public services. The financial mission is armed with an outline of possible steps the government could take in return for new cash. Foreign bankers say they probably would require such measures _ which would be similar to austerity guidelines often recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> _ as a condition of any new loans. Foreign bankers also say <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> should look for new money in other places first, which usually means the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. But <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> is unlikely to want to change its policy of avoiding an <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> connection in order to maintain the freedom to set its own economic priorities. `` Politically, for a government ending its term and in an electoral year, -LRB- going to the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- would be very, very difficult,'' said <PERSON> Maza </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON>.

<HEAD>CBS Agrees To Buy Independent TV Station in Miami</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, flush with cash from sale of major non-broadcasting assets, says it plans to look for more prospects in the wake of its agreement to purchase an independent television station in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for $ 59 million. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that its agreement to acquire WCIX-TV from <ORGANIZATION> TVX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, also calls for it to assume certain program obligations, which a CBS spokesman said were valued at about $ 13 million. <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> president, in announcing the deal said `` we are continuing to evaluate other potential properties with an eye toward further acquisitions.'' Financial analysts said the deal seemed good for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, who had been faulted for failing to buy more stations with the $ 3 billion amassed by selling assets such as its records and magazine businesses. On Wall Street, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> stock slipped 12 -LCB- cents a share to $ 162.87 -LCB- on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The purchase of the station, which is subject to regulatory approval, would allow <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> to maintain its presence in the fast-growing <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> television market at only a fraction of the price a network affiliate likely would have commanded. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> is the nation's 16th largest TV market. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was outbid last year in an effort to buy its <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> affiliate, <ORGANIZATION> WTVJ </ORGANIZATION>, by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which offered $ 270 million. <ORGANIZATION> WTVJ </ORGANIZATION> still carries CBS programs under an affiliation agreement that ends in January, when it is expected to become an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> affiliate. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Appert </PERSON>, a media analyst for the investment firm C.J. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> WCIX </ORGANIZATION> purchase `` looks like an excellent deal.'' `` They bought a new network affiliate station for an incredibly low price,'' he said. <PERSON> Appert </PERSON> said independent stations command lower prices because they have higher programming costs, attract smaller audiences and generate lower advertising revenue. Affiliates get some programming from the network and often can charge higher ad rates for programs such as local news that may appear just before network programs, he said. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, media analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said buying an independent station `` might send a dangerous signal'' to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliates who have a competing independent station in their market. `` There might be a risk in any market where there is a VHF independent,'' he said. A VHF station is one operating on Channels 2 through 13. But <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION> KCTV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and a former head of the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliates board, said there were only a handful of markets where that situation existed. `` It sounds to me like it's a smart buy,'' he said. Affiliates had been urging <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> to buy a few stations to demonstrate his commitment to the network. <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> told them he wanted to do so, but that the asking prices were too high. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> owns television stations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> that reach 19.4 percent of the country's viewers. With <ORGANIZATION> WCIX </ORGANIZATION>, its stations would reach 20.8 percent of the country. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s parent has seven stations reaching 22.4 percent of the country; <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has eight stations reaching 24.4 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> regulations limit network companies to owning a maximum of 12 stations reaching 25 percent of the country. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> also announced Monday that <ORGANIZATION> WPEC-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, would become a CBS affiliate in January. The station is now an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> affiliate, and the signing is seen as helping <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> reach an audience north of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> where the <ORGANIZATION> WCIX </ORGANIZATION> signal is weak.

<HEAD>Dollar Steady In Calm European Trading, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar was holding steady in calm European trading late this morning, and traders said they generally expect the market to take a one-day breather before pushing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency higher. Gold prices fell. Traders said there was some light profit-taking following Monday's gain, but that market sentiment still calls for a higher dollar. `` The dollar is fundamentally strong. We could see just a minor decline before it takes off again,'' one <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> trader said. `` We are probably in a phase of rest in anticipation of a new rally.'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound was quoted at $ 1.7050, compared with $ 1.7022 Monday. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.8968 West German marks, down from 1.9000; 1.5850 Swiss francs, down from 1.5857; 6.3975 French francs, up from 6.3950; 2.1403 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1435; 1,399.40 Italian lire, down from 1,399.50; 1.2105 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2097 In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar fell 0.39 yen to a closing 133.58 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted higher at 133.70 yen. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 430.80 a troy ounce, down from late Monday's $ 432.25. At mid-morning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 428.25 In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 428.20, down from $ 432.00 late Monday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 3.39 to close at a bid $ 430.61. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today at a bid price of $ 6.69 a troy ounce, down from Monday's $ 6.78.

 The dollar edged down slightly against the Japanese yen today, while share prices dropped for the third straight day on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. After opening at 133.62 yen, down from Monday's close of 133.97 yen, the dollar remained in a narrow range between 133.52 and 133.73 yen in slow trading. It closed at 133.58 yen, down 0.39 yen from Monday's close. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 109.06-point loser Monday, lost 82.76 points, or 0.29 percent, to close at 28,170.36. Volume traded on the first section of the exchange was a light 650 million shares. The volume has plunged drastically since Monday when it declined to 650 million shares, the first time the daily volume traded fell below 1 billion shares since July 25. Dealers said investors were not active in the market because <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is entering a major holiday season. `` As seen in the low volume, the market is not moving energetically and only limited shares are being traded,'' said a dealer at a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> securities firm, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` This situation will likely continue until mid-August. `` Most foreign fund managers seem to be out of town for vacation and there are not many people left in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> who can move a large amount of funds,'' the dealer added.

<HEAD>Group Says Pollutants, Heat Create More Smog Than A Year Ago</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An environmental organization says smog got worse this year in cities and counties from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, and that while the hot, muggy summer is partly to blame, ozone-producing pollutants are the root cause. `` Obviously, the weather is part of the problem,'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday in an interview. `` But it's not the source. Blaming the weather for high levels of pollution is like blaming the ground for a plane crash. ... `` The smoggy summer of'88 is an unpleasant preview of a dirty, unhealthy future unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> strengthens the Clean Air Act by restricting emissions from motor vehicles and industrial polluters,'' he said. A <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> survey found that through Aug. 3, 41 of 47 cities and counties had peak ozone readings at least 25 percent greater than the safe federal health standard, compared with 36 in this category for all of 1987. The federal health standard for ozone is 0.12 parts per million. Ozone, which causes respiratory problems, is formed when nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons combine in the presence of sunlight. The <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> said the worst reading was 0.24 ppm in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> had a 0.21 ppm reading in 1988, but this was well below its worst 1987 reading of 0.29 ppm, according to the survey. Every city in the survey exceeded 0.12 ppm at least once. Nineteen areas exceeded the standard by 50 percent at least once so far in 1988, up from 14 in 1987, while nine had at least one reading 75 percent higher than the standard, up from four last year, according to the survey. Thirty cities and counties exceeded the air-quality standard more times through Aug. 3 than they had during all of 1987, the survey said. The only western state surveyed, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, actually had better readings than it had in 1987. The four <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cities surveyed _ <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> _ showed improvements over the previous air-quality readings. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> obtained the data through telephone interviews with state and local air pollution control agencies, which he said supply the same monitoring data to the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Love Canal's Next 10 Years Will Be As Important As Its First

<TEXT>
 Ten years after Love Canal was declared a national disaster area because buried chemicals were oozing to the surface, the largely abandoned neighborhood remains at the center of environmental debate. The former chemical dump that forced hundreds of families from their homes has been fenced off and surrounded with clay and plastic liners to prevent chemicals from leaking into groundwater. Corroding drums of chemicals have been separated and complex runoff monitoring and collection systems have been built. But even though the contamination has been largely contained and state officials have begun to talk about restoring the neighborhood to residential use, critics think Love Canal and hundreds of similar sites throughout the nation will remain potential disasters until a safe disposal method is found. `` We've spent the first 10 years catching up on the sins of the past,'' acknowledged <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, who noted that the discovery of Love Canal's threat was largely responsible for federal toxic waste cleanup legislation. `` The future will have to be spent changing industrial processes and people's attitudes about waste generation,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. `` In many ways the next 10 years will be more important than the first.'' Love Canal, an abandoned waterway project, was used by the <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to dispose of thousands of pounds of chemical wastes in the 1940s. <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> made herbicides and pesticides. In the 1950s, the canal and its contents were covered and homes and an elementary school were built. It was n't until the early 1970s that people began to notice foul smells in their basements and oily puddles in their yards. They also began to notice higher-than-usual incidences of miscarriages, birth defects, cancer, leukemia, neurological disease, allergies, epilepsy and suicides. But government was slow to react. It took mass protests and town meetings turned into near riots to prod the state into action. On Aug. 7, 1978, President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> declared a state of emergency at Love Canal. Eventually, 728 homes in a 50-block area were evacuated and the elementary school and 228 of the houses were torn down. The state and federal governments filed multimillion-dollar lawsuits against <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>. The cases are still being pursued against the company's parent, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Today, inside the fenced dump, crews in protective suits carry out small projects to shore up containment walls or check monitoring wells Outside the fence, houses are boarded up and decaying. A few are still inhabited. `` We always hoped they'd decide that it was safe to live here and that things would return to normal one day,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, a retiree who stayed in his house two blocks from the dump site. Some 175 other families are awaiting the results of a state habitability study before returning. State Health Commissioner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> is to decide the habitability question this fall. If <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> determines that the area is habitable, the state will have to assume liability for those who return, said former resident <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, now a Washington-based environmental activist. `` Will the deeds carry health warning labels?'' she said. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said environmental groups would sue to block resettlement, arguing that no one knows what levels of exposure to the chemicals are safe. If Love Canal is declared unsafe, it would set a precedent for people living around toxic waste dumps nationwide. The cost of relocating those people and cleaning those dumps would be astronomical, she said. The state, however, has vowed not to leave <LOCATION> Love </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> a vacant field as a symbol of environmental disaster. `` We have a vision of Love Canal as a usable landscape again,'' state Environmental Conservation Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorling </PERSON> said recently. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said habitability decisions are being made across the country, though none are of the same magnitude as Love Canal. `` No situation is risk free,'' he said. `` You ca n't expect to be part of a highly developed, industrial society without weighing risks and ultimately living with them.''

<TEXT>
 A defense lawyer for <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> says there's no evidence that the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil tycoon and his two brothers were part of a plot to corner the world silver market nearly 10 years ago. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> and his two younger brothers are being sued for $ 150 million by a South American silver concern that claims the Dallas-based Hunts manipulated the world silver market between 1979 and 1980. In his closing argument to the jury Monday at federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> noted that the Hunts lost more than $ 1 billion when the silver market collapsed in 1980. `` Where is the evidence they made a profit?'' <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> asked the six-member civil jury. `` If they were part of a conspiracy, it was one spectacular failure.'' The Hunts' <ORGANIZATION> Placid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and their three individual trusts, which control <ORGANIZATION> Penrod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drilling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, are in bankruptcy proceedings. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> said the Hunts were victims just like other silver investors. `` They believed too much in silver. They played and they paid,'' said <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, a mineral marketing company owned by the Peruvian government, claims in a federal civil action that the brothers _ <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 62; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 59, who also has extensive real estate holdings, and <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 56, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> _ conspired unsuccessfully with several <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> businessmen to corner the world silver market. The trial before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> began in February. Lawyers for Minpeco claim the Hunts and their Middle Eastern co-defendants were responsible for the sharp rise in silver prices from about $ 9 an ounce to more than $ 50 an ounce between September 1979 and January 1980. <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON> had a large short position in the silver futures market, which meant it would make money on dropping silver prices and lose money on rising prices. <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON> claimed it lost more than $ 100 million due to skyrocketing silver prices that fell back to about $ 10 an ounce in March 1980. Six financial institutions accused of participating in the alleged conspiracy have settled with <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON> for a total of $ 64.6 million.

<HEAD>London Shares Lower At Midday In Quiet Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices were a bit lower across the board around midday Tuesday, with speculative activity providing the only excitement to an otherwise dull market. `` There is just very little business around in the market,'' one dealer said. `` Everybody's got flat books and no one cares which way the market goes.'' The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 2.9 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,873.1 at about 12:30 p.m., just 0.3 point below its best level for the day. The index fluctuated in negative territory all morning, moving down as much as 7.3 points at one point. Volume was a light 222.1 million shares at midday, compared with 189.3 million shares at the same time Monday. A half-point increase in the British commercial banks' base lending rate to 11 percent on Monday, which had n't been expected and was the seventh rise since early June, apparently made investors reluctant to continue buying shares. At the same time, there was little selling pressure, dealers said. With activity in most stocks sharply reduced, attention turned to speculative situations, giving a boost to selected shares, they said.

<HEAD>Japanese Company First Foreign Firm to Lease Land in China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Japanese company on Monday became the first foreign firm to `` buy'' land from the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government in public tender bidding. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> news agency said <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> beat out five other firms to win rights to use a 12,900-square-meter -LRB- 139,320-square-foot -RRB- plot in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hongqiao </LOCATION> economic development zone for 50 years The report said the company will pay 104.16 million yuan -LRB- $ 28 million -RRB- for the land. It plans to construct apartment and office buildings, restaurants, stores and recreational facilities there. The selling of land-use rights is the latest, and one of the more controversial, measures taken by the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government to raise badly needed capital for economic development. Last month the city of <LOCATION> Shenzhen </LOCATION>, a special economic zone across the border from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, held <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first land auction, with two Chinese companies winning the bidding for property development sites. Land in socialist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> technically all belongs to the state, but economists are now arguing that a market in land-use rights will bring in needed capital, bring about a more efficient use of land and speed up urban development. In the countryside, family farms that were rehabilitated with the start of agricultural reforms in 1979 usually have 10 - to 15-year contracts for farming a plot of land, but normally do not pay rent to the state In the cities, most Chinese factories and buildings occupy land without charge for unlimited periods. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature, paved the way for land-use sales last April when it amended the constitution to eliminate a prohibition against leasing land and added the sentence `` land-use rights according to legal regulation can be transferred.'' Some rural areas now allow residents not using their land to lease it to more ambitious farmers needing larger tracts. The government at the end of last year also named seven urban areas that may experiment with land-use sales: <LOCATION> Shenzhen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fuzhou </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Xiamen </LOCATION>. Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, however, stressed recently that public ownership will remain dominant in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. His statement appeared to be meant to assuage other party leaders worried that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was losing its socialist character with the emergence of thriving private enterprises and the selling of state land.

 The owners of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> praised the attorney general's decision to allow a partial merger of the newspapers, while employees toasted their reprieve from `` death row.'' Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> on Monday granted the newspapers' application to combine their business, production and circulation departments. He said without a partial merger, the Free Press, the nation's 10th-largest newspaper in terms of circulation, could not stem the losses that had brought it to the brink of failure. `` Keen competition aimed at market domination and future profitability _ competition waged energetically but both responsibly and properly _ has moved both newspapers into intractable loss positions from which only one, the News, now appears to have any reasonable prospect of emerging,'' said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who is scheduled to leave office in mid-August. Directors of <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, had threatened to close the newspaper unless <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> approved the joint operating agreement. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s News, the nation's eighth-largest newspaper, had a daily circulation lead of about 40,000 in `` This decision reaffirms the will of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that two independent editorial voices should be preserved wherever possible in the cities of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Alvah </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> chairman. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuharth </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> said they, too, were gratified. `` We said all along that the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> was the only way to preserve two independent news and editorial voices,'' they said in a statement from <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` The attorney general's decision is in the best interest of the community, the readers, the advertisers and the employees.'' Free Press employees toasted the decision with champagne in plastic cups. `` It was like a rush. Waiting for the decision is like living on death row,'' said Senior Managing Editor <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Shine </PERSON>, who had been assigned to write the newspaper's obituary if the partial merger had been denied. The Newspaper Guild Local 22, which was the last union to formally drop its opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> after it gained improved economic terms, was still critical of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision. `` This is a travesty of the Newspaper Preservation Act,'' said <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Mleczko </PERSON>, a reporter at the News and president of the union, which has 1,100 members at the two newspapers. `` I feel it would have been an extraordinary tragedy if this paper died,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, publisher of the 157-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> rejected recommendations by the department's antitrust division and by an administrative law judge that the agreement be turned down. They had concluded that the newspapers' losses resulted from pricing decisions and could be reduced if the newspapers raised prices to cover the cost of operating. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, however, said the Free Press, with a 20-cent newsstand price in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area, already was 5 cents higher than the News'. `` There is thus no competitive advantage to be gained by <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> from a unilateral increase in prices,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. The joint operating agreement was the fifth approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> under the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970, which allows limited antitrust exemption to preserve independent editorial voices in a community where one newspaper is in danger of failing. Previous partial mergers were approved for newspapers in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, in 1974, <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> in 1979, <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, in 1980 and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> in 1982. Under the 100-year joint operating agreement, the Free Press will publish on weekday mornings and the News on weekday afternoons. The newspapers will split responsibilities on weekends, when a combined edition called `` The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and Free Press'' will be published. The agreement means a maximum 500 people at both papers could loose their jobs, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said. A significant number have indicated they will take early retirement, helping to hold down the layoffs, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said. Profits or losses the first five years of the agreement will be split under a sliding formula, beginning with 55 percent for <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> and 45 percent for <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>. Thereafter, profits and losses will be split equally between the two corporations. According to estimates released by <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> in January, the Free Press' operating losses had totaled $ 100 million since 1979, and that the News had lost about $ 75 million in the same period. The Free Press circulation in March was 647,763 daily and 721,676 on Sundays, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circulation </ORGANIZATION>. The News' circulation was 688,211 daily and 836,331 on Sundays, the bureau said. The Free Press was founded in 1831 and purchased by a predecessor of <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> in 1940. The News was founded in 1873 and purchased by <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> in 1986.

 The stock market moved sharply lower today in reaction to news that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> boosted its key bank lending rate, but then recovered somewhat. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell about 23 points following the announcement, was off 10.66 at 2,096.73 in the first half hour of trading. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 346 issues up, 469 down and 585 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 56.49 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> announced it was hiking the discount rate to 6.5 percent from 6 percent shortly after the market opened. The increase, which traders had been anticipating, marks the first change in the rate since Sept. 7 and put the rate at its highest in more than two years. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement, said its decision `` reflects the intent of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to reduce inflationary pressures'' and `` was taken in light of the growing spread of market interest rates over the discount rate.'' The boost is expected to send a variety of other interest rates higher, including those on credit cards and mortgages. Analysts said they expected an initial selloff following the news but were cautiously optimistic that the market could weather the increase. `` Since last week's unemployment figures, we've been hearing the drumbeat that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would have to tighten,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, first vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Now we'll wait to see whether the Street prepared for it.'' Last week the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported better-than-expected employment data for July and also revised June data upward.

With the dollar was up sharply on the announcement, analysts predicted more foreign funds will shift into dollar-denominated instruments and support stocks and bonds While analysts had expected the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to tighten its reins on the money supply this week, few expected a change in the discount rate, which is the most dramatic move the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can take.

 Grain and soybean futures opened mostly higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to a private crop analyst's prediction of a sharp drop in corn and soybean production.

Although traders are eagerly awaiting the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report, which will be based crop conditions as of Aug. 1, the official numbers may have little market impact, said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leow </PERSON>, an assistant vice president in charge of grain futures trading at <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` When the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> comes out with its number, people are most likely going to say it's too high because the survey was taken prior to the extreme heat we experienced last week,'' Ms. <PERSON> Leow </PERSON> said. In early trading, wheat was 3 cents to 4 cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.80 a bushel; corn was 2 -LCB- cents to 3 cents higher with September at $ 2.99 a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with September at $ 2.74 a bushel; and soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents to 14 cents higher with August at $ 8.54 a bushel. Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .30 cent to .40 cent higher with August at 68.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .43 cent higher with August at 79.60 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent lower to .30 cent higher with August at 45.67 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .10 cent lower to 1 cent higher with August at 33.15 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Monday.

 At the end of a dusty, mile-long road to nowhere, <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> walk across a field to their barn each morning and generate their harvest by hand. You can probably find their `` produce'' at your corner bookstore. The <ORGANIZATION> Robertsons </ORGANIZATION>, who left urban pressures behind 14 years ago for the solitude of rural <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, are living out their dreams with tiny but highly regarded <ORGANIZATION> Yolla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bolly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` People are fascinated by the fact that two grownups would be out in the woods making books by hand by 19th-century methods,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. The wonderment is natural for any visitor making the 175-mile trek from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Round </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, a remote farming plateau tucked amid the mountains of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Coast Ranges. Thirty miles from the nearest town of any size and almost an hour from a major highway, <ORGANIZATION> Yolla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bolly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> sits next to pasture land in a spot better suited for a sheep barn than a printing barn. The <ORGANIZATION> Robertsons </ORGANIZATION> call it their `` book farm.'' `` I had a dream long ago about a print shop in a garden, and <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> had a dream about a cabin in the woods,'' explained <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, 53. `` We care deeply about books and are devoting our lives to them.'' The press was christened with an Indian name meaning `` high snowy peak,'' for the 8,000-foot mountains of the nearby Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness. Its logo is an Indian design commemorating the tree frog, which frequents the <ORGANIZATION> Robertsons </ORGANIZATION>' 40 acres along with mountains lions, bears and the deer that nap daily in the shade of their guest cabin. The choice of a distinctive name was meant to catch the attention of bookworms and the publishing community. It has. Only about two dozen book printers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> use the letterpress printing method _ pressing raised-surface type onto paper _ instead of the less costly, more modern offset method. Experts say <PERSON> Yolla </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolly </PERSON>, which also produces trade books for commercial publishers, compares favorably with any maker of finely printed books. `` They're absolutely among the country's top producers of fine, limited-edition books _ books that are a combination of craft, art and literature,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirshenbaum </PERSON>, editor of Fine Print, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> quarterly magazine. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> got an early start in the profession. Fascinated by print shops as a boy growing up in <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, he received a tiny, hand-operated press and a case of type from his father one birthday. By the seventh grade, he was running a neighborhood newspaper called `` The <ORGANIZATION> Pearl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>'' _ circulation 15 or 20. He went on to run a graphic-design business for about 15 years before returning to publishing. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON>, 46, grew up a book lover in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. With a background in English literature and business management, she applied for work in <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> office one day in 1968 and got the job and more. Ultimately they founded <PERSON> Yolla </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolly </PERSON> five years later, before moving to <LOCATION> Covelo </LOCATION> in 1974 in the interest of peace, quiet and affordability. Today, <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> handles the business side, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> is responsible for the printing and they share editing and design responsibilities. `` We live on the edge'' in a `` wild and wonderful place,'' is how <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> describes their remote, idyllic setup. <PERSON> Yolla </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolly </PERSON> runs on equipment valued at a mere $ 25,000 _ four letterpresses dating back 75 years, two hand-operated proofing presses and one small offset press. But the two or three fine books produced each year command premium prices from collectors. The most recent was `` My First Summer in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION>,'' commemorating the 150th anniversary of naturalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Muir </PERSON>'s birthday last April The press published 110 limited-edition volumes for $ 785 each, and 25 special-edition volumes for $ 1,150. Months of preparation includes choosing the artist and preparing the art, buying high-quality paper from mills in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and choosing <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> latigo saddle leather or perhaps Amish horse denim for the binding. The price restricts the audience for the limited-edition books by <PERSON> Muir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffers </PERSON> and others. But the care that goes into making them ensures they are likely to be kept for a long time. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> sees books as `` icons'' that represent what is valued in a culture. `` You can make a thing _ a book or a house or a camera _ in such a way that it commands respect,'' he said. `` I hate to think that the only people who care about the way things are made are a couple of oddball craftsmen out in the woods. The culture needs the attitude of making things with purpose, attention to detail and a certain kind of love.'' Because the printing of fine books can be a risky business, <PERSON> Yolla </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolly </PERSON> also acts as an independent producer for four or five commercial books a year. It does the design and preparation work and ships the books off to major publishers such as <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Houghton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mifflin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; best-selling <ORGANIZATION> Yolla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bolly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION> include `` Mountain Light,'' `` The View From The Oak'' and `` Stranger in the Forest.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Robertsons </ORGANIZATION> hope to continue their mix of artistic and commercial work as long as readers keep buying. `` We consider ourselves very lucky to live in a place like this, do the things we care about and make a living,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Crocodile </PERSON> <PERSON> Dundee </PERSON> might prefer to knock back a beer, but wine drinkers around the world are toasting their fascination with life Down Under by sipping more Australian wine than ever before. The explosion of interest in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s premium labels has resulted in some shortages and higher prices, as vintners struggle to keep pace with rising demand both here and overseas. Frost and hailstorms in some parts of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> prior to the 1988 vintage also have cut into supplies. `` Many Australians are drinking better quality wine,'' said leading wine writer <PERSON> Huon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooke </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> Morning Herald. `` They want quality product, but much of that product is committed overseas.'' Contributing to the popularity of Aussie wines is the general bull market for things Australian, including actor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> and his carefree Crocodile Dundee character. Ironically, <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> can be seen in American television commercials, turning up his nose to fine wine tasting in favor of a frothy glass of beer. Also aiding the Australian industry is a trend away from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> wines after the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear disaster sparked fears of fallout across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and scandals over illegal additives scarred the Austrian wine industry. Statistics show domestic consumers are drinking a better class of wine and deserting the taditional cask, or boxed wine. Wine sales in a country previously noted for its beer drinking have doubled over the past decade to 329 million liters last year. The increased popularity of premium wines has led to price rises of up to 30 percent locally and arguments from Australian retailers that producers should supply the local market ahead of the lucrative export markets of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The winemakers, looking to the future, are continuing to export enthusiastically. Australian wine is a competitor for Californian wine in many markets. It is particularly popular in northern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, accounting for 10 percent of all wine imports into <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> _ 7 million liters in the 1986-87 financial year. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> imported 4.5 million liters that year, and the figure is expected to rise considerably in 1987-88. The Australian Wine and <ORGANIZATION> Brandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the government-funded marketing authority, said exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> were up 62 percent last year to 2.7 million liters. `` Dollar for dollar we offer the best value quality wine available around the world,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuigan </PERSON>, managing director of the high-profile <ORGANIZATION> Wyndham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Australian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> reports that wine exports now total over 30 million liters annually, almost 10 percent of the total production. `` We are having great difficulty in meeting the demand for our wines,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, director of trading for Penfolds, which makes Grange Hermitage, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s world-class red wine. Penfolds is the largest winemaking group in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and the largest exporter. Grapes have been grown in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> since the first fleet of convict settlers arrived from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in 1788. The industry has been revolutionized over the past 20 years with the introduction of new technology, which led to the production of high-quality table wines. `` But there is a great deal of resentment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>,'' warned <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Anstee </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Lindemans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` Dealers feel they are being cheated, having made an initial investment in promoting Australian wine and being told <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> can not meet the demand.'' That echoes complaints at home. `` Countries like <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> are ready to service our consumers if the local industry ca n't meet local demands,'' said <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, a buyer for a bulk distribution company. Industry analysts predict the under-supply of premium products, which retail from around $ 5 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domestically, could last for three to four years. They also predict exports could rise to 25 percent of production within five years. But some experts in the industry believe the current premium shortage will be short-lived and has been aggravated by the unusual weather. `` We have better, cheaper land here than anywhere in the northern hemisphere and our production costs are less,'' said <PERSON> McGuigan </PERSON>. `` The current shortage, mainly of Chardonnay, is a temporary aberration. With the potential we have, we ca n't afford to stand still. We are the world's vineyard of the future.'' There are now some 500 wineries spread across the country. Among the premier wine-producing districts are the <LOCATION> Barossa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Clare </PERSON> valleys and <ORGANIZATION> McLaren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vale </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Yarra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Hunter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. There are numerous other small areas where grapes are grown. Despite tight supplies, some winemakers believe now is the time to cultivate new customers. The <ORGANIZATION> Rosemount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, headed by former international winemaker of the year <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, has set up offices in <LOCATION> Ignacio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and is currently exporting to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, among others. `` <LOCATION> Rosemount </LOCATION> is actively pursuing export markets,'' said managing director <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, managing director of the <ORGANIZATION> Ryecroft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, believes there are still huge opportunities for Australian makers, particularly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> market. `` People overseas rarely know if they are eating Australian beef, or wearing Australian wool, but our wine is seen as an Australian product,'' said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. `` It is an ambassador in a glass.''

The commission last year ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to divest itself of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> after the rejection of that railroad's merger with the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> Fe Southern reached agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, but when permission for the sale was sought from the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> objected and sought to buy <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> as well. In a series of votes today, the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> turned its back on the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> proposal and approved the sale to <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Industries </LOCATION> instead. Meanwhile, a three-judge court is scheduled to meet Friday in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to consider <ORGANIZATION> KCSI </ORGANIZATION>'s application for a stay of a recent order barring the company from completing its efforts to purchase <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Eighth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pasco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bowman </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> told attorneys in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that when a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> judge Friday prohibited the company from buying <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, he also delayed the prohibition from taking effect until after it could be appealed. <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>'s observation came after a short hearing Monday morning. He said a temporary stay on the prohibition, preventing it from taking effect, was to last until next Tuesday. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, last week blocked <ORGANIZATION> KCSI </ORGANIZATION> from buying <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>.

But <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> officials say the purchase would enhance the value of their company, rather than harm it. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> won the judgment in a suit alleging <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> helped kill a $ 3.8 billion coal-slurry pipeline that would have helped the state's economy. The state contended <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> worked against the project because it would have hurt the railroad's business.

<HEAD>Unfair Competition Domestically</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Unfair competition of late has become associated with trade restrictions that limit access of American manufacturers to foreign markets. But it is n't always so. You do n't need to leave these shores to find it; unfair practices occur with regularity on the domestic business scene, sometimes with the blessing of high government officials. Potentially, one of the biggest such scrapes of all involves three of the nation's biggest institutions, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In a blistering complaint to government, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> asserts that the federal government, among other things, held it to a higher set of standards than required of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, which helped <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> bid lowest to win a $ 3.6 billion contract. After the award, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it discovered the government allowed <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> to include used computer equipment in its bid while telling <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> it could use only new equipment. Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> challenged a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service award to <ORGANIZATION> Perot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> involving a quest for postal savings that would be made by <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> over a 10-year period. The reason: The award was made without bidding. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has won the first round in that battle, with the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> ruling the award was granted to <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> `` in the face of clear knowledge that other companies existed with competency in this sort of work.'' In the past, the combatants in such disputes over government contracts often involved big companies vs. small, with the latter charging that government specifications put small businesses at a disadvantage. Legislation has alleviated much of the problem, but some small-business organizations still contend that specifications, such as for quantities of a product or delivery times, still put them at a disadvantage. An area of continued friction involves tax-exempt, non-profit organizations such as museums and universities that compete with small businesses in the commercial marketplace. This competition may be getting worse, and could result in legislation. It arises partly from the fact that since 1946, non-profits have increased from about 100,000 to more than 860,000, and from growing financial pressures on many of these institutions. It manifests itself in myriad ways: In a museum that publishes a slick magazine; a college bookstore that sells apparel, furniture or travel services; a hospital that operates a pharmacy, gift shop or health spa. While this competition between profit-seeking and non-profit operations seems to be growing more intense, the definitions that separate them seem insufficient to the purpose. As they exist, the tax laws allow a non-profit organization to engage in commercial activities not subject to taxes if the activities are `` substantially related'' to the purpose of the non-profit institution. Such wording, it is argued, is more an invitation to lawyers and suits, than a guide for business. Operators of small businesses complain that the ability of non-profits to exist without justifying themselves financially gives them an enormous competitive advantage, which is then compounded by their freedom from taxes. Adding to the frustration, they say, is `` halo effect'' of non-profits, or the widespread perception among the public that non-profits, by their very nature, have qualities superior to commercial operations.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> announced today it is boosting its key bank lending rate from 6 percent to 6.5 percent, raising the possibility that other interest rates, including those on credit cards and mortgages, will go higher too. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement, said its decision `` reflects the intent of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to reduce inflationary pressures'' and `` was taken in light of the growing spread of market interest rates over the discount rate.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials were disappointed by the action. It was the first change in the central bank's discount rate since Sept. 4 and put the rate at its highest in more than two years. The increase, effective immediately, set the discount rate, which is the fee the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> charges to make loans to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial institutions, at its highest level since April 21, 1986, when it fell to 6.5 percent from 7 percent. Analysts had expected the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to tighten its reins on the money supply this week, but few were expecting an increase in the discount rate, which is the most dramatic move the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can take. Most were expecting the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to push up the federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, by an eighth or a quarter of a percentage point from its current 7.75 percent. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, consulting firm, said he had not expected a discount rate increase from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> board, all appointees of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, until after the November elections. But, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> acted now rather than in the fall, when the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential campaign of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is in full swing. `` I think the timing is very deliberate to do it before the Republican convention. That's sort of the kick off for the Republican political ampaign and raising the discount rate now may be seen as better than interrupting the campaign,'' <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said the White House was `` naturally ... disappointed.'' But he also told reporters: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has had the task of trying to balance the resistance to inflationary pressures with maintenance of real growth in the economy. ... We believe the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has been doing a good job of balancing these interests.'' The likely negative effects of the hike include pushing up the value of the dollar, which could slow the improvement of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said. The dollar has been appreciating against foreign currencies since early this year and now stands at an 18-month high against the West German mark. It was the previous fall in the value of the dollar that shrank the trade deficit. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> also said that the increase now will likely make government borrowing this week more costly. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in its quarterly auctions, plans to sell $ 11 billion in 10-year notes today and $ 11 billion in three-year notes on Wednesday. Tuesday's discount rate increase marked the second under the reign of <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, who took over as <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman a year ago. In September, the central bank boosted the rate from 5.5 percent to 6 percent, the first increase in three years. That move was also taken in response to inflationary fears, but was later cited by some analysts as a contributing factor to the October stock market crash. After the crash, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> pumped liquidity into the banking system. It loosened money supplies again in mid-winter, when rising business inventories raised concern that the economy was softening. Since then, however, government statistics have portrayed a strong economy and concern has shifted from recession to inflation. Tight labor markets in some areas of the country has been sparking worry about inflationary increases in wages. Some economists say steadily rising factory operating rates are likely to contribute to rising prices for manufactured goods. Last month, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said in congressional testimony that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> `` at this juncture might be well advised to err more on the side of restrictiveness rather than of stimulus.'' At that hearing, before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on July 13, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> had played down the prospect of an immediate increase in the discount rate after he was asked if he were worried about the growing gap between the discount rate and the federal funds rate, which had been increased in a series of small steps since late March. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> replied that `` current relationships are satisfactory'' and noted that the spread had been greater in the past. Too great a spread between the rates tempts banks to misuse the `` discount window'' by borrowing from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and lending to other banks. In its statement today, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said it increased the discount rate in response to requests from <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. As inflationary concerns have mounted in financial markets, other interest rates, including mortgage rates, have been increasing. The prime rate, the rate charged by banks to their most creditworthy customers, was raised by most major banks on July 14 from 9 percent to 9.5 percent, its highest since March 1986. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said a further increase in the prime rate could come this week. Among the recent signs of strength in the economy was the July unemployment rate, which at 5.4 percent was near its 14-year lows. In addition, the monthly trade deficits for April and May were the lowest in nearly three years. Prior to September, the last increase in the discount rate had come April 6, 1984, when the rate was boosted from 8.5 percent to 9 percent. The rate was then cut seven successive times, with the last reduction on Aug. 20, 1986, when it dropped from 6 percent to 5.5 percent, the lowest level in nearly a decade.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will sign the $ 3.9 billion drought relief bill after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> gives final approval to it, the White House announced today. `` Farmers now know that assistance is on the way,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in confirming <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s expected approval. The announcement was unusual, since the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ordinarily does not say what action the president will take on a bill until after it has reached his desk. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said plans were not complete, but a ceremony would probably be held in connection with the signing of the bill. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gave its assent Monday on a 92-0 vote. Just a few minutes earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> cleared the way for expedited consideration of the measure, which could come as early as today. `` There's no question about passage,'' Rep. <PERSON> Kika </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. `` It's just by how many votes.'' The measure _ the biggest federal emergency relief bill ever passed for farmers _ is aimed at the hundreds of thousands of farmers and ranchers who have been buffeted by one of the worst droughts in the nation's history. Growers in the Eastern cornbelt and the Northern plains have been hit particularly hard. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, 43 percent of the country was suffering from severe or extreme drought in mid-July, the fourth worst percentage since the government began keeping the statistics in 1895. The highest measurement was made in 1934, when 61 percent of the nation's area was similarly parched. The government estimated last month that the country's corn crop will be down from a normal year by 29 percent, barley production down 42 percent, oats down 43 percent and spring wheat down 51 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that the government's regular farm payments would be about $ 7 billion lower than expected this year _ not including the cost of this bill _ because of the drought Supporters of the legislation say those savings will more than pay for the costs of the assistance. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is expected to sign the bill quickly. <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> officials say they believe it will take about two months for the assistance to reach the farmers. Governors from farm states, meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> conference in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, unanimously approved a resolution Monday praising <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the quick action `` The legislation that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is set to pass is excellent, far-reaching legislation that provides assistance to livestock and crop producers,'' the resolution by the governors<ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said. The legislation would let growers who lose up to 35 percent of their crops because of the drought keep the `` deficiency payments'' they have already received in advance. Normally, they have to repay the government if crop prices rise, as they have because of the drought. Farmers losing more than 35 percent of their crop would be entitled to an emergency payment of 65 percent of their expected federal subsidy or of the anticipated market price of the crop, up to $ 100,000. Those farmers, however, would have to repay their advance deficiency payments. Farmers would receive aid covering 90 percent of their drought-caused damage for all losses they suffer beyond three-fourths of their crop. Farmers who raise food animals, such as livestock and poultry, would get federal help in paying for up to half the costs of replacement feed bought during the drought if they normally grow their own. The dry weather has driven up the prices of grain that farmers must feed their herds. The measure would not provide assistance to food animal producers who normally buy their feed, rather than raising their own. The government would be allowed to sell its own low-cost feed to farmers, donate feed to producers unable to buy it and reimburse farmers for up to half of some of their feed transportation costs and their expenses for deepening their wells. Dairy price-support levels would be raised in April through June 1989 by 50 cents, to $ 11.10, for each 100 pounds of milk. A 50-cent reduction in the price support, planned for Jan. 1, would be abandoned. The secretary of agriculture would be empowered to begin a program for aiding producers of ethanol, a fuel additive, by permitting them to buy cheaper, government-owned corn. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would be allowed to make 12 million bushels of corn available for the program. To help the government recoup the costs of future farm problems, the bill would require farmers to buy federal crop insurance for 1989 if their losses this year exceed 65 percent of their normal crops. The bill also has provisions encouraging soil and water conservation, and providing aid to farmers harmed by recent hail storms and hurricanes.

 The stock market held at sharply lower levels today after falling in reaction to news that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> boosted its key bank lending rate. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 26.67 at 2,080.73 by midafternoon. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 14 to 3 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 266 issues up, 1,167 down and 465 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume, augmented by dividend-related moves and computer-triggered sell programs, came to 158.81 million shares as of 2 p.m. on Wall Street. The market slipped shortly after the opening when the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> announced it was hiking the discount rate to 6.5 percent from 6 percent. The increase marks the first change in the rate since Sept. 7 and puts the rate at its highest level in more than two years. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said its decision, which could be mimicked by other interest rates like those on credit cards and mortgages, `` reflects the intent ... to reduce inflationary pressure.'' Analysts expected an initial selloff following the news but were cautiously optimistic that the market could digest the increase in a matter of days. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON>, a technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said that there was n't any panic selling going on, although portfolios were being realigned and consolidated. A few investors took the opportunity to hunt for bargains and even looked on the news as positive. `` The feeling is that the sooner the medicine is administered, the quicker the patient will recover,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, vice president and technical anlayst at <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. With the dollar was up sharply on the announcement, analysts predicted more foreign funds will shift into dollar-denominated instruments like stocks and bonds While analysts had expected the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to tighten its reins on the money supply this week, few expected the change would come in the discount rate, which is the most dramatic move the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can take. Most thought the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would push up the federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans. <PERSON> Metz </PERSON> said, however, that the action enhances the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s credibility among those who thought the central bank would refrain from making any decisive moves before November's presidential election Traders were keeping a sharp eye on the credit markets, where the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year bond was off about $ 7.50 per $ 1,000 in face value. Among actively traded <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> issues, <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> fell -RRB- to 31 -LCB- with more than 51 million shares changing hands as traders moved to capture the company's dividend.

<HEAD>Federal Charges Brought Against Accused Teen-aged Hacker</HEAD>

 Prosecutors have accused a teen-ager who dropped out of high school with using his home computer to steal more than $ 1 million in software from <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and the government, and they plan go after other violators. `` This is not malicious mischief,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> in announcing the federal charges on Monday. `` It's a felony.'' Charges brought against <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, signal the start of `` an aggressive position toward computer crimes,'' <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. The government also accused the young man of advertising on a computer bulletin board how to electronically break into <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's computers He was charged in a criminal information. <PERSON> Zinn </PERSON> is accused of committing the crimes when he was a juvenile, and could be sent to prison until his 21st birthday in August 1991. He could not be reached Tuesday at his North Side residence, where his telephone went unanswered. Federal agents raided his home last year and confiscated three computers and software allegedly stolen during the electronic break-ins, and <PERSON> Zinn </PERSON> has not pursued his computer techniques `` with quite the same vim and vigor,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION>. He said he nonetheless hoped eventually to resume his schooling and become an electonics engineer, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Zinn </PERSON> would not discuss details of the case, it said. The federal charges arose after <PERSON> Zinn </PERSON> had been arrested several times, including for allegedly breaking into the computers at the <ORGANIZATION> Keller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> and at <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perspective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, both in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Before and after the computer break-ins -LRB- at <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> and Commodity Perspective -RRB-, <PERSON> Zinn </PERSON> was, by his own admission, breaking into <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T computers,'' <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s said Tuesday its profits soared 34 percent in the second quarter, while <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which remained mired in the year-old apparel industry slump, said its earnings dropped 46 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> has been one of the few standouts in the struggling retail industry. The discount store chain said it earned $ 179.6 million, or 32 cents a share, in the quarter ended July 31, up from $ 134.1 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier. The company's sales increased in the latest quarter to $ 4.85 billion from $ 3.73 billion. Retail sales have fallen off over the past year in part because of women's disenchantment with fashions, but also because consumers have been trying to pay down their installment debt levels. Industry analysts say <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> consistently outperforms other retailers because of its competitive pricing. The company also has an efficient cost structure, enabling it to turn a large profit. Limited said its second-quarter earnings totaled $ 30.7 million, or 17 cents a share, down from $ 57.2 million, or 30 cents a share, in the same 1987 period. The apparel retailer's sales reached $ 893.1 million during the quarter, up from $ 822.1 million. Limited Chairman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wexner </PERSON> said the company anticipated relatively poor results and had kept its inventories at 1987 levels and controlled the markdowns that have eroded apparel retailers' earnings for a year Industry analysts believe the retailers will see signs of a recovery in the third quarter. Limited operates 3,252 specialty apparel stores under the names Limited, Express, <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>'s Secret, <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> <PERSON> Woman </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Abercrombie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON>. It distributes apparel nationally through the <ORGANIZATION> Brylane </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>'s Secret catalogue divisions. During the first half, <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 333.2 million, or 59 cents per share, up from $ 244.5 million, or 43 cents a share, for the first six months of 1987. First-half sales totaled $ 9.13 billion, up from $ 6.94 billion a year earlier. Limited said its earnings fell 47 percent during the first six months to $ 54.6 million, or 30 cents a share, from $ 102.6 million, or 54 cents a share, in the first half of last year. Sales rose to $ 1.7 billion from $ 1.63 billion.

<HEAD>Judge Freezes Assets In Stock Trading Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Tuesday authorized an order to freeze the assets of six men charged with racketeering in an alleged phony stock trading scheme. In rejecting the defendants' request for a stay, Judge <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON> of the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> left intact a federal district judge's freeze order. Winter set an Aug. 17 date for a three-judge panel in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to hear an appeal. The 2nd Circuit, which covers the states of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and usually sits in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, is in recess. Winter agreed to hear arguments in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, where he maintains his office. Five of the defendants in the racketeering case are top officers of <LOCATION> Princeton-Newport </LOCATION>, an investment partnership based in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The sixth is a former bond trader for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the Wall Street investment firm. Last Friday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> issued a restraining order freezing some of the defendants' assets, which would be subject to forfeiture if they are convicted of racketeering. The district judge had barred the government from distributing copies of his freeze order pending a hearing on the appeal. But under Winter's ruling, the government was permitted to distribute copies to almost two dozen financial institutions, partnerships and corporations, including <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Federal prosecutors had sought a much broader release of the order `` We wanted it to be distributed to everybody,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. The assets ordered frozen include those owned by the defendants. The order prohibits Princeton-Newport, which was not named as a defendant, from diluting any of its assets but does not bar any transactions that are considered part of the normal course of business. More than $ 200 million is invested with the partnership and its subsidiaries by limited partners not named in the case. Lawyers for those entities not named as defendants argued the freeze order was too broad and that the district court went beyond its authority in freezing the assets of entities not named as defendants. The six were named last Thursday in a 35-count indictment on charges of racketeering and conspiracy, the first time a racketeering charge has been leveled against securities traders. The defendants from Princeton-Newport are <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarzecki </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smotrich </PERSON>. Also named was <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON>, a former securities trader at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. The indictment accuses the six of a multimillion-dollar mail and wire fraud conspiracy to make false stock trades in order to create phony long-term capital gains and short-term capital losses for Princeton-Newport. The indictment charged there was a scheme involving the bogus sale of securities between Princeton-Newport and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to create more than $ 13 million in phony tax losses and avoid regulatory disclosure requirements.

<TEXT>
 A baldness remedy developed by the <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is one step closer to final federal approval, company officials said Tuesday. The Kalamazoo-based pharmaceutical company said it received an `` approvable letter'' from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for its topical minoxidil preparation for the treatment of male pattern baldness, developed under the trade name Rogaine. An approvable letter is `` historically the last step before final approval'' for marketing, said company spokesman R.D. LaRue. <PERSON> LaRue </PERSON> said the letter means the scientific data submitted by the company have been approved, leaving only label language to be worked out. <PERSON> LaRue </PERSON> would not speculate when final approval may be granted. After a brief halt in dealing on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> was up about 75 cents at $ 32.25 a share in active afternoon trading.

The <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index fell 13.4 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,862.6. Sharply declining prices on Wall Street pulled <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> equities lower, dealers said. The Dow Jones industrial average was off 31.12 points at 2,076.12 as the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> session drew to a close. `` We're entirely geared to Wall Street at this point,'' one equity analyst said. Volume was a moderate 424.9 million shares, compared with Monday's 369.2 million shares. Dealers said <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stock prices were still reeling from Monday's unexpected half-point rise in the British commercial banks' base lending rate to 11 percent. Some dealers said the increase in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> discount rate, on the heels of Monday's British rate rise, sparked fears of another round of global interest rate hikes. The move by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> central bank `` has reinforced the message that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is more concerned about the pace of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic expansion than they had given voice to previously,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Larkum </PERSON>, a British equity market analyst at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index fell 13.6 points to 1,501.1. But the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index rose 7.79 points to close at 1,062.61.

 The stock market sunk deeper into negative territory today after holding at sharply lower levels in reaction to news that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> boosted its key bank lending rate. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 32.90 at 2,074.50 an hour before the closing bell. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 14 to 3 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 268 issues up, 1,253 down and 408 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume, augmented by dividend-related moves and computer-triggered sell programs, came to 179.99 million shares as of 3 p.m. on Wall Street. The market fell sharply shortly after the opening when the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> announced it was hiking the discount rate to 6.5 percent from 6 percent. The increase marks the first change in the rate since Sept. 7 and puts the rate at its highest level in more than two years. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said its decision, which could be mimicked by other interest rates like those on credit cards and mortgages, `` reflects the intent ... to reduce inflationary pressure.'' Analysts expected an initial selloff following the news but were cautiously optimistic that the market could digest the increase in a matter of days. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON>, a technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said that there was n't any panic selling going on, although portfolios were being realigned and consolidated. A few investors took the opportunity to hunt for bargains and even looked on the news as positive. `` The feeling is that the sooner the medicine is administered, the quicker the patient will recover,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, vice president and technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. With the dollar was up sharply on the announcement, analysts predicted more foreign funds will shift into dollar-denominated instruments like stocks and bonds While analysts had expected the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to tighten its reins on the money supply this week, few expected the change would come in the discount rate, which is the most dramatic move the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can take. Most thought the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would push up the federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans. <PERSON> Metz </PERSON> said, however, that the action enhances the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s credibility among those who thought the central bank would refrain from making any decisive moves before November's presidential election Traders were keeping a sharp eye on the credit markets, where the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year bond plummeted about $ 10 per $ 1,000 in face value. Among actively traded <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> issues, <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> fell -LCB- to 31 -LCB- with more than 51 million shares changing hands as traders moved to capture the company's dividend. <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> was up -RCB- at 32 \ The company said it received an `` approvable'' letter from the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for its Rogaine baldness treatment.

 Wheat, corn and soybean futures closed modestly higher Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> with prospects for rain offsetting a private report indicating severe drought damage to corn and soybean crops. Oat futures closed lower. The widely-followed crop analyst <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> estimated 1988 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean production at 1.48 billion bushels, down 23 percent from last year's actual production of 1.91 billion bushels. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> estimated corn production at 4.28 billion bushels, a 39 percent drop from the 7.06 billion bushels harvested last year. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>'s numbers fell near the low end of other private estimates issued in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s official report on Thursday In its July crop report, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> pegged 1988 soybean production at 1.65 billion bushels and corn production at 5.2 billion bushels. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly crop update, showing a decline in crop conditions last week, provided further support to the grain futures, said <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Balletto </PERSON>, soybean analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Kuwait Pledges to Limit Stake in BP to 21.68 Percent</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: rewrites throughout with trade office refusing documents.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investment arm of the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> government, said Tuesday it signed legal documents pledging to limit its stake in <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC to its current 21.68-percent level However, Trade Secretary Lord <PERSON> Young </PERSON> refused to accept the documents, and returned them on grounds they would be prejudicial in a review of the stake by the <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said. The commission, which currently is reviewing the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> holding in <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION>, is expected to decide by Sept. 2 whether the stake is anti-competitive or against the national interest. Young is to decide what action to take in light of the commission's findings. The London-based Kuwaiti office said it also pledged not to exercise voting rights representing more than 14.9 percent of the oil giant's shares. The office also promised not to use its stake `` to further any other commercial or political interest of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>.'' In addition, the office agreed not to seek representation on <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors, and not to oppose the election of any <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> board members proposed by the board. The Kuwaiti office's law firm, <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON>, said the pledges were designed to make legally binding the assurances which the office already has given to the British government about its BP stake. `` In order to put beyond doubt that it regards itself as bound by the assurances already given, the state of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has entered into binding covenants, intended to be enforceable by the British government in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> courts, which confirm that its interest in BP is that of an investor only,'' <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON> said. The Kuwaiti office stressed the legal documents were signed `` entirely on its own initiative'' and not under pressure from the British government or commission. The office began aquiring the stake in British Petroleum piecemeal after the government sold off its remaining 31.5 percent stake in the oil company last fall. The 7.5 billion-pound, or $ 13 billion, share sale coincided with the stock market crash, which depressed the market price of the oil company's stock.

 Investors dumped stocks and bonds Tuesday but the dollar rallied smartly against major foreign currencies after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> boosted its key bank lending rate a half percentage point for the first time since Black Monday. The increase in the discount rate, to 6.5 percent from 6 percent, was made `` to reduce inflationary pressures -LRB- and -RRB- ... in light of the growing spread of market interest rates over the discount rate,'' according to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>. Many economists predicted other interest rates, including those on mortgages or home-equity loans, would rise as a result of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s credit tightening. And a few market watchers worried about the near-term effects on the already skittish stock market. The increase in the discount-rate _ the fee the central bank charges member banks for loans _ was the second since <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s helm a year ago. On Sept. 4, the central bank raised the rate for the first time in three years, to 6 percent from 5.5 percent. While last September's increase in the rate also was taken in response to inflationary fears, analysts later cited it as a contributing factor to the Oct. 19 stock market crash. `` I just hope history does n't repeat itself,'' said <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I do n't look for a market collapse but the cross-currents of the stock market are n't very favorable. It certainly is dangerous.'' On Wall Street, stock prices fell sharply in response to the announcement, with the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials losing slightly more than 28 points to 2,079.13. It had been down nearly 40 points late in the day. Bond prices tumbled while interest rates rose. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year issue was off about $ 10 per $ 1,000 face amount, while its yield jumped to 9.19 percent from 9.10 percent late Monday In foreign exchange, the dollar advanced strongly against major currencies. Higher interest rates make the dollar more valuable. The biggest increases came against the Japanese yen and West German marks. By late afternoon Tuesday, the dollar had broken through the psychologically important 135-yen level from Monday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> close of 133.97, and to 1.92 marks from 1.90 Analysts had expected the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to tighten its reins on the money supply this week, but few were expecting an increase in the discount rate, which is the most dramatic move the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can take. Tuesday's increase brings the discount rate to its steepest level since April 1986, when it fell to 6.5 percent from 7 percent. `` The -LRB- credit -RRB- markets have been screaming for a discount rate increase for quite some time; the surprise was in the timing of it,'' said <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>. `` Not only is the Republican convention coming up, but we're in the middle of a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> refunding,'' in which the government is auctioning off $ 22 billion in new three - and 10-year notes this week to pay off its old debts `` I do n't think inflation is any worse today than it was last year,'' said <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, defended the discount rate hike `` The economy has been doing well but inflation has ben creeping up,'' he said. `` It's the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s job to throw cold water on the economy when it starts overheating and that's what it appears to be doing right now.'' Among the recent signs of strength in the economy was the July unemployment rate, which at 5.4 percent was near its 14-year lows. Concerns about inflation have pushed interest rates higher in recent months. The federal funds rate, which is the interest on overnight loans between banks, has been on the rise. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiners </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the yield spread between the fed funds rate and discount rate had been at its highest level in about a year. A month ago, major banks boosted their prime lending rates, a half percentage point to 9.5 percent from 9 percent. `` I would n't be surprised if we had another prime rate hike by Friday,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Resler </PERSON>, chief economist <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> received government approval Tuesday for its $ 1.2 billion purchase of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's oldest rail lines with track stretching from <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, which has 15,000 miles of track, will retain its name and incorporate into its operations the smaller <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> once the purchase is completed, company officials said. By a 4-0 vote, the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> gave approval for the railroad's sale by its parent <ORGANIZATION> Sante </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Industries </LOCATION>, a subsidiary of the Denver-based <ORGANIZATION> Anschutz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Anschutz </PERSON>, owner of the privately held company, told reporters he intends to concentrate on reducing <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s debts, partly through the sale of some of its real estate holdings, and modernize the railroad's equipment and `` We will be in the railroad business, first and foremost,'' said <PERSON> Anschutz </PERSON>, whose background is in energy. <PERSON> Anschutz </PERSON>, who has a reputation of being reclusive, acknowledged that he had never before held a news conference, but he said he wanted to meet with reporters to set to rest unfounded `` rumors,'' including one that sought the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> to break it up and make a quick profit. `` It's very important that this company be kept together,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Anschutz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> purchased <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Industries </LOCATION> four years ago. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtman </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, expressed confidence in <PERSON> Anschutz </PERSON>'s devotion to railroading. `` He's a long-term player,'' <PERSON> Holtman </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Anschutz </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> said the merger of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> railroads would have the best competitive benefits and be in the public interest. The merger was recommended by both the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The commission last year ordered the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to divest itself of either the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> railroads after it rejected a proposal to merge the two rail lines. The company chose to sell the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s stock has been held in a trust for nearly five years pending the outcome of the battle over who should own the railroad. `` We look forward to completing the sale, getting out of trusteeship and moving forward again with a clear idea of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s future course and direction,'' said <PERSON> Denman </PERSON> <PERSON> McNear </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anschutz </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s management team would be chosen from among the senior managers of both the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> Fe Southern reached agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> on the sale last February, but when permission for the transaction was sought from the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION>, another railroad company, <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, objected and asked that it be allowed to buy the railroad. But the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> in a series of votes Tuesday turned its back on the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> proposal. One concern of the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> was <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION>'s financial outlook in light of a $ 600 million court judgment that is under appeal. The judgment stems from antitrust and contract violations involving a coal-slurry pipeline project in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> had argued that the judgment would not affect its ability to finance the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> purchase. <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> could challenge the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> ruling in court, but the company's president and chief executive officer, <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, said no decision has been made on what the next step, if any, would be. `` We're not ruling out anything,'' <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> told reporters after the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> vote. The <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, which is rich in history, operates up and down the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and along the southern tier of the country with tracks stretching from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, through central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and across the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> as far east as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. It also operates lines from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Ogden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, where it links up with the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION>, and from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to the Gulf Coast. The Denver & amp; <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> runs along a central corridor from <LOCATION> Ogden </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. Both railroads have been closely intertwined with the history of the West, helping to bring in settlers, miners and industry. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s founders helped drive the golden spike in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> in 1869, linking the country's first transcontinental rail line. Two years later, the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION> ran its first train from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anschutz </PERSON> said the new railroad `` will operate under the banner of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>,'' although within the company the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> will continue to maintain its own identity. He said he decided to retain the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> name because it is by far the larger of the two railroads and probably better known. `` Last of all, I like the name,'' he added.

 The stock market fell deep into negative territory today in reaction to news that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> boosted its key bank lending rate, but equities managed to finish off their worst levels. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> announced shortly after the opening bell that it was hiking the discount rate a half a percentage point to 6.5 percent, its highest level in more than two years. Stock prices immediately headed south. An increase in the discount rate, which is the fee the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> charges for short-term loans to member banks, is the central bank's most direct way of pushing interest rates higher as a curb on economic growth Jumps in other interest rates, including those on mortgage rates and credit cards, are likely to follow. Analysts were cautiously optimistic that the market, which had been anticipating higher interest rates, could digest the hike in the coming days. They reasoned that with the dollar up sharply on the announcement, foreign funds will shift into dollar-denominated instruments like stocks and bonds. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON>, a technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, noted that volume, minus dividend-capturing strategies, was moderate and that there was no sign of any panic selling. A few investors took the opportunity to hunt for bargains and even considered the news somewhat positive. `` The feeling is that the sooner the medicine is administered, the quicker the patient will recover,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, vice president and technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He also said the action enhances the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s credibility among those who thought the central bank would refrain from making any decisive moves before November's presidential election.

<HEAD>Stockholder Sues Gillette Over Coniston Proxy Battle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> stockholder filed suit in federal court Tuesday claiming thousands of shareholders lost money because they sold stock after <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> used a misleading advertisement in a proxy fight against a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm. The class action suit is the latest chapter in a seven-month saga involving <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s failed efforts to gain control of the personal care giant that appeared over when the parties settled out of court last week. The suit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of former <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> shareholder <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, claims <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s slate of candidates to the <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> board was defeated in the April 21 proxy vote because of a <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> advertisement questioning the investment firm's makeup. `` The defendants intended to and did create a false and misleading impression that <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s slate of candidates should not be elected ... and would not be able to sell <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> at a premium over market prices, which misstatements deflated the market prices of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> common stock,'' the suit states. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>, which had acquired 5.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s 112 million outstanding shares, had sought to gain a third of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s 12-member board and then sell the razor blade maker to the highest bidder. The suit claims `` at least several thousand persons'' took a loss when they dumped <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> shares after the company won the proxy battle. It seeks unspecified compensation for the losses. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> stock, which had been trading around $ 40 a share before the vote, dipped to a low of about $ 36 in the days after <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> announced a narrow victory on May 3, analysts said. But the stock climbed back to over $ 40 after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> ruled July 7 that the ad was misleading and later said he was inclined to order a new election. The stock nosedived again immediately after the two sides on Aug. 1 announced a settlement in which <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy back an estimated 16 million shares from <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> at $ 45 each, or about $ 720 million. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> stock fell 37 -LCB- cents a share to $ 35 in composite trading Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The lawsuit claims that in the three days after the ad was published, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> received 642,000 proxies revoking prior ballots submitted for <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>. The difference would have closed a 52 percent to 48 percent gap but not reversed the outcome. The suit represents people who lost money selling <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> stock between April 19, the date of the advertisements, and July 6, when <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> ruled that the ads contained `` false and misleading'' information about <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>. The ads, which appeared in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and The Wall Street Journal, said <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> was controlled by a `` complicated web'' of foreign and domestic firms involved in its effort to control <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>. `` As a result of that, the proposal was defeated and the stock dropped,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, a prominent <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> securities lawyer who is representing <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, an attorney with an office in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` In order to minimize the damage, my client sold out. `` -LRB- Stockholders' -RRB- expectations were <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal would be have been approved by the shareholders and the stock would have gone up.'' <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> sold all of his more than 20,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> stock after the company withstood the <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> bid. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fausch </PERSON> said about the suit: `` We're not surprised. This is a litigious world.'' Analysts said they did not expect the latest legal challenge to <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> to affect the company. `` I think it's without merit,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkness </PERSON>. `` Stocks move around and elections are won and lost. If you're going to play the game you've got to be a big boy.'' <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> filed suit on April 14 claiming <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> falsified <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filings and failed to fully disclose its investors. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s countersuit, filed five days later, charged <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> with misrepresentation in the advertisements <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s suit was heard first in a non-jury trial. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s case against <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> was in pre-trial stages when the sides settled

 <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahs </PERSON> see the future of the American fishing industry in farmers' barns and abandoned inner-city buildings. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fahs </PERSON>, co-founders of <ORGANIZATION> Fresh-Culture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, say they've developed a way to raise 40,000 pounds of fish a year in tanks fitting in 5,000 square feet of space. `` I think people will pay more for a top-quality product they feel safe with,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorder </PERSON> said. Reports of medical waste and other pollution in the nation's waters has spurred increasing worries among consumer about the fish they buy, he added. The Fresh-Culture system, which sells for about $ 125,000, is the first to reduce energy costs enough to economically raise fresh-water fish indoors in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fahs </PERSON> claim. Striped bass, salmon and other fish grown in the system's 15 cylindrical tanks can be sold to restaurants and fish markets to meet the growing demand for fish, they say. Increasingly health conscious Americans have been eating more fish in recent years. Consumption per capita has grown from 12.3 pounds in 1982 to 15.4 pounds last year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Herr </PERSON>, a program administrator with the state <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, said the technology used in the Fresh-Culture system is new. `` We definitely see that it will be able to be used by our <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> farmers that want to diversify,'' <PERSON> Herr </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fahs </PERSON>, a 35-year-old former plant manager with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said fish farming also could bring industry back to inner cities. `` You can put this in a burned out building they're selling for a dollar,'' he said. Fish farming itself is not new. Catfish have been raised in outdoor ponds for about 20 years. Trout also is `` farmed'' outdoors in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and elsewhere; and striped bass is raised in tanks in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and elsewhere. Unlike these systems, Fresh-Culture recirculates almost all the water in the tanks, said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorder </PERSON>, 36, who has been researching aquaculture for 10 years. It also costs little to heat, one of the main stumbling blocks of previous systems with recirculating water, he said. In a small building in <LOCATION> Kutztown </LOCATION>, a rural eastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> town, <PERSON> Fahs </PERSON> and <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorder </PERSON> are raising striped bass, trout and tilapia in one of their systems. They say they hope to begin selling their fish to restaurants in January. A 2 -LCB- horsepower motor pumps air to the 2,000-gallon tanks and pushes the water filters for them, while a computer monitors water temperature and heats the tanks overnight, when energy costs are lower, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorder </PERSON> said. During a power outage, a backup gas-powered air pump is activated, he added. Trout and salmon require temperatures from 60 to 70 degrees, while striped bass and tilapia need 80-degree water, according to <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorder </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fahs </PERSON> said fish can be produced in six months for about $ 2.50 a pound after start-up costs, with proper management, and sold for $ 5 or more to restaurants in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the Northeast. <ORGANIZATION> Aquatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego-based </LOCATION> company, expects to harvest 650,000 pounds of striped bass this year from a fish farm in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovanec </PERSON>, an assistant production manager. Unlike Fresh-Culture's system, Aquatic Systems has geothermally heated tanks and only recirculates some of the water, <PERSON> Hovanec </PERSON> said. `` I may be unnecessarily skeptical, but there are at least 20 or 30 people trying to get into striped bass,'' he said. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fahs </PERSON> say they expect the skepticism. `` There are a lot of systems on paper,'' <PERSON> Fahs </PERSON> acknowledges. But they say they are confident their approach will attract customers. `` It's the freshest, non-polluted source of fish you can get,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorder </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Chevron Corp. To Expand Capacity For Polymer Grade Propylene
Manufacture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading marketer of polymer grade propylene, announced plans Tuesday to expand capacity for the manufacture of the chemical at two <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> facilities. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> plans to expand capacity for the manufacture of polymer grade propylene at its Port Arthur refinery and <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bayou </LOCATION> olefins plant in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the company said in a statement. Polymer grade propylene is a high purity building block chemical used to make other materials such as polypropylene, which is extensively used in plastic automobile parts, toys, medical products and appliances. `` Chevron remains strongly committed to the polymer grade propylene business,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Olefins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Derivatives Division. `` The domestic and international propylene consuming businesses have been expanding rapidly in the past two years, especially polypropylene. This expansion assures that we will be able to keep pace with that growth,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. The expansions, to be constructed in two stages, will add about 350 million pounds to the company's annual capacity to produce polymer grade propylene. The total capacity will be 1.3 billion pounds per year. The first stage is scheduled to begin in October and will boost capacity at subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Olefins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Derivatives Division plant at <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bayou </LOCATION> by about 20 percent to 800 million pounds by adding propylene splitting towers to its ethylene unit. The second stage, anticipated to begin during the fourth quarter of 1989, will boost capacity at subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION> refinery by more than 180 million pounds per year by adding a new propylene upgrading unit. The company said expansion at the two facilities will be complemented by installation of a new olefin splitter and export facility at <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Pascagoula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, refinery, designed to separate and transport dilute propylene to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for further upgrading. In addition, the <LOCATION> Galena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> terminal of <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, situated on the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Ship Channel, will be modified to receive and transport this material to <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bayou </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> finding that industry rules for containerized ships unfairly discriminate against small cargo shippers was upheld Tuesday by a federal appeals court. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here said the maritime commission correctly ignored the rules' effect on labor-management relations when it found they improperly forced small shippers to employ unionized dock workers to handle their cargo. `` It is not the national labor policy to allow otherwise unlawful activity merely because an employer and a union have agreed to it in mandatory collective bargaining,'' a three-judge panel of the court said in a unanimous ruling. At issue are rules first negotiated in 1968 by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Longshoremen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the shipping industry that require unionized dockhands to load or unload cargo containers that pass through East Coast ports. The rules exempt manufacturers and large shippers that load cargo into containers at their own warehouses. But small shippers, whose cargo would not fill a single container, are forced to lease containers from the shipping companies and deliver their goods for loading at a unionized pier. The regulations were negotiated as part of the industry's efforts to introduce cargo containers, which can be unloaded from a ship into a railroad car or a flat-bed truck without being opened by dock hands The widespread use of containers has greatly reduced the number of longshoremen needed to unload ships and the rules were implemented to help the <ORGANIZATION> ILA </ORGANIZATION> cut the losses to its workforce. Last year, the maritime commission unanimously struck down the regulations, which were challenged by freight forwarders, trucking companies and handlers of small amounts of cargo. The commission's finding, however, was stayed while the ILA and the shipping industry appealed the decision. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammon </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brokers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forwarders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, hailed the court's decision, saying the rules amount to `` flagrant featherbeading ... that was just very damaging to import-export commerce.'' There was on immediate comment from the <ORGANIZATION> ILA </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to appeal the decision to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The ruling could also become a bargaining chip in contract negotiations between the ILA and the shipping industry. The regulations require that merchandise placed on containers within 50 miles of a port by non-ILA workers had to be unloaded on the dock and placed into different containers before it was loaded on ships. The rules mean `` extra costs in delays and exposure to pilferage,'' <PERSON> Hammon </PERSON> said. Small cargo shippers have begun using Canadian ports to avoid the restrictions, resulting in less business for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> ports, he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Surges On U.S. Discount Rate Rise; Gold Slides</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar advanced strongly on domestic and foreign markets Tuesday after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> surprised traders by increasing its discount rate. Gold prices fell. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 426.90 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 430.20 late Monday. `` Raising rates in the face of a strong dollar probably was not expected,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Traders had not expected the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to increase the discount rate, the fee the central bank charges for short-term loans to member banks, because the dollar has been strong, <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON> said Investors bought the dollar because higher interest rates make it more valuable. <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON> said it was possible the major industrial countries known as the Group of Seven _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is one _ were putting their monetary policies ahead of their currencies. <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON> said there were rumors in the market that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other G-7 countries might follow the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s lead and increase their own interest rates. But <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said foreign interest rate hikes would not stop the dollar's upswing. `` The only thing to put a cap on the dollar would be central bank selling,'' he said. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> move confirmation of the economy's strength The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s board voted unanimously to increase the disount rate to 6.5 percent from 6 percent. The increase, which took effect immediately, was the first change in the rate since Sept. 4 and put the rate at its highest in more than two years. An increase in the discount rate is the central bank's most direct way of pushing interest rates higher as a curb on economic growth. Economists have been concerned in recent months that continuing economic growth could spark a new round of inflation, partly because of the country's low unemployment, high production levels and the Midwestern drought. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, before the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> announcement, the dollar fell 0.39 Japanese yen to a closing 133.58 yen. In late <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading, after news of the discount rate hike, the dollar rose to 134.25 yen and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it climbed to 135.15 yen from 133.725 yen late Monday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell sharply against the dollar. It cost $ 1.6830 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.7022 late Monday. Sterling also dropped against the dollar in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, closing at $ 1.6840, compared with late Monday's $ 1.7005. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.9204 West German marks, up from 1.90005; 1.6065 Swiss francs, up from 1.5883; 6.4710 French francs, up from 6.4115; 1,413.475 Italian lire, up from 1,402.00; and 1.2160 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2110 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.5960 Swiss francs, up from 1.5857; 6.4325 French francs, up from 6.3950; 2.1570 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1435; 1,403.50 Italian lire, up from 1,399.50; and 1.2137 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2097 Gold prices fell under increased selling pressure after the discount rate rise attracted investors away from bullion. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, gold dropped to a late bid of $ 426 a troy ounce, compared with $ 432.25 bid late Monday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid $ 426 an ounce compared with $ 432 bid late Monday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 3.39 to close at a bid $ 430.61 an ounce. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to $ 427.40 a troy ounce, down from $ 430.40 late Monday. Silver slipped in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid of $ 6.60 a troy ounce, down from $ 6.78 late Monday. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION>, silver fell to $ 6.630 a troy ounce from late Monday's $ 6.675.

 The stock market fell sharply Tuesday following the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s surprise hike in its key bank lending rate, which sparked fears that interest rates may be headed even higher. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had been off nearly 40 points, closed down 28.27 at 2,079.13, its fourth consecutive losing session. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 348 issues up, 1,206 down and 418 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> came to 200.71 million shares, up from 148.80 million in the previous session but augmented by dividend-related trading. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 224.85 million shares. Stock prices opened slightly lower but headed further south shortly after the opening when the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> announced it was boosting the discount rate a half a percentage point to 6.5 percent, its highest level in more than two years. An increase in the discount rate, which is the fee the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> charges for short-term loans to member banks, is the central bank's most direct way of pushing interest rates higher to curb economic growth Economists said jumps in other interest rates, including those on mortgage rates and credit cards, are likely to follow. Some investors regarded the news on interest rates as positive, reasoning that with the economy growing strongly and inflation picking up, a dash of tighter credit could keep the economy from overheating. `` The feeling is that the sooner the medicine is administered, the quicker the patient will recover,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, vice president and technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. With the dollar up sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement, some analysts said stocks and bonds could to be in line for a boost as foreign funds shift into dollar-denominated insvestments But others feared that much more will be needed to keep the economy in line. Concern that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> `` is going to have to tighten the screw another notch'' gave most investors the jitters, said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` The market is still looking for direction and is locked in gridlock between higher interest rates and strong economic numbers,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, adding that what results is a trendless trading pattern. While analysts had expected the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to tighten its reins on the money supply this week, few expected the change would come in the discount rate, which is the most dramatic move the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can take. Most thought the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would push up the federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans.

 A young lawyer at the center of an insider trading ring known as the `` Yuppie Five'' was sentenced Tuesday to four months in prison _ nearly two years after he admitted his guilt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> pleaded guilty in November 1986 to four criminal counts for his part in an insider trading scheme with three other Wall Street professionals and an investor. The five, who have all pleaded guilty to various charges, were all in their 20s at the time of the indictment and were dubbed the `` Yuppie Five.'' The case had nothing to do with insider trading cases involving <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, said officials. <PERSON> David </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, the last to plead guilty after his pre-trial motions were denied by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> in late 1986, pleaded guilty to conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud and obstruction of a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> investigation. `` You completely disrupt the forces of the free market and help to create incredible cynicism among the general populace,'' <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> lectured <PERSON> David </PERSON>, adding: `` People think that no one is straight.'' Defense lawyer <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Fennell </PERSON>, in asking for leniency, noted that <PERSON> David </PERSON>, once an associate at the the prominent <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rifkind </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wharton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>, faces disbarment and has been driving a cab to support himself. Visibly irritated, <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> countered: `` I do n't think anyone should confuse the practice of law with a right _ it's a privilege!'' `` I regret my conduct,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON>, dressed in a dark gray suit, told <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> before sentence was imposed and asked the judge for an opportunity `` to help rebuild my life as I have tried to do.'' `` If I just say ` Go and sin no more,''' said <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, slapping his own wrist, `` I'm making a mockery of the process.'' <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> added: `` You did betray a trust.'' He sentenced <PERSON> David </PERSON> to four months in prison and four years probation. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> did not impose a fine but <PERSON> David </PERSON> faces civil penalties of between $ 50,000 and $ 150,000 under an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> consent agreement. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowenson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, noted that <PERSON> David </PERSON> had cooperated extensively for almost two years with federal investigators and if there were any future trials arrising from the probe `` Mr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> would be an important government witness.'' <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> said he would have sentenced <PERSON> David </PERSON> to more jail time if not for his cooperation. <PERSON> David </PERSON> received the longest jail term of the `` Yuppie Five.'' Former stock broker <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> was sentenced to two months in prison but the other three did not receive jail terms.

 Prospects of a second night of rain in the central Corn Belt limited rallies in corn and soybean futures prices Tuesday, despite an influential private report indicating severe drought damage to the crops. Wheat futures also gained slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> while oat futures closed lower. On other markets, coffee futures rose sharply, precious metals declined; livestock and meat were mixed; energy futures were lower; and stock-index futures retreated. A report from the respected Chicago-based crop analyst <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> generated buying interest in crop futures. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> estimated 1988 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean production at 1.48 billion bushels, down 23 percent from last year's actual production of 1.91 billion bushels, and corn production at 4.28 billion bushels, a 39 percent drop from the 7.06 billion bushels harvested last year. `` This means the worst drought of the century is producing the smallest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn crop since 1970,'' <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> said in his report. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> also reported signs of spider mite damage to soybean plants in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Even if such plants received rain, he said, `` they may only stabili the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.79 \ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 4 \ cents higher with September at $ 2.99 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 5 -LCB- cents lower with September at $ 2.68 a bushel; and soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents to 20 cents higher with August at $ 8.55 -RCB- a Coffee futures prices surged in light trading on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> but analysts said the rally was technical in nature and not related to any new developments within the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> Light buying by coffee roasters nudged prices past a key technical point, which triggered a broader rally, said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaul </PERSON>, coffee analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Coffee for September delivery settled 3.81 cents higher at $ 1.1834 a pound Gold and silver futures retreated on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> announced it was boosting the discount rate from 6 percent to 6.5 percent. But <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, vice president of the precious metals and foreign exchange group at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the sell-off was precipitated by weak technical factors, not by prospects of lower inflation. `` Short-term technicals were bearish before the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had anything to say,'' he said. Gold settled $ 2.80 to $ 3 lower with August at $ 427.40 a troy ounce; silver was 8.5 cents to 8.8 cents lower with September at $ 6.63 a troy ounce. Cattle futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid conflicting views about future beef demand and cash prices, analysts said. Pork futures retreated on weakening cash prices. Live cattle settled .28 cent lower to .38 cent higher with August at 68.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .53 cent higher with August at 79.90 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to 1.30 cents lower with August at 45.45 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .15 cent to .45 cent lower with August at 32.80 cents a pound. Oil prices weakened in quiet trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said the slump was a reaction to Monday's sharp runup. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents to 30 cents lower with September at $ 15.68 a barrel; heating oil was .43 cent to .53 cent lower with September at 44.07 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .35 cent to .61 cent lower with September at 46.15 cents a pound.

<HEAD>House Approves Tariff-Free Trade Pact With Canada</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Subs 7th graf, ``Counterpart legislation xxx to CORRECT that
Canadian bill not yet in Senate</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to sweep away most tariffs and a wide array of other barriers to the annual $ 166 billion trade in goods and services between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` We have a bill here, in short, in which everyone gains and no one loses,'' Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., said as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved 366-40 and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> the free-trade agreement signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> last January The measure would authorize the president to phase out most tariffs between the two countries over the next 10 years, and approves elimination of a wide range of other trade barriers under the pact. Many lawmakers said such a free-trade zone is needed as a counterbalance to European Common Market protectionism. `` Many of the Europeans are talking about free trade as being something for Europeans within that bloc _ I hope they do n't go that way,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, his party's vice presidential candidate, as his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved the measure earlier Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to act soon, possibly later this week, on the measure. Counterpart legislation is stalled in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, where it is encountering <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> opposition. The agreement does not set up a common market between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. That would mean adopting common tariffs on imports from third countries. The free-trade zone would merely eliminate tariffs and some other barriers between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The two countries would still have differing tariffs on imports from third countries. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> already have established a free-trade zone. Advocates of the agreement claim it will spur <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports and create jobs while lowering consumer prices. Critics say agriculture and assorted other industries could be hurt by lowering tariffs. Tariffs currently apply to about 25 percent of trade between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and the rest already is duty-free. Ten percent of existing tariffs, applying to goods ranging from telecommunications equipment to whiskey and rum, would be eliminated immediately under the agreement and the rest over the next decade. The agreement would ease the way for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens and Canadians to invest in each others' countries. It would clear away barriers to exports of many services but would exempt transportation and cultural services. It would eliminate barriers to import and export of crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, coal, electricity, uranium and other nuclear fuels. The measure has dismayed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> uranium industry, which stalled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approval of the bill while it pressed for a substantial subsidy to offset Canadian imports. The agreement would eliminate tariffs on autos and auto parts, accounting for one-third of all trade between the countries, over the next decade. As things stand, 95 percent of auto trade between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> already moves duty-free. To get duty-free treatment, autos and auto parts would have to be 50 percent manufactured in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pease </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said he would support the measure even though he was upset over the auto provisions. `` They improve the status quo -LRB- but -RRB- I strongly believe they fall far short of the advantages that benefit the Canadian auto industry,'' he said. <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> said the agreement should contain provisions that would bar duty-free imports of autos and automotive products assembled in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> from parts manufactured in third countries. Among the bill's opponents, Rep. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, said the agreement would `` leave us with Canadian agricultural markets that are largely closed to American agricultural producers and American markets that are largely open to Canadian agricultural producers, and I'm concerned about that.'' He singled out <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> rail subsidies for grain shipped through the huge lake port at <LOCATION> Thunder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>., under the century-old Crow's Nest Act American producers receive nothing similar and thus would be treated unfairly, <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> said. Under the pact, the Canadians did agree to end rail subsidies for grain shipped through their western port of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>. Another farm lawmaker, Rep. <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Daub </PERSON>, R-Neb., said he was confident the measure would protect not only wheat but corn, sugar and dry edible beans from a wave of Canadian imports He said the agreement would improve the chances of success in the current <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of negotiations to modernize the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and thus `` end the subsidy shootout in which the only winners are the giddy, greedy buyers, happily snatching up agricultural commodities at prices below the cost of production.''

 A law firm has agreed to a record $ 50 million settlement of a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit over the firm's management of a thrift that closed two years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday. Proceeds of the settlement with the Philadelphia-based firm of <ORGANIZATION> Blank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Comisky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> McCauley </PERSON> will be shared by the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> with former stockholders of <ORGANIZATION> Sunrise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boynton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The settlement, which the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> said was the largest ever paid to it by a law firm to settle a claim, included establishment of a $ 10 million indemnity fund to cover any claims by outside parties against the firm, which represented Sunrise. The federal suit filed in 1986 charged the law firm acted negligently in advising Sunrise, improperly closed loans, aided former Sunrise officials in violating several statutes and banking regulations and represented parties with conflicts of interest. `` This settlement demonstrates that where violations contributing to insolvency are caused by the negligence or malpractice of professionals, including law firms, the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will hold them, as well as thrift management, fully responsible and accountable,'' said <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, chairman of the bank board. The <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> sued the thrift's former officers, directors and lawyers, including 87 partners and former partners at Blank <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Under the agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> will receive 72 percent of the first $ 40 million and 95 percent of the remaining $ 10 million. Unused funds will revert to the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> and shareholders by August 1992.

Ironically, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest in <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> was at the heart of the decision to sell. The number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shareholders exceeded the Canadian government's guidelines on foreign ownership of cable operators. In a series of stock buybacks designed to reduce that foreign ownership, <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> spent roughly $ 350 million, incurring a lot of debt in the process. <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, a utility holding company serving about 1.3 million customers in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> area, has a 50 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Paragon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, which operates <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cable systems with more than 670,000 subscribers in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and several other states. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> has 1.5 million cable subscribers in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, owns <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> television station <ORGANIZATION> CFMT-TV </ORGANIZATION> and is the dominant shareholder in the Canadian Home Shopping Network.

 The partial merger of two <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> newspapers may not have an immediate impact across the industry, analysts say, but it could set the tone for the future with the market becoming more concentrated and the wealthiest media companies growing more powerful. The deal approved this week by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> brings together <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, in a deal four times larger than any joint operating agreement approved under the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970 While the move is designed to preserve two independent editorial voices in a big metropolitan market, some analysts and scholars still raise questions about the move's competitive impact. Critics charge the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> combination is a step toward further concentration of the industry where the trend is toward chain ownership and media conglomerates and where the number of independently owned papers is fading. `` This means that eventually there will be no city in the country left with competing papers and then pressure will be more immediate to wipe out the little competition that's left in the form of alternative papers, community papers and suburban papers,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brugmann </PERSON>, publisher of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guardian </LOCATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> that will oversee the merger, believes joint operating arrangements make good economic sense in an industry where second place often leads to financial failure. In the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> case, the advertising market share _ where a newspaper gets the bulk of its revenue _ had become so heavily weighted in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that the Free Press could n't survive, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said He said joint operating arrangements will continue to benefit the industry by saving newspapers too weak to survive on their own. `` Some newspapers will be saved by reason of a -LRB- joint operating agreement -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>. The danger in concentration, however, is that it could dilute competition by shifting power from the readers to media owners, who are in the position to charge higher prices for circulation and advertising. `` All we really know is that prices are going to go up,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON>, professor at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who has studied joint newspaper agreements and approves of the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> arrangement. `` They'll be cutting their costs and increasing their revenues. It's the same thing that happens in any monopoly situation,'' <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> predicted that <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> newsstand prices, now among the lowest in the nation at between 15 cents and 20 cents per copy, could be raised to the industry average of 35 cents within the next few years. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenhoff </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, indicated Tuesday that prices will go up, but would not say when or by how much. `` What you have in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> are among the lowest newspaper circulation prices and advertising rates in the country,'' <PERSON> Lenhoff </PERSON> said. `` Both have been losing approximately $ 30 million a year. Logic would tell you that some changes are coming but it has not been announced to what extent.'' <PERSON> Lenhoff </PERSON> said an announcement may be forthcoming before the merger takes effect on Aug. 19. In 1920, 700 cities had competing dailies. Today, there are 22. Eighty percent of daily circulation is controlled by chains, and chains have begun to merge with each other. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>, who has absorbed other chains in recent years, is not a newcomer to joint newspaper agreements. The company is now an owner in eight of the 20 joint contracts and <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> is an owner in three. Under the partial merger approved Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION>, among the 10 largest in the country, will merge production, advertising and circulation departments for 100 years, while maintaining separate editorial and news departments. Although such a merger is illegal for other businesses under antitrust law, the 1970 Newspaper Preservation Act granted newspapers selective exemption from the law if one of the newspapers is failing financially. The legislative intent was to preserve an editorial voice where one otherwise might be lost. Some analysts say the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> case could set a precedent for other large metropolitan newspapers. But others say there are few cities with competing papers ripe for such a merger. Of the 22 cities with separately owned, competing dailies, only a handful are potential candidates for joint agreements, including <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` There are so few markets where people would even want to get together and talk about it,'' <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Batus Sweetens Offer For Farmers Group To $72 A Share From $63</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, struggling to win regulatory approval for a hostile takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, sweetened its buyout offer Tuesday to more than $ 4.9 billion from $ 4.5 billion in an apparent attempt to win a friendly agreement. Farmers, a major insurance holding company, stated late Tuesday that its board would give `` careful consideration'' to the latest offer. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> raised its offer to $ 72 cash a share for Farmers' 68.4 million common shares outstanding from the previous $ 63 a share bid, and conditioned the sweetened offer on the negotiation of a definitive merger agreement by Aug. 19. Farmers stock rose 12 -LCB- cents to $ 57.75 a share Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The sweetened offer was disclosed hours after the market closed. Farmers has resisted the overtures by <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arm of British conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, since its initial $ 60 a share, or $ 4.2 billion, buyout offer in January. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> also has been attempting to win approval of the hostile takeover by the insurance commissioners of the nine states in which Farmers does business, with mixed success. Farmers noted three of the states _ <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ have rejected the takeover due to issues unrelated to the price offered by <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> also has rejected the proposal, but that decision recently was overturned by a state court. Farmers is appealing the reversal. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, owns operations that include <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Williamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and several retailers, led by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> Fifth Avenue.
