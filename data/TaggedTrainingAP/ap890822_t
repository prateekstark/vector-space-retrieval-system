<HEAD>Israeli Minister Meets Cardinal On Convent Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s religious affairs minister, <PERSON> Zevulun </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, met with Cardinal <PERSON> Franciszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON> on Tuesday in an effort to resolve the dispute over a Roman Catholic convent at the former death camp at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>. Hammer was the first high-ranking <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official to visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since diplomatic relations were severed more than 20 years ago. Any conclusions reached by Hammer and the <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> cardinal during their 1 -LCB- - hour meeting of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> were not released. Members of Hammer's family died at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> and he visited the site before meeting the cardinal, said a spokesman for the Israeli interest section in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON> announced this month that the convent would not be moved from the camp's perimeter as promised in an international accord signed by <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leaders initially agreed to transfer the Carmelite nuns by Feb. 22 to an interfaith prayer center to be built farther from the camp. But <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON> said the agreement would not be honored in an `` atmosphere of aggressive demands.'' Protests by Jewish groups increased after the deadline passed. In one highly publicized incident on July 14, an American rabbi and six students demonstrating at the convent were roughly evicted by workmen at the site. Jewish groups and others have viewed the convent as an offensive intrusion of Christian symbols at the camp, where an estimated 2.5 million Jews died. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, with the rest of the Soviet bloc except <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, cut diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1967 after the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> war. But contact has been steadily increasing. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> now has an independent interest section in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. Hammer will also meet Polish political leaders during his five-day visit that began Sunday.

 The <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Candy </PERSON> vehicle `` Uncle Buck'' took first place in the weekend box office revue, beating the highly touted `` Parenthood,'' `` The Abyss'' and `` Casualties of War.'' Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' comedy grossed $ 8.8 million, according to figures released Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Exhibitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The movie stars Candy as a peculiar relative struggling to babysit his nephew and two nieces.

Directed by <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, `` Casualties of War'' tells the story of the rape and murder of a Vietnamese girl by a group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers. `` When <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Met </PERSON> <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> ...,'' the romantic comedy pitting <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meg </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> as best friends who become lovers, finished in fifth by collecting $ 4.9 million. It was followed in sixth by `` Lethal Weapon 2,'' the action-adventure sequel with <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON>, which grossed $ 4.5 million. In seventh was the police comedy `` Turner and <PERSON> Hooch </PERSON>,'' featuring <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON>, on receipts of $ 4.3 million. In eighth was `` A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child.'' The film's take, $ 8.1 million in its opening week, fell to $ 4.1 million.

<TEXT>
 A quarter-century ago, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedan </PERSON> called the oppression of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women `` the problem that has no name.'' But <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> today has a name for <PERSON> Meiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Marimo </PERSON>'s problem: She's `` leftover Christmas cake.'' Miss <PERSON> Marimo </PERSON>, in other words, has grown a bit stale as a marriageable commodity _ at least that's what her mother complains. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where many marriages are still arranged, a woman is considered to have a shelf life of about 25 years. When <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Marimo </PERSON> was 28, she left for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ alone. <PERSON> Sumiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Morikawa </PERSON> sits next to the `` No Smoking'' sign in her <LOCATION> Waldorf-Astoria </LOCATION> office and lights a cigarette. At 39, she says she's looking for a new man She is n't particular about his background _ as long as he is n't Japanese. `` Japanese men and women, they can not understand how to love,'' says <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Morikawa </PERSON>, the owner of a translating service. Three years ago, she ended a 16-year marriage undertaken to please her tradition-minded brother in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. No passion, she says. `` Japanese businessmen are very nice, but they are so totally quality-controlled. They see themselves as company men. And their wives also, they say, ` I'm a <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> wife.' It kills the individuality of people.'' It is 11:30 a.m. <PERSON> Renko </PERSON> <PERSON> Isowa </PERSON>, 42, pauses over a dish of vanilla ice cream as she cheerily recalls the strict training of her youth in the traditional female skills. `` I learned flower arrangement, tea ceremony and cooking for two years. I was totally dead,'' says <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Isowa </PERSON>, vice president of a television production company here. `` I wanted to start working. I wanted to be a member of real society.'' Twenty-six years after `` The Feminine Mystique,'' <PERSON> Friedan </PERSON>'s manifesto of women's rights, helped kindle feminism in the West, only a trickle of women in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are able or willing to live out its creed But many of those few come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to try. The three expatriates above may seem refreshingly liberated, but in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> many would consider them wild-eyed radicals. They insist on standing out in a society where wa, or group harmony, dictates `` the nail that stands out is hammered down.'' `` Japanese women have n't been raised to have aspirations,'' says <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>, author of `` A Half-Step Behind: Japanese Women of the'80s.'' `` They're still facing boundaries we broke through 20 years ago.'' `` To be good American, you have to be an individual. To be a good Japanese, you'd better damn sight not be,'' says <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Fochios </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> psychiatrist who counsels many <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> women. `` The women who ... come to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, then get into the machinery of the country, are able to enjoy the kinds of freedoms they had never dreamed of,'' he says. `` And these women are tough. They are tough.'' Miss <PERSON> Marimo </PERSON>'s family frets, to no avail. To her friends, she is an `` incredible oyahuko,'' a bad daughter. A few years ago, she moved into her own apartment in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, watching defiantly as the social pressures that mold a Japanese woman's life _ a cycle of temporary employment, marriage and child-raising _ claimed her schoolmates one by one. Her old friends `` spoke to me as if they were accusing me, criticizing me very severely,'' recalls the lithe, long-haired Miss Marimo, a free-lance writer. `` I did n't care at all. I do n't want to be involved in housekeeping. I smiled a Japanese smile'' _ and left. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, disaffected minorities organize, as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women did in the 1970s. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, it has always been easier to jump ship than to rock the boat. Until recently. Today, the glacial rigidity of Japanese society _ `` otoko no shakai,'' the man's world _ shows signs of thawing after more than a century of uneasy integration with the West. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s giant corporations, facing chronic worker shortages as the economy surges, are beginning to open management jobs to women. Traditionally they are hired as tea-pouring `` office ladies'' while pursuing their real vocation: marriage. Japanese women are even making an impact on politics. A record 22 women won seats in the July 23 elections for Parliament's upper house. Female voters had been angered by allegations that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s just-departed prime minister, <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, kept paid mistresses The election also showed, however, that much has not changed. Many of the victorious female parliamentary candidates had portrayed themselves not as feminists but as simple housewives immune from corruption. Indeed, apart from the odd individualist who ventures abroad to live, few <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> women want change. `` If you go to a party here and introduce yourself as a housewife, people will think you're strange. But in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> it's OK. Being a housewife does n't bother <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> women, because they have a social position,'' says <PERSON> Kako </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakagawa </PERSON>, the executive editor of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper published for Japanese in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` I think in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> you have no secure place for women,'' she says. `` Here there are opportunities for women, so if you do n't try anthing hard, then you feel guilty. ... But in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> there are no opportunities so there's no such struggle. It's easy.'' `` When I go to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> women I see are very content-looking, very happy,'' says <PERSON> Naoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a researcher for <ORGANIZATION> Sunstar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese company with offices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. When I come back to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, I notice the women look very unhappy, frustrated.'' While women in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are largely blocked from positions of power, they provide a vital temporary worker base that absorbs economic downturns, allowing large Japanese companies to maintain their much-vaunted `` lifetime employment system'' for permanent workers. In addition, they are the linchpin of an economic system that allows men to spend long hours working and, as is expected, socializing afterward. With the men otherwise occupied, women often control family purse strings, and so completely control their children's destinies that surveys have shown the central relationship in a Japanese man's life is not between him and his wife but between him and his mother. So strong is such patterning of Japanese women, in fact, that leaving it behind sometimes causes deep emotional problems for expatriates, who must spurn what they have been taught since childhood and embrace alien values. `` Some of them say they feel guilty about being free as an American,'' says <PERSON> Fochios </PERSON>, the psychiatrist. `` They feel inferior to a Japanese woman because they do n't have the capacity to be a good Japanese wife.'' Some expatriate women, however, simply decide to ignore <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> values. `` Japanese women are better off. I do n't think I would like to marry an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> man,'' says <PERSON> Kiyomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Koizumi </PERSON>, a 65-year-old neurophysiologist who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1949 and married a Japanese. `` I always say my husband is like air _ you would miss it if it's not there, I ca n't live without it, but you do n't feel it An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> man might be around me too much.''

<TEXT>
 The political opposition is pursuing an unprecedented dialogue with the armed forces, seeking a formula for peaceful co-existence when <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> returns to civilian government in March. The military, which has ruled since 1973, has indicated a willingness to negotiate, but only under certain conditions. Both sides agree that the lack of communication in the past had led to a mutual animosity and distrust that both sides agree must be eliminated if the future government is to enjoy stability. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, the presidential candidate of a united center-left opposition and heavily favored to win the presidential election Dec. 14, recently remarked: `` We want an approach, an exchange of views.'' `` The isolation that has existed for years among civilians and military is not good for the country and must end,'' <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> added. `` The time has come for a dialogue.'' Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the right-wing army commander who has been president since seizing power in September, 1973, was obliged to call December's general elections after losing a referendum in October on extending his rule to 1997. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> and other opposition leaders want the dialogue to take place before the new government takes office March 11. Experts expect several highly conflictive items will be on the agenda. <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a leading adviser to <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> on military matters, said the talks would include the role of the armed forces under the civilian government, the continuation of the present commanders-in-chief in their posts, the defense budget and, probably the most sensitive problem, how the new government will deal with the human rights violations during <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s rule. After the 1973 coup, which toppled the elected government of <PERSON> Marxist </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvadoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, the military launched a campaign of political repression. Thousands of leftists were arrested, many were tortured, killed or sent into exile. Human rights groups have documented more than 700 cases of dissidents who disappeared after being arrested by seurity agents. The opposition has said that it will investigate all pending cases of rights abuse and try those responsible. Its leaders have also said they will seek to repeal an amnesty law, issued by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, that pardoned violations occurred from 1973 to 1978. That announcement by the opposition prompted a stern warning from the military ranks. Gen. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthei </PERSON>, the air force commander who is considered politically moderate and has expressed support for a dialogue, said repealing the amnesty law could unleash `` an unpredictible reaction'' by the armed forces. `` Those wanting to repeal the law do not realize how serious that could be,'' <PERSON> Matthei </PERSON> added. He noted that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> himself has warned that an attempt to try military officials could lead to an interruption of the democratic transition. Opposition leaders have insisted they seek `` truth and justice,'' not vengeance against the military. They are under heavy political pressure from human rights groups representing victims of repression or their relatives. Another highly controversial subject is the constitutional clause that allows the military chiefs, including <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, to retain their military commands under the civilian government. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has said he will remain the army's leader for as long as the constitution allows _ until 1998. Even some pro-government politicians contend the new leadership must be empowered to make changes in the military command. But the armed forces have vowed to make no concessions on the point. A statement issued by the army warned the armed forces are prepared to `` use legitimate force'' to uphold constitution, which was drafted by the military and approved in a referendum. And military commanders insist that their mission includes ensuring internal stability as well as defending the country against foreign attack. That is considered another potential area of controversy, but opposition leaders say they are prepared to talk about it, too, in spite of the risks and difficulties. `` The peaceful end of military dictatorships has never been easy, and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> can not be an exception,'' wrote <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Abeliuk </PERSON>, a Social Democratic leader, in a newspaper column. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> also has urged civilians and military to talk about their differences `` to help the transition to democracy.''

 An old guidebook says: `` One thing a foreigner in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> need never worry about is making friends.'' That was long ago, before a civil war devastated the city and nation, before the hostage-taking. Here is a report on what it was like, by an AP correspondent who lived in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in those days.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 I remember when <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> was the playground of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, a vibrant crossroad between the Orient and the West. The bright <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> sun glinted from its high-rise buildings and its vaults were full of oil money. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> was a stimulating intellectual center then, and a vital contact point for businessmen. Now, it is a shambles strewn with garbage, a city brought low by 14 years of vicious civil war. Those of us who lived there remember <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> before the war as a place where 100,000 foreigners mingled with <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> princes, high-rollers, emigres, adventurers and 17 Christian and Moslem sects. A veneer of Western culture was superimposed on the fragile sectarian structure created by the French when they granted <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> independence in 1943. A dormant volcano of hatreds seethed beneath the exuberance and sophistication. Luxury hotels, apartments and office blocks gleamed between the blue <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and pine-covered mountains. Non-Lebanese Arabs, constrained at home by puritanical Moslem rules or dictators, could kick up their heels with liquor, women or $ 300 roulette chips and voice their political opinions freely in the Arab world's only working democracy. Westerners came to tap the oil money that poured into <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, buying into several dozen <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> banks or opening their own offices. <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> decorated a full floor of its office annex at the Holiday Inn with imported carpets and furniture. A few months later, we watched from the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> office nearby as it was looted and destroyed by rival militias battling for strategic high-rise buildings along what became the line dividing Christian and Moslem sectors of the city. Westerners found <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> intriguing for its combination of modern amenities with the oriental flavor of the old gold market, its cosmopolitan society, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> food at such restaurants such as <PERSON> Ajami </PERSON>'s. I still have a dusty, English-language guidebook, the last published before the war. `` Everywhere you will feel the warm eastern hospitality,'' it says. `` One thing a foreigner in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> need never worry about is making friends.'' Fourteen years later, scores of foreigners have been kidnapped, most of them by virulently anti-Western Moslem groups. Sixteen still are held, including <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, an AP colleague. More than 150,000 Lebanese, most of them civilians, have been killed in the war and 1 million have been displaced. Burned-out hulks of the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georges </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenicia </LOCATION> and Holiday Inn hotels cluster in what once was <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s tourist center and now is a wasteland inhabited only by snipers. I recall sitting in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georges </LOCATION> restaurant in the good old days, watching water skiers skim behind needle-nosed Italian speedboats. There also was the less-costly, though fastidious, <ORGANIZATION> Myrtoum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> restaurant and pension run by <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Matschek </PERSON>, an Austrian expatriate. Regulars said it was the only place in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s sunny climate to risk eating steak tartare. An attraction at night was the great Casino <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Liban </PERSON>, north of the city in what is now <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> territory, where one could gamble or watch two imported floor shows. Those with the right connections might attend functions dominated by the doyenne of high society, <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Soursock </PERSON>. She was from an old-money Lebanese Christian family and became <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON> when she married Sir <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>. A vivid memory is of a visit to the home of <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Pharaon </PERSON>, a bachelor shipping millionaire who lived among priceless Islamic art treasures and pictures of horses he raced against those of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> princes. The racetrack on the city's dividing line is a ruin now, a nightmare scene of bullet-splintered trees and shell holes. An unusual establishment, even for <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, was the Surprise. It was the size of a packing crate and had a bartender, four stools, one hefty prostitute and a remarkable number of customers bidding for her favors. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> and large numbers of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> intellectuals who fled persecution in their own countries gave the city a more serious side. `` The Arab emigres contributed to the city more than the Lebanese socialites,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, an oil economist who spent many years in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and moved to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in 1976. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and medical school once had 5,000 students and produced a great share of the professional, academic and political leaders in the Arab world. Among the graduates was Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> carried out airline hijackings in the 1970s. A 5-month-old artillery war between <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> soldiers has forced the university to close temporarily. Several of its officials have been kidnapped. Adjoining the park-like university campus was the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where children of expatriate families studied and played Little League baseball. Some tried the pinball machines at <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON>'s, where many British and American boys, including my two sons, learned Arabic insults from local youngsters. Beirutis could ski at <LOCATION> Faraya </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, play tennis or squash and race in motor rallies. An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist who played at the <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, next to the now-closed airport, as late as 1983 wrote that the safest places on the course were the sand traps. The luxurious <ORGANIZATION> Delamiyeh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, with a gorgeous sea view from a ridge south of the city, was abandoned after <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas took it over early in the war. Will the old <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> ever return? No one knows, but I remember <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Saab </PERSON>, owner of Summerland, a functioning hotel built during the war. A television reporter asked why he made the investment, and <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> replied: `` Did you, as a child, ever kick over an anthill? Did you see how quickly the ants rebuilt? That's <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.''

 For centuries, the Thames has been a working river, a winding highway where barges, tall ships, then steamers brought the wealth of the world to one of its major commercial centers. Now it's also a popular excurison river, and Sunday's fatal collision of the pleasure cruise boat Marchioness and a dredger many times its size raises questions about whether there is room for both. Transport Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON> said Monday the government `` will obviously be looking very carefully'' at whether to ban pleasure cruisers from the river. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called for an immediate conference involving the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, the police and river users to discuss what can be done to improve safety. The Port of <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> says the <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> is like `` an eight-lane motorway,'' traveled by 37,000 vessels annually, but insists it is still one of the safest rivers in the world. `` There are very few incidents indeed on the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION>,'' a spokesman said. `` It's one of the safest in the world.'' The port says 25 companies are licensed to operate 40 river cruise boats, like the Marchioness, on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stretch of the Thames between <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> and Hampton Court Palace. `` They have certainly increased, the popularity has increased,'' said port spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatton </PERSON>, although river cruise operators disagreed. A ferry service was also launched last year, taking passengers from central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s business and financial districts to the booming Docklands residential and commercial development. An ocean liner dropped anchor in the Thames for the first time in a decade last year, the first of 25 booked up to 1991. The river cruisers carry about 2 million passengers annually. By day, they're full of tourists viewing <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> from a different angle, sailing past the Houses of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the Tower of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, or the <LOCATION> Kew </LOCATION> botanical gardens. By night, they become floating restaurants, cocktail lounges or discos, chartered for private parties. `` In recent years the growth of tourist boats on sightseeing trips has been accentuated by the popularity of business entertaining by firms hiring crafts to take customers up and down the river,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrindle </PERSON>. `` Add in the evening party types and the commercial traffic still using the river, and the feeling that the river may be catering for too many small ships leads me to call for reassurances about safety.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON>, chief executive of the Port of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said Sunday's accident involving the 90-ton Marchioness and the 1,475-ton dredger <PERSON> Bowbelle </PERSON> was `` clearly a navigational matter,'' and that the rules governing the passage of boats on the river may have to be reviewed. <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON> said taped VHF radio messages from the Bowbelle to the <ORGANIZATION> Thames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> were being examined. Commercial vessels must report their positions and progress along the river, particularly near bridges, but pleasure craft do not. `` If we required every small craft to report its every movement, the airwaves would be so cluttered it would be difficult to get out of that a picture of the really important pieces where things could possibly go wrong,'' <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON> said. Commercial ships have plied the Thames for 2,000 years, berthing originally at natural indentations in the river. Vessels later docked in the center of the river and loaded their cargoes onto barges to be taken ashore. River traffic surged in the 1890s when locks were built to control the strong tidal flow, and trade peaked in 1964 when 64 million tons were handled. When container shipping was introduced in the mid-1960s, cargo ships moved to deeper ports like Tilbury at the river's mouth. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s docks were n't big enough to handl the new, larger container ships. Pilots on the river have to undergo a five - or seven-year apprenticeship to become Freemen of the Watermen and <PERSON> Lightermen </PERSON>'s Company of the City of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, which dates from Members are also designated Queen's Watermen, responsible for rowing Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on the rare occasions she travels the Thames.

 Twenty-one years after it sent tanks to crush the `` Prague Spring'' reforms in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is watching quietly as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> takes its political changes even further, breaking the communist monopoly on power. The Soviet reaction to events in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, including the nomination of Solidarity journalist <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> as prime minister, indicated how <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has shaken up the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s relations with its Eastern European allies since Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> forces halted <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s reforms on Aug. 21, 1968 In contrast with <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is willing to allow his allies to find their own way as he experiments with reform at home and grapples with nationalist movements on his own side of the border. Even in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where reforms have proceeded the furthest, they apparently have not gone beyond what is now acceptable to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. It is no longer certain where that limit is. `` The formation of a government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is an internal affair of the Polish people,'' <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremitskykh </PERSON> told a news briefing Monday. `` At the same time, we are not indifferent to it. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is a neighbor and an ally,'' he said. `` We hope the political forces in the country will act constructively to find a way out of the crisis.'' <PERSON> Gremitskykh </PERSON> was reiterating the cautious Soviet reaction to events in the past several months as <LOCATION> Soldiarity </LOCATION> has been legalized and carried out a successful election campaign. In the meantime, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has not been able to form a government and President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> was forced to turn to Solidarity for a prime minister. Soviet officials last week expressed satisfaction at Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s statement that even a Solidarity-led government had responsibilities to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. In 1981, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> crushed Solidarity after it grew into a national movement, ending speculation that <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> would again use Soviet soldiers to bring a wayward ally back in line. Official Soviet TV and radio are reporting the events in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> but generally refraining from making judgments about the political situation. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda on Monday painted a grim picture of shortages of meat and other goods. It said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was on the brink of `` hyperinflation.'' Prospects of a coalition of Solidarity and two minor, non-communist parties were `` becoming all the more realistic,'' Pravda said. In contrast, it said the Polish <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was `` living through one of the most difficult periods of its history.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said several times in trips to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> believes its allies should be free to find their own road to developing socialism, depending on local conditions. Twenty-one years ago, on Aug. 21, 1968, <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact sent soldiers to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to end a reform spearheaded not by an organized opposition, but by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is reported to be frustrated with the conservative leadership in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> that has been in power since 1968 and continues to block reform. But the Soviet reaction to the anniversary of the invasion indicates a continuing sensitivity. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has never said that it made a mistake in sending soldiers into <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. In response to a question Monday about how the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> now views the invasion, <PERSON> Gremitskykh </PERSON> said only that it had to be understood in the context of the times. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet government newspaper, on Saturday printed remembrances of soldiers and Soviet officials who took part in the invasion. <PERSON> Kiril </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazurov </PERSON>, then a member of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s Politburo, said Soviet leaders had learned of plans `` to provoke a nuclear attack on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' `` The Central Committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovakia </ORGANIZATION> had lost control of the media. In the difficult international environment, we had just one wish _ to unite even more, to prevent a war, to survive together,'' he said. `` It was hard to imagine that a bourgeois parliamentary republic, swarming with West Germans and afterward Americans, might appear next to our borders,'' he said. V.V. <PERSON> Nefyodov </PERSON>, a 19-year-old paratrooper when he was sent to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> in 1968, told <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> he could not understand why he was sent to a country where the people did n't want him. `` I was ashamed,'' he said. `` Forgive us, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Interior Dismissed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has fired an acting deputy assistant secretary who failed to pass a security check, officials said Monday night. The official, <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dress </PERSON>, had agreed to resign in June, efffective July 31, but changed her mind last week and decided not to submit a resignation, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, press spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manual </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>. `` She was terminated,'' <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said. He said she was `` a fine employee'' and would not elaborate on why she was fired. The spokesman said <PERSON> Dress </PERSON> told her staff she was dismissed because she failed to pass her security investigation, something confirmed by other officials who spoke on condition they not be identified. Dress had been acting deputy assistant secretary for territorial and international affairs since early May. She had had no access to classified information pending completion of her security check, when she would have stepped up out of the `` acting'' category, <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said. The department's Office of Territorial and International Affairs is in charge of the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and relations with the trust territories and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependencies in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Just what classified information is involved was not immediately clear, but the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> areas contain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases. The deputy assistant's job does not require <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. Dress previously served in the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. After her appointment was announced, she attended a Rose Garden Ceremony where President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised her as one of the highest-ranking Asian-Americans in his administration. A woman who answered the telephone at the Dress home Monday night said she was `` not available.''

 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have pursued different paths in recent years, but they still have a lot in common.

 How does a North Korean buy a fancy watch, leather shoes and Japanese cigarettes in a country where such things theoretically require foreign currency? `` I have a lot of friends,'' said a North Korean with all three. As in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, one cultivates friends not just for company, but to skirt regulations and get access to scarce goods. Friendless North Koreans are worse than lonely: they are condemned to walk in flimsy plastic or cloth shoes and wait on long lines for the few public buses or trolleys that ply the broad avenues of this sprawling capital city. There are no private vehicles and no bicycles are allowed in downtown. `` I have friends who are -LRB- official -RRB- drivers,'' said the well-shod North Korean. `` If I want to take my family somewhere, I ask them, and they say, ` Sure.''' That could mean a trip in a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> or at worst in a <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION>, the only cars in North Korean official fleets. There is much in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to remind of life in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, its socialist big brother across the <LOCATION> Yalu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>: slow service, careful checks of travelers' identification and lots of uniformed soldiers around, although most are simply walking or standing along the road. As in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, interviews with officials often begin with a `` brief introduction'' that turns into an hour-long recitation of statistics and the official line. Officials give interviews in pairs: one who is introduced and who answers questions, and one who is never introduced but silently supervises. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s separate currencies for locals and foreigners confuse and annoy many visitors, but <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has three currencies. Ordinary pink-and-green won can buy the bare necessities: the cabbages, eggplant and hard-looking apples and pears on display at a <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> green-grocer's one recent morning. Foreigners who convert Soviet rubles get red bills and have a few more choices. But only holders of blue money, changed from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars, can buy <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kirin </ORGANIZATION> beer, Japanese televisions and British cigarettes. `` Friends who are diplomats and traders give -LRB- blue money -RRB- to me,'' said the well-connected North Korean, puffing on a Japanese Mild Seven cigarette. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> does n't have <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s hordes of youths openly trading the various currencies for illegal profit on the sidewalks, or the dozens of other symptoms in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> of crumbling official control. Chinese officials trying to reinstall past ideological unity after spring pro-democracy protests might well look to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for reminders on how it is done. Political slogans have faded from most walls in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the past decade, as senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> stressed economic development over ideology. But signs every few hundred meters in rural <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> still exhort, `` Long live the Great Leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>. Long live the glorious Workers' Party of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> never let its political education mechanisms rust, as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> did. Professor <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonsok </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said that in workplaces, `` political work is as important as production work.'' Perhaps most important, citizens in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have not been allowed the sense of independence that comes from being one's own boss. Private businessmen were key supporters of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s protests, but private farm plots in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> are kept tiny and there is virtually no other private economic activity. How far <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has strayed from such basics of old-time socialist rule was illustrated by the comments of two ethnic <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> women who live just inside the Chinese border. They spoke of visits to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> much as overseas Chinese used to talk of visiting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>: `` You and I can sit here and say what we like about <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>,'' said one, `` but they ca n't do that about <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is helped in its task of control by a smaller population _ 20 million people to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 1.2 billion _ and strong non-ideological unifying forces: a sense of outside threat, from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and the common goal of national reunification. Ordinary Koreans and officials spoke of these much more often than of juche, the official philosophy of Marxism and self-reliance. In the 1950s and 1960s, post-war reconstruction and the fear of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or Soviet attack helped unify <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but the 1970s and 1980s have seen increasing concern with individual goals. But the North Koreans have not given up all personal happiness for the glory of the nation. Even in a brief visit it was clear they still remember how to have a good time. Accordion music could be heard coming from several homes. A youth with a guitar serenaded friends on the sidewalk one night in <LOCATION> Kaesong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, near the border with the south. And on a sunny afternoon, several dozen young men in dirty blue work clothes went carousing at the nearby Pagyon Waterfalls. Red-faced and a bit wobbly, they sang and danced down the road home.

<HEAD>Blast Investigation Finds Many Problems, No Cause of Iowa Blast</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigation of the USS Iowa explosion which killed 47 sailors has found `` various things wrong'' with procedures aboard the battleship but none of them can be determined to be the specific cause of the blast, a defense official Monday. `` It does not point to the cause of the problem,'' the official said, `` The report cites a probability.'' The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was asked about reports that crew members of the No. 2 gun turret that blew up April 19 were not properly certified for their jobs or failed to follow maintenance procedures designed to prevent breakdown in the turret. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Tuesday editions that the naval investigation has found the crew faled to perform certain unspecified preventive maintenance procedures, but the newspaper added it was not known whether the faulty maintenance caused the explosion. The Post reported the No. 2 turret's guns passed pre-firing checks before the explosion. In a separate story, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, reported the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> failed to properly qualify the sailors who worked with the explosives in the turret. The report said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> requires that all who work at such posts be certified by a qualified board in order to handle the weapons. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Drowns </PERSON>, one of 11 sailors who escaped turret No. 2 after the April 19 explosion, told the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> a qualification board was never convened on the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> during his three years on the ship. Gunner's Mate 2nd Class <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullahy </PERSON> and a third <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> survivor, Gunner's Mate 3rd Class <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, said one of the sailors who lacked a qualification book showing facts about the guns was Gunner's Mate 3rd Class <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Backherms </PERSON>, the rammerman of the center gun where the explosion occurred. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Backherms </PERSON> joined the ship shortly after Christmas, was inexperienced and may have caused the blasts by ramming the bags of explosives into the gun too fast. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials would not confirm the details in the two newspaper reports. They said the results of the investigation are still in the chain of command and the review process is not completed. `` Until then, we are not in a position to comment,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Cmdr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the investigaive process is not finished while the report remains in the chain of command and the chief of <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION>, Adm. <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>, has not made it public. `` As far as we're concerned, it's all still under investigation,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is expected to make the report public in early September. The report was prepared under the guidance of Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> and was sent last weel to top officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, where it is being reviewed by `` a very tightly controlled group of people,'' another <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> source said. `` Only a few people currently are working on it. As far as I know there are no civilians in the group and it's next stop will be on the desk of the chief of <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION>,'' the source said. However, the defense official said he was told the report will show a number of `` lapses in procedures,'' but he said he could not identify them. `` The investigation found various things wrong about procedures. But none of them has been found to be the cause,'' the official said. The official said the investigation has gone deeply into details of the ship's operations, which means multiple problems could be found in such a complex operation as a battleship firing its guns. `` There were lapses in procedures, but to cite just maintenance problems would be nitpicking. It does not point to the cause of the problem,'' the official said.

 A south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> city is fighting to protect the springs that make it a desert oasis from a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> proposal to rock a nearby ranch with a series of massive underground explosions. The proposed explosions on the Buck King Ranch near <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, are an important element in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategic deterrent capabilities, says the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The non-nuclear explosions are designed to simulate the impact of nuclear blasts on subterranean missile silos and military command centers. But 12,000 of the 40,000 <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> residents have signed petitions asking the agency to take its explosives elsewhere. They say they do n't want to take any chances with the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border city's only source of water, the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Felipe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. `` We depend on <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Felipe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> for survival,'' says City Manager <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomeranz </PERSON>. `` The city of <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> is not willing to play a what-if game with our water and the future of our city. `` No one in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has offered us any guarantees, nor can they, that if our water supply was adversely affected, the federal government would step in and correct the situation,'' he said. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> also has expressed concern to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials about the potential impact of the explosions near the border, said <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. Defense Nuclear Agency officials, however, say a final decision to conduct the tests hinges on geological and environmental assessments of the area that are not yet completed. The agency spent two years choosing the site 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> for the graduated series of explosions. The explosions would start with a 1,000-pound charge in 1990, increasing to 470 tons _ equivalent to 300 tons of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> _ in November 1992. Defense spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheri </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdelnour </PERSON> said the tests would be performed with the same conventional explosives used by the mining industry, and do not involve nuclear or radioactive devices. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachkosky </PERSON>, director of plans, programs and requirements for the defense agency, said the tests are `` important to the continued credibility and viability of our strategic deterrent.'' `` As an agency, our primary responsibility to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> is to ensure the survivability of our strategic assets and the effectiveness of those same assets when used against anyone who might threaten our security,'' he said. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> officials were told the purpose of the tests was to `` determine the survivability of underground missile silos and foreign missile silos and other underground military facilities,'' <PERSON> Pomeranz </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> residents say water in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is more important. Last week they became even more skittish when an underground cave-in contaminated their water with an unknown substance, forcing them to drink boiled or bottled water for two days. Just as the springs are tied to the city's future, they are part of its past, with the first <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> explorers writing about the springs in their chronicles. Long before it was settled, <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> was an oasis on the long, dry trail between <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pomeranz </PERSON> said. `` Del Rio's entire growth and development is centered around the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Felipe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Pomeranz </PERSON> said. On Friday, <PERSON> Pomeranz </PERSON> and Mayor <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Bachkosky </PERSON> and Vice Adm. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> director, to ask that the drilling for the core samples be abandoned. `` What we're saying is, we've got 12,000 signatures of <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rioans </PERSON> who want the project stopped and the city of <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> is going to do everything possible to protect our citizens,'' <PERSON> Pomeranz </PERSON> said. `` Therefore, let's stop the test drilling now, and look for another site.''

 Federal Reserve policymakers, meeting privately today, likely will decide against lowering interest rates soon despite pressure from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, analysts say. The Federal Open Market Committee, which controls the benchmark federal funds rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans, is devising the central bank's monetary strategy for the next six weeks. But, as usual under the committee's procedure, the results wo n't be publicly disclosed until Oct. 6, three days after the next meeting Most analysts expected the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to hold interest rates steady unless it sees unexpected signs that economic growth is fizzling. `` I do n't think they're going to do much of anything right now,'' said economist <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>. `` They can say their policies are working pretty much as desired. The economy is still moving up and the inflation numbers have been fairly good.'' The central bank, which tries to regulate the nation's economy by manipulating interest rates, has been engaged in a delicate balancing act over the past 18 months. It is trying to hold inflation in check by moderating economic growth but at the same time keep the country from toppling into what would be the first recession since 1982. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried last week to tip the balance in favor of lower rates, which would stimulate economic growth and revenue to the government. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsed comments by his budget director, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, who said it would be the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s fault if the economy falls into a recession. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, however, warned that such lobbying of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, a fiercely independent agency, may backfire. `` If anything, it causes them to dig in their heels,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> believes economic growth of only a little more than 2 percent a year is sustainable without fueling inflation, but the administration is looking for growth closer to 3 percent this year to help it reduce the federal budget deficit. `` In a $ 5 trillion economy, that's not peanuts,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` In fact, for every 1 percent increase in growth, Mr. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> gets an extra $ 25 billion in revenue to help ease the budget deficit.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said there is a split in the 12-member <ORGANIZATION> FOMC </ORGANIZATION>, which consists of seven <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> governors _ although there is one vacancy _ and five presidents of regional <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION>. Board members have tended to favor easier money, while regional bank presidents have leaned toward tighter policy, he said. Board member <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that he believed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has succeeded in curbing inflation, which he predicted would decline from about 5 percent a year to about 3 percent. Earlier last week however, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoskins </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, told bankers at a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> forum that they believed economic growth was accelerating, a sign that inflation wo n't subside. At least for now, it's hard to say for sure which faction is right, economists say. The Fed only recently began easing its tight money policy. From March 1988 to March 1989, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> pushed short-term interest rates up by 3 percentage points in an effort to curb the economy and bring inflationary pressures under control. It paused for several months and then in early June, as signs of sluggish growth emerged, reversed course and began to push rates lower. Now, as economic reports come in for July, it appears the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has exactly what it wants. The most recent data suggests the economy has recovered a bit from sluggishness in the April-June quarter. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s index of industrial production rose in July after falling the two previous months. And new home construction rebounded in June and July from four consecutive monthly declines. Consumer price inflation, which from January through May soared at the worst rate in seven years, averaging 0.5 percent to 0.6 percent each month, fell to 0.2 percent in both June and July.

 When a new home is offered for sale, even in the heart of big-city suburbia, it very often adds to farm income with an eye-catching display of freshly planted shrubs and green sod almost ready to mow. Add cut flowers and floral arrangements for weddings, funerals, lovers, <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> and sick friends and you have horticulture _ one of the fastest developing sectors in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture. Since 1982, says an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economist, the horticulture industry has grown an average of 10 percent a year. Preliminary figures for 1988 show that producers of horticultural products had cash receipts totaling $ 6.9 billion, which was more than 9 percent of the $ 72.4 billion received by farmers last year for all crops. For example, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> statistics, the $ 6.9 billion for flowers, shrubs, sod and other greenery exceed 1988 cash receipts for cotton, $ 4.7 billion, and tobacco, $ 2.04 billion, and was creeping up on feed crops _ including corn _ $ 7.68 billion. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the industry was in two sectors. Floriculture includes cut flowers, potted flowering plants, bedding plants and cut cultivated greens such as ferns used in arrangements. The other is environmental horticulture, which includes all other nursery and greenhouse products. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s analysis of the rapid growth of the horticulture industry is in the September issue of <LOCATION> Farmline </LOCATION> magazine. `` One of the reasons for the increase in horticultural sales is that the housing industry is spending more for sod and other landscape ornamentals,'' the report said. `` Also, cities are doing more landscaping in the inner cities as well as in parks and along highways.'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> accounts for about 23 percent of total horticultural sales, followed by <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, nearly 15 percent, and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 7 percent. Of 2 million farms in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, there are fewer than 38,000 horticultural operations. But in 1987, the most recent statistics available, those had sales averaging $ 154,818 each, compared with $ 65,165 for all farms. There are an estimated 57,000 retail floral outlets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the report said. Mass-market outlets, mostly grocery stores, account for 21,000, but the majority, an estimated 36,000, are independent retail floral shops. According to 1986 figures, grocery store sales of flowers and plants amounted to $ 1.49 billion, averaging $ 28 per square feet of store space, compared with $ 8 to $ 12 for other produce, the report said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the world's largest producer of flowers and plants, and American growers control about 95 percent of the domestic market, the report said. But imports are important, totaling $ 451 million last year. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is the largest source of the imports, the report said. Others include the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.

 British wine drinkers offer a potential growth market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fondahn </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural trade officer in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, says per capita wine consumption in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> grew from 2 liters in 1967 to 12 liters in 1987. `` It currently is the only growth market in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for wine,'' he said. `` With 41 supplying countries, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> has become the most sought after wine market in the world.'' <PERSON> Fondahn </PERSON> said in the September issue of AgExporter magazine that the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> imports 57.4 million cases of wine annually, compared with domestic production of 9.4 million cases. Although the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market share is less than 1 percent, last year's sales of American wine to the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> rose 20 percent to 550,000 cases, he said. Consumers prefer white wines over red, although there has been substantial increases in red and rose wines lately. `` The most dramatic development in wine sales in recent years has been the establishment of wine bars,'' <PERSON> Fondahn </PERSON> said. `` These establishments have introduced a large segment of the population to a variety of wines. Many of the wine bars offer their wines by the case for home consumption.'' <PERSON> Fondahn </PERSON> said that as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> must comply with <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> requirements for the importation of wine. These requirements can be stringent and, in some cases, can hinder the sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wine in the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION>, he said.

 Catfish production continues to increase, but the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says producers are getting lower prices than they did a year ago. Production in July totaled 27.8 million pounds of live weight delivered to processing plants, the department said Monday in its monthly report. That was up 17 percent from July 1988. But prices paid to growers averaged 71 cents per pound, down 9 cents a pound from a year earlier, the report said. Production through the first seven months of 1989 totaled 196.6 million pounds, up 16 percent from the same period last year.

 The nation's battles against drugs, AIDS, tax cheats and dangerous airways could be undermined unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> implements an agreement to cut the budget deficit, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration says. Such spending programs may have to be arbitrarily cut _ and $ 8.1 billion taken from the military budget _ unless the 1990 deficit is reduced to the level allowed by law, says <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. However, in a report to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said across-the-board spending cuts are avoidable. `` It remains my hope, and my cautiously optimistic expectation, that necessary legislation'' cutting selected programs and raising revenues can be enacted when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns Sept. 5, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said. The government can avoid the across-the-board reductions if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will implement a budget-cutting agreement reached with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in April, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said. He noted that almost none of that agreement has been enacted into law. The deficit is on a path that, in the absence of further congressional action, would lead to $ 116.2 billion of red ink during the 1990 budget year, which begins Oct. 1. That's down from about $ 170 billion this year. The law limits the 1990 deficit to $ 100 billion. As a result of the estimate, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> told reporters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will issue an order Friday to cut _ `` sequester'' in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> jargon _ $ 16.2 billion worth of spending, half from the military budget and half from most non-military programs. But that order will be only a warning; the real cuts would not be ordered until Oct. 15. In his report, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> listed specific cuts that would be required in specific programs, ranging from a $ 1 billion slash in salaries and benefits for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to a $ 7 million reduction in health benefits for retired federal workers. Among the effects that could occur, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said, are:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ A cut below this year's level in funds for the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which `` could undermine its ability to wage an aggressive war on drugs. The Coast Guard might have to ground aircraft needed for critical interdiction activities. _ Reductions `` would severely hamper the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to prevent HIV -LRB- the AIDS virus -RRB- transmission and conduct research into therapies and vaccines _ The effect on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> `` could include a furlough of up to three days per month of all <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> staff, including air traffic control and maintenance personnel. _ <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> funding would be reduced; the agency could lose 4,700 workers, meaning 10 million fewer taxpayer-assistance calls could be answered and fewer returns could be audited _ About 1 million needy college students would lose federal education grants _ The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> might be forced to cut 160,000 personnel Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, predicted that once the smoke clears, `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is going to lurch across the finish line'' and avoid the arbitrary cuts. Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the committee, cautioned that `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should not be lulled to sleep by <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>'s artificially low deficit projections Even with these dubious economic and spending assumptions, we face the possibility of harsh across-the-board spending cuts this fall ... and ... we still need $ 30 billion to $ 60 billion in additional deficit reduction for 1991.'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> also noted a greater effort will be required a year from now to cut the deficit further. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s opposition to a tax increase is unchanged, he said. `` We still say revenues -LRB- tax increases -RRB- do n't have to be on the -LRB- negotiating -RRB- table for 1991.''

 For American parents, the old-time preference for boys seems to be giving way to a desire for a child of each sex. Parents with two boys or two girls are quicker to have a third child than those with one of each gender, report researchers <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schollaert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Teachman </PERSON>. And, contrary to their expectations, parents who have a son first try again slightly sooner than those who start with a daughter, they report in the August edition of Demography, the journal of the <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` The American norm really is a boy-girl family,'' Schollaert, of <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dominion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview. That finding, he added, could ease fears that the ability to select the gender of children could lead to an excess of boys. `` Our results are straightforward. The gender of children affects birth timing. Yet it is not whether a child is a boy or a girl that is important,'' reported <PERSON> Teachman </PERSON> and Schollaert. `` Women with two boys or two girls are more likely to time a third birth rapidly than are women with a boy and a girl,'' they said. Their conclusions were based on an analysis of births to more than 2,000 women, reported in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growth </ORGANIZATION> in 1973, 1976 and 1982. By recording births every six months they were able to compare whether women in one group had births before those in other groups. They did not report the actual length of time between births, however. Were they surprised that parents who had sons first were quicker to have a second child than those who had a daughter first? `` Oh, we were,'' responded Schollaert. In many societies there is a strong preference for boys, leading to the killing of female babies in some countries, <PERSON> Schollaert </PERSON> said. Past studies in this country have indicated a slight preference for boys. `` So, logic is that if you tried once and had a daughter you'd be more likely to go try again quickly,'' he said. `` What, we found, to the contrary, was that those who had sons were more likely to have a rapid -LRB- second -RRB- birth,'' he said. However, he explained that the slight preference for boys still might be the reason. <PERSON> Schollaert </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Teachman </PERSON> found that `` couples that have sons are slightly more likely to stay married, and, of course, the most powerful determinant of whether you have another child in short order is ` are you married.''' Tradition has it that people prefer boys, and that slight preference in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society has a bearing, he said. Fathers are `` more likely to be involved with their sons than their daughters. This involvement leads to greater familial ties and interdependencies that work against marital dissolution,'' said <PERSON> Teachman </PERSON> and Schollaert. Studies have found that parents who have a daughter first are somewhat more likely to divorce than those who have a son. Thus, women with sons were more likely to remain married and to have a second child. Women with daughters, being more likely to be divorced or separated, had a reduced likelihood of having second children, they concluded.

<HEAD>Fed Won't Penalize Japanese-Owned Securities Companies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is passing up an opportunity to penalize Japanese-owned securities companies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, instead praising <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for making `` substantial'' progress in opening its markets to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. The board voted 5-1 Monday to allow Japanese-owned companies to continue operating as primary dealers of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> debt. A staff report concluded the Japanese government offered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies a fair chance to participate in its debt sales. `` Much progress has been made,'' the report said. `` The structure of the -LRB- Japanese -RRB- market now compares favorably with the state of development in other industrial countries, and the actions that have been taken in recent years to open the market are substantial.'' In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, any company may buy <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> debt. However, only 42 _ 11 fully or partly Japanese-owned _ are designated by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> as primary dealers, eligible to trade securities with the central bank as part of its regulation of the economy. Omnibus trade legislation passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a year ago required the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to remove foreign-owned companies from the primary dealer list if their nations did n't afford `` the same competitive opportunities'' to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> runs a persistent deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the trade of goods. One of the ways it makes up part of that gap is through the trade of services such as those offered by securities companies. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who pushed for the securities provision in the trade bill, said he agreed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had made enough progress to avoid sanctions. However, he said the central bank should have been more critical. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s decision that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s markets are fully competitive is premature,'' he said in a statement. `` While I agree <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has made progress ... the markets are not even close to fully competitive.'' Legislators have warned that unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> insists on full access to Japanese financial markets, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> brokerage industry will slip behind in international competition, as have <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto and steel companies. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> staff conceded the barriers to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in Japanese government debt markets had existed, but noted a major improvement this year. In April, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> began selling 40 percent of its 10-year bonds, the most important government security issued, through a competitive auction, leaving 60 percent to be sold through negotiation with a syndicate of securities companies and banks. Previously, all 10-year bonds had been sold through the syndicate. The staff also noted that foreign participation in the syndicate has increased from about 1 percent in 1986 to 8 percent last year. The Japanese buy about a third of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's long-term bonds, according to analysts. Board member <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Seger </PERSON> dissented, noting that the law requires <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to offer `` the same competitive opportunities,'' not simply to improve. In particular, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies still complain that Japanese officials provide advance information to Japanese companies on government economic data, putting other companies at a disadvantage. However, the central bank staff said the Japanese have taken steps to curb this abuse and that `` further steps are expected.''

<HEAD>Federal Deficit Smaller Than Last Year, But Spending to Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal deficit through July is running 13 percent behind last year, but analysts and the government say savings and loan bailout spending will swell the budget gap in August and September. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that the government posted a smaller-than-expected deficit of $ 18.2 billion in July, the 10th month of the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. It attributed the 20.4 percent decline from July 1988 to a shift in payment dates for military salaries, veterans' benefits and Supplemental Security Income. Those payments, normally made July 1, were shifted to June 30 because July 1 fell on a Saturday. The shift caused the government to record a smaller-than-usual $ 7.8 billion surplus in June, normally a more positive month because people and corporations make quarterly tax payments. Through July, the deficit totals $ 123.8 billion, 13 percent lower than the same period for fiscal 1988. `` This is a good news-bad news story,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The good news is the July deficit is lower than expected. The bad news is that August and September will see substantial increases in <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> borrowing because of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout.'' The thrift rescue law signed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Aug. 9 will add $ 20 billion in borrowing. So far this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> has expanded its borrowing by $ 5 billion and officials say they intend to borrow the remaining $ 15 billion in the next six weeks. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had been forecasting a 1989 deficit of $ 148.3 billion, an improvement over the 1988 red ink of $ 155.2 billion. But, Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said Monday the administration expects just under $ 170 billion in red ink. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> forecasts a $ 161 billion deficit for this year. Revenue last month totaled $ 66.3 billion, up 9.2 percent from a year ago, while spending was up only 1.1 percent to $ 84.5 billion. As usual, the government's largest spending category last month was military spending, which totaled $ 20.5 billion in July and $ 241.8 billion so far this year, up 2 percent from 1988. Other large spending categories were: _ Interest on the national debt, the fastest growing item: $ 16 billion last month and $ 207.3 billion so far in fiscal 1989, up 12.9 percent from the previous year _ Social Security: $ 18.6 billion in July and $ 188.7 billion so far this year, up 6 percent from 1988 _ Other programs in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>: $ 13.1 billion last month and $ 141.6 billion so far in 1989, up 8.3 percent from a year earlier

<TEXT>
 Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> is offering to negotiate with 11 governors over environmental monitoring of federal nuclear facilities within their borders. The states _ <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ are hosts to a variety of <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> defense nuclear facilities, including nuclear reactors, processing plants, weapons assembly facilities and waste treatment and storage operations. The department said Monday that it wanted to reach agreements that would allow the states to independently validate the department's own environmental monitoring data, and to involve the states in setting priorities and schedules for nuclear waste cleanup. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the deputy energy secretary, said the proposed agreements would be `` unprecedented in their scope and in the degree of access to DOE facilities that will be provided to the states.'' He said the accords would be similar to a model agreement signed June 28 by <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> over state access to the Rocky Flats nuclear plant near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had vigorously opposed state actions to enforce hazardous waste laws at defense nuclear facilities, but President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has taken a more accommodating view in the wake of disclosures about mismanagement and possible criminal violations of environmental laws at some plants.

The full court ruling came shortly after a three-judge panel ruled 2-1 that <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> should be released. The court, in its one-page order, called for a new hearing on <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s appeal of the civil contempt of court citation that has kept her at the city jail for two years. The prominent plastic surgeon was jailed Aug. 28, 1987, by <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> for failing to produce her daughter, <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>, for visits with Dr. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s former husband and the girl's father. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said she hid the girl because <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> had sexually abused the child. <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> denies the allegations. <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>, whose 7th birthday was Monday, remains hidden. <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> was joined on the Capitol steps by about a dozen relatives and supporters to mark his daughter's birthday. In Monday's majority opinion by the three-judge panel, Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferren </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s attempt to coerce <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> into divulging the girl's whereabouts had failed.

<HEAD>$3.4 Billion Needed for Cleanup of 10 Sites: Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Creative financing such as taxes on polluters should be considered to pay for the multibillion-dollar cost of cleaning up the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, a new study says. The <ORGANIZATION> Northeast-Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which does research for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from 18 states, estimated that up to $ 3.4 billion will be needed to restore 10 of the lakes' dirtiest areas. `` The real challenge right now ... is how to pay for the cleanup,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ann </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, said Monday. Federal funds are available through a variety of programs to help with the cleanup, such as the Superfund for toxic wastes. But the institute report urges <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to establish a trust fund, or `` aquafund,'' with money from new taxes on water users and manufacturers of the chemicals found in harbor and river sediment. A U.S.-Canadian commission has classified 42 areas as so polluted they are unfit for swimming, drinking, fishing and, in some cases, navigation. Estimates of cleanup costs have been made for 10 of those areas: <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> <PERSON> River-Green </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Waukegan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Calumet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River-Indiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Saginaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River-Saginaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Clinton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, all in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ashtabula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River-Harbor </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> Embayment in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The estimated cost of cleaning up all 10 areas is $ 2.9 billion to $ 3.4 billion, the report said. However, it said that estimate is probably too low because cleanup costs have been set for only 19 of the 55 contamination sources identified at the sites.

<HEAD>Investigation Finds Many Problems, No Cause of Iowa Blast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Procedures aboard the USS Iowa are the focus of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigation into an explosion that killed 47 sailors, but a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official says the specific cause of the blast ca n't be determined. Reports published in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, say the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> report found that crew members failed to perform preventive maintenance and that sailors were n't properly certified for their jobs The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, which says the report on the April 19 explosion will be made public next month, refused to comment on either story. `` As far as we're concerned, it's all still under investigation,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Cmdr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke Monday on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> report `` does not point to the cause of the problem. The report cites a probability.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions that the investigation has found the crew failed to perform certain unspecified preventive maintenance procedures. However, the newspaper said it was not known whether the faulty maintenance caused the explosion. The No. 2 turret's guns passed pre-firing checks before the explosion, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> failed to properly qualify the sailors who worked with explosives in the turret. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> regulations require that all sailors and civilian employees who work with explosives be certified at their posts by a Qualification Board. Sailors who lack certification are permitted to handle weapons only in the presence of a supervisor. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Drowns </PERSON>, one of 11 sailors who escaped turret No. 2 after the explosion, told the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that a Qualification Board was never convened during his three years on the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Drowns received an honorable discharge from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Aug. 11. Other <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> sailors and a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer familiar with the investigation confirmed Drowns' statements, but asked that they not be identified for fear of retribution by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>, who headed the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s probe, said no records of a <ORGANIZATION> Qualification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> had been found on the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, a source told the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> has declined to comment publicly. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported last month that investigators believed the explosion was the result of suicidal sabotage by Gunner's Mate <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said July 19 that the conclusion of suicide was not based on official <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> reports. The defense official said Monday that he was told the report would show a number of `` lapses in procedures,'' but he said he could not identify them. `` The investigation found various things wrong about procedures. But none of them has been found to be the cause,'' he said. The investigation has gone into details of the ship's operations, which means multiple problems could be found in such a complex operation as a battleship firing its guns, he said. `` There were lapses in procedures, but to cite just maintenance problems would be nitpicking. It does not point to the cause of the problem,'' the official said. Drowns and another survivor, Gunner's Mate 2nd Class <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullahy </PERSON>, said the turret's senior enlisted man, Senior Chief Gunner's Mate <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>, was concerned before the explosion about the lack of qualification booklets. <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>, one of the 47 sailors who died, had given photocopied pages of the Performance Qualification Standard booklets to some sailors. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> regulations require that sailors have the books. <PERSON> Mullahy </PERSON> and another survivor, Gunner's Mate 3rd Class <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, said one of the sailors who lacked a book was Gunner's Mate 3rd Class <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Backherms </PERSON>, the rammerman of the center gun where the explosion occurred. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Backherms </PERSON> joined the ship shortly after Christmas, was inexperienced and may have caused the blast by ramming the bags of explosives into the gun too fast.

 A panel of 12 churchgoers was selected to try <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> while the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder's wife pleaded on the couple's television show for money from the faithful The jury selected Monday includes Baptists, Presbyterians and Catholics, most of whom said they attend church regularly and give to their church, but do not watch PTL or other religious television programs. `` Our faith is in God,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> proclaimed as he strode into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Courthouse with his attorneys and daughter. Back in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, carried on their live television broadcast, urging viewers to send money and pray for her husband. `` Everything that has to do with <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> television is on trial when <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> walks in that courtroom,'' she said shortly after the `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> Show'' opened Monday morning. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who has pleaded innocent, is charged with eight counts of mail fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. If convicted on all counts, he could face 120 years in prison and $ 5 million in fines. Earlier this month, former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> Executive Vice President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, who was indicted with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, pleaded guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy. Last month, former <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> aides <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> were convicted of tax evasion. All three are potential government witnesses. In jury selection Monday, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> questioned 49 people about their religious affiliation, whether they had ever donated to television evangelists, how regularly they attended church and whether they had ever been `` born again,'' had a deep religious experience or felt they had been called by God into a vocation. Seven jurors were dismissed, including four who said they could not put aside their opinions to give <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> a fair trial. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> warned the jurors not to discuss the case with anyone before opening arguments begin next Monday. Prosecutors and defense attorneys are under a gag order imposed by <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, and would not discuss jury selection. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> left by a side door after jury selection was completed. Besides the Taggarts and <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said the potential witnesses at the trial included several former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board members, including actor <PERSON> Efrem </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimbalist </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Cookman </PERSON>, the Assemblies of God superintendent from <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was listed as a possible defense witness. <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, whom <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> paid money to stay quiet about a sexual encounter with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> evangelist <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, who took over the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> empire in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> quit in March 1987, were not mentioned as possible witnesses. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his attorneys have declined to discuss their defense strategy, but he has said he knew little about <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s finances. Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> stayed in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> transplanted his ministry, to carry on their daily live broadcast. `` We need you to really pray for him,'' a tearful Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told viewers. The <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> have pleaded with supporters to contribute $ 1 million for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s defense fund. A letter sent two months ago said half of that amount had to be raised by the end of the month. Ministry officials have declined to say how much has been raised. It was earlier appeals for $ 1,000 donations to buy `` lifetime partnerships'' at the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry that landed <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> in federal court. Prosecutors say he and top aides at the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> ministry diverted more than $ 4 million of the $ 158 million contributed under various partnership programs to their personal uses. The <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> lived in a $ 1.3 million parsonage in <LOCATION> Tega </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, where they had an air-conditioned dog house. Their condo in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> had gold-plated faucets and mirrored walls that would give a view of the ocean from all directions.

 <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> says she is confident her husband will be acquitted of fraud and bribery charges in the diversion of $ 4 million from the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> television ministry. While <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> went on trial Monday in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> continued their new `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>'' shows to eight cable TV outlets around the country. In a live broadcast from their makeshift TV studio at a shopping mall in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said the government was doing everything it could to keep their church off the air. But she added, raising a fist, `` We're going to win!'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who has pleaded innocent, is charged with diverting $ 4 million from the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> treasury to support a lavish lifestyle. During the television show, Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> shed tears, giggled and prayed with her guests and 35 members of a studio audience. Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said there were `` terrible things happening in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. ... It's like a circus. `` Not only <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> is on trial, but I believe the church is on trial,'' she said. She blew a kiss to her husband, whom she said would be watching the program, and said: `` I love you sweetheart. Be a brave soldier. Do n't you dare give up.'' She also urged supporters to call a special pledge line to make donations, saying that the new TV ministry, which began broadcasting from here earlier this year, may have to go off the air because of `` a mountain of finances'' and debts of $ 200,000 she and her husband incurred months ago. But she made no direct mention of a special $ 1 million legal defense fund which the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> started last month. Phones jangled sporadically throughout the broadcast as volunteers answered callers pledging money. The show also included inspirational stories from the Rev. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Harthern </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawsey </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retreat </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> were given `` spiritual refuge'' for several months after leaving their home near <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harthern </PERSON> told the TV audience that `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> has repented and he's sincere. Later, the minister told reporters that he was there because `` <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> needs a friend. I'm not trying to condone or condemn. If he's guilty, only God and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> know whether it was intentional. I'm convinced there is sincere repentance.''

<HEAD>Peace Efforts Stall as Differences Emerge in Palestinian Uprising</HEAD>

 Palestinians are in a state of political turmoil as sharp differences have emerged over the future direction of the 20-month-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. The tensions, which coincided with greater violence aimed at Israelis and among Palestinians themselves, come at a time of rising frustration over the lack of progress in the U.S.-PLO dialogue and in efforts to arrange negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Prominent Palestinians argue the internal debate has not shaken the underlying commitment to continue the intefadeh, or uprising, as the only way to spur negotiations and achieve an independent state. `` Internally, we have some difficulties. We are in the midst of a re-evaluation of our tactics. But the dialogue is healthy,'' said <PERSON> Ghassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>, a lecturer at <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Leftists are urging the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to make no further compromises on the diplomatic front, and some are pushing for more violent actions, such as the use of weapons, to pressure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in what they see as a long-term war of attrition. At the same time, some of the uprising's more ambitious tactics have flopped, increasing fears among some Palestinians that the credibility of the underground leadership could be undermined. For example, many workers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> ignored a call from the pro-PLO underground to stage a week-long sympathy strike for collegues in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> who were refusing to accept new Israeli identity cards. `` The leadership should n't make calls that they ca n't implement,'' said <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON> Disunity also arose recently in public in several <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools where <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s followers urged students to attend classes during a general strike and met opposition from leftists who feared it would undermine solidarity. In <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Askar </PERSON> refugee camp, about 150 supporters of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> wearing black headdresses engaged in fistfights over the school issue with 50 members of <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions wearing red headdresses <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> journalist said `` lack of discipline'' in the uprising also was apparent in a new tendency by Palestinians to break with a publicly proclaimed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> policy of restraint and launch individual actions, some of them violent. The underground leadership is `` asking people daily to sacrifice their lives, but people are not seeing tangible changes and their endurance and patience with the leadership becomes thin,'' <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> said. As a result, he said, there were more `` uncontrolled actions'' such as the lone Palestinian who, to avenge the beating of a friend by soldiers, forced a bus off a highway July 6, killing 16 Jews and injuring 25 others. Despite a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> order not to use weapons, army statistics obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> show there were 12 incidents of Palestinians using firearms against Israelis and alleged Arab collaborators from July 9 to Aug. 9 _ more than in all of 1988. Overall, there also appears to be a new hard line developing. At an eight-day conference in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> this month, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> produced a final communique reaffirming the guerrilla faction's commitment to armed struggle The statement contrasted with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s earlier pledges to abandon terror and accept <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> also hinted to reporters in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> that more violent actions were under consideration, saying a lack of progress in the U.S.-PLO talks could result in the uprising becoming a `` nationwide rebellion ... and we may take another step after the rebellion.'' The more militant mood was also evident in the latest leaflet issued by the PLO-backed <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> of the Uprising. It advocated a greater use of knives in attacks on Israelis. The communique also reflected leftist views in taking an unexpectedly strong position against Palestinians meeting with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials such as Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jamil </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarifi </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> lawyer from <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, left for <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and skipped a planned conference with visiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> after graffiti threatened his life for earlier meeting with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. `` Shame on <PERSON> Jamil </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarifi </PERSON> and anybody who meets with killers of our people,'' said one slogan on a wall in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> <PERSON> Saftawi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activist with close ties to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, said that despite the warning he would press ahead with a 10-point peace proposal he recently presented to <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>. `` I call on my brothers not to be quick in taking decisions before they see the results of such meetings,'' he said in an interview. Other signs of internal upheaval include leaflets accusing prominent activists of corruption and a surge of attacks on Palestinians who are accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The attacks, usually carried out at night by masked enforcers, have claimed 97 lives and been criticized as harming the uprising's non-violent image Israeli troops have killed 540 Palestinians during the uprising, which began Dec. 8, 1987. The Rev. <PERSON> Audeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Rantisi </PERSON>, former deputy mayor of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, said in an interview that, `` It's not right to take the life of anyone,'' adding, some killings may mask `` personal rivalries.''

Eight people, including a 4-month-old, were injured when the bomb went off Monday as workers at the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> office opened a package that arrived by mail earlier that morning. Caustic gas, `` similar to tear gas,'' spread from the office of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> through air-conditioning ducts into surrounding offices in a two-story brick building near downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said Assistant Fire Chief <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. No one was seriously hurt, according to officials at <ORGANIZATION> Grady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Officers from the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> police and the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> arson squad were investigating the bombing, <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We'll be looking to see what jurisdiction, if any, we've got. ... Our interest is from the point of view of civil rights,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Special Agent Diader <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON>. `` Anytime something like this would come to the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> office, you have to believe it's racially motivated,'' said Democratic Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a veteran of the civil rights movement who was speaking nearby to a community group when he heard about the bombing. `` This is just a terrible experience,'' said <PERSON> Murlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, a staff secretary in the office. `` We've never experienced anything like this before in the 20 years I've worked here.'' The package arrived via <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` Priority Mail,'' <PERSON> Shinhoster </PERSON> said. It was addressed to the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> and not to anyone in particular. The return address proved to be a law office on <LOCATION> Peachtree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Police interviewed people at the firm, but said they suspect the address was listed as a hoax.

 Black community leaders, citing racial factors in legal proceedings against the nation's longest-standing death row inmate, are urging that his life be spared. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, on death row nearly 15 years, had faced execution today for his role in the torture-murders of three whites at an Ogden stereo shop. The victims and two survivors were forced to drink liquid drain cleaner before being shot in the head. The 34-year-old former airman from <LOCATION> Jonesboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, won a reprieve Saturday when a federal appellate court ordered a stay based on a writ of habeas corpus that claimed the court showed a racial bias in excluding a black man as a juror in Andrews' trial. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, president of the Ogden chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> and father of the juror who was excluded, said the death sentence reflects prevailing attitudes in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, which he labeled a `` racist state.'' Then-prosecutor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Newey </PERSON> has acknowledged that race played a part in his decision to exclude <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as a juror. Defense attorneys incorporated that statement into their appeal, but the state has countered that <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>' trial attorney concurred in a motion to dismiss the younger <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, because he was a state lawman at the time. The younger <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, now an administrator in the state prison system, has not disputed the logic behind his exclusion as a juror, but said race had played a part in the case. In his writ that led to the stay by the 10th <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> argued that a mistrial should have been declared during his trial when a juror found a note in a restaurant during a lunch break saying, `` Hang the niggers.'' The juror gave the note to the judge; its origin was never determined. The elder <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> noted that avowed white supremacist <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> had been sentenced to life imprisonment for gunning down two black men, Ted Fields and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, at a <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> park in 1980. `` No one seemed upset when Mrs. Fields and Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s sons were killed,'' <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said. `` That was premeditated murder.'' He said <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> had gotten the death sentence because, `` It's a black person that killed a white person.'' <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, convicted of two counts of first-degree murder, was given concurrent life sentences when the jury could not agree on the death penalty. He also was convicted in federal court and is serving life terms for violating the victims' civil rights. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Maye </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, attended a service Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> Calvary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, saying she had come to pray for <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, his family and all black children because `` there is no justice for them.'' `` <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> is a pretty good state, yes, if you are white,'' said <PERSON> Alberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. `` <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, he may still die even after this stay. But God help <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> if he does, for <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> will never live it down.'' <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> political science professor <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a civil right activist, said he did not feel race was the dominant issue in the case. He noted that <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> and his co-defendant, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>, who was executed in 1987, together forced their bound victims to drink caustic drain cleaner. Moreover, he said, a woman was raped and one of the survivors had a pen kicked into his ear. `` Pencils, Drano, rape and murder ... shocking and indefensible crimes,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who opposed capital punishment on principle. `` It was not racism, it was heinous crime.'' <ORGANIZATION> Calvary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> Pastor <PERSON> France </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said racial attitudes in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, where 92.3 percent of the 1.7 million population is white, stem from the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s history of barring black men from the lay priesthood. It was n't until 1978 that then-President <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> opened the clergy to blacks. About 70 percent of Utahns are Mormons. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>' long stay on death row stems from <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s lengthy review policy for capital cases. Besides <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>, the two previous executions occurred after the criminals had abandoned the appeals process.

<HEAD>Official Historian Says Soviets Responsible for Katyn Massacre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government historian reversed the official view of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s most painful wartime memory, and blamed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for the World War II massacre of Polish soliders at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jarema </PERSON> <PERSON> Maciszewski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> Polish-Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> commission </ORGANIZATION> set up to investigate `` blank spots `` in history, said there was `` no doubt'' the Soviets were responsible, the state <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news service reported Monday. It was the first direct statement from the commission on the subject and appeared the culmination of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s yearlong reassessment of the masssacre of 15,000 Polish officers at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> and two other Soviet camps. The official Soviet and Polish version had been that the officers were shot by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in 1941 after <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> invaded the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maciszewski </PERSON> said a communique from the 1944 Soviet Burdenko commission that investigated the slaying is false. He said it was contradicted by other information, including evidence from <LOCATION> Nuremberg </LOCATION> trial investigations and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> representatives. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> had said earlier that circumstantial evidence pointed to Soviet guilt. But <PERSON> Maciszewski </PERSON>'s conclusions published in the Aug. 19 issue of Polityka and reported by <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>, said Soviet responsibility was definite. `` There is no doubt about the Burdenko commission's opinions departing from the truth or about full responsibility of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> secret police for the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> crime and the deaths of the officers at the Starobelsk and Ostashkov camps,'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Macizewski </PERSON> as saying. About 4,000 officers, the cream of Polish society called up from the reserves and interned by the Soviets shortly after the outbreak of the war, were shot in the back of the head and dumped in mass graves in <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>, near the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION>. The fate of the remaining officers, interned at two other Soviet camps, has never been revealed. They also are presumed to have been executed. Historians in the West and most Poles have long believed the men were killed on <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s orders in spring 1940. The <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> massacre is considered the most vivid symbol of Soviet atrocities against <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> during the war. For decades <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> was a taboo subject in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and a permanent monument to the victims was not allowed until 1985. The Polish-Soviet commission has reported tentative findings, but has yet to present a final report. Polish historians have called on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to open its archives to resolve all questions surrounding the crime.

 Officials made a mistake counting votes on a riverboat gambling initiative, it was announced Monday, and the revised results show that only one of three counties voted in favor of authorizing the gambling. Two other counties along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Rivewr were voting Tuesday on the measure, and four other river counties will vote next week. An official canvass showed that election officials in one <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> precinct reversed the `` yes'' and `` no'' votes in last week's referendum to authorize floating casinos When the error was discovered, the new total showed the measure lost in the county by a 91-vote margin, said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Palas </PERSON>, a member of the county board of supervisors. <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> voted in favor of the referendum. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Des </PERSON> <PERSON> Moines </PERSON> counties vote on the measure Tuesday. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s riverboat gambling law allows gambling on excursion boats beginning April 1, 1991, in counties where voters first approve it in a referendum. Last week, voters in <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> approved the referendum by a 2-1 margin. The issue was rejected by voters in <LOCATION> Allamakee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and initially, election officials in <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> said it was approved by a vote of 1,122 to 1,060. But <PERSON> Palas </PERSON> said that those results from the Aug. 15 election reflected a mixup in <LOCATION> Cass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, which first reported gambling was approved 130-54. The canvass determined the actual vote should have been reversed in that precinct, leaving the issue defeated countywide by a vote of 1,046 for floating casinos to 1,137 against. Next week, voters in <LOCATION> Scott </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Muscatine </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> counties will vote on the proposal.

 The nation's only university institute to study gambling has opened here as more local governments legalize what some people still view as a vice. `` Some people still look at gaming as quite a ways down on the morality list,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON>, acting associate director of the institute. `` But the attitude toward gaming is definitely changing as states see this as a legal way to generate revenue.'' Ms. <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON>' said Monday that only three states do not have some form of legalized gambling _ <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. The new Institute for the <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gambling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION>, which plans to offer undergraduate minor degrees, opened July 1 at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada-Reno </ORGANIZATION>. `` The institute is relly intended to be an umbrella organization that will ... further the understanding of gambling's effects on society,'' said <ORGANIZATION> UNR </ORGANIZATION> economics professor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Eadington </PERSON>, an analyst of the gaming industry which provides more than half of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s funds to run state government. The <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> institute will focus not only on economic gaming issues, but also will delve into ethical, moral and legal issues to discover why people gamble and why sometimes they become addicted to risk taking. `` There's so much gaming activity going on now that there needs to be a research center where information from all over the world can be gathered,'' Ms. <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> said. In the education area, the institute plans to start slowly by offering non-degree courses through the <ORGANIZATION> UNR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continuing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> this fall for people involved in the casino industry at middle management positions. Then, existing gaming and gambling-related university courses will be consolidated into the equivalent of an undergraduate minor with a specialization in gambling or casino management. `` Gaming really is big business all over the world now,'' Ms. <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> said. `` Even in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> where charitable gaming is really big.'' Voters in an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> recently approved riverboat gambling and <PERSON> Deadwood </PERSON>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, has approved casino games. In some areas where there has been resistance to legalized gambling, people are approving games of chance with the caveat that the business operators also tell people how to get help if they're addicted to gambling, Ms. <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> said `` There's a new trend in lotteries in which a small percentage of the money is earmarked toward treatment of pathological gambling,'' she said, adding that some lottery machines must have on them phone numbers of gambling addiction treatment centers. `` It's a bit of a twist to get voters to approve gambling.''

 A streak of bad luck has <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lottery </LOCATION> officials moaning that they ca n't give money away. Lottery workers have been frustrated for the past 18 months by the failure of any contestant in the weekly Big Spin game to hit the jackpot. `` Unfortunately, the wheel of fortune has run against the lottery,'' says <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON>, the lottery director. `` We have n't had any big winners, and that's what the lottery needs.'' In addition to making a lucky contestant $ 1 million richer, a jackpot hit might help reverse a slump in ticket sales, which fell 50 percent in the lottery's second year. `` The one thing that drives ticket sales is the publicity that goes to the winners,'' <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> says. The last jackpot winner was <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> of Billings, who won $ 950,000 on Feb. 17, 1988. Since then, 219 contestants have spun the Big Spin wheel without hitting the jackpot. The wheel has 100 slots representing various payouts. Entries for the Big Spin also have slumped. Only about 35,000 people enter the drawing each week now by sending in losing instant-winner tickets, compared to about 120,000 a week during the game's opening months two years ago, lottery spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Duda </PERSON> says. In an effort to spread more wealth, lottery officials altered the wheel last September. They upped the lowest prize from $ 1,000 to $ 3,000, added new $ 50,000 and $ 100,000 slots, and created two jackpot slots that pay $ 1 million each. The old format had one jackpot slot that began at $ 250,000 and increased $ 25,000 each time a contestant failed to hit it. There were four winners under the old system. But even with the increased odds of 50-to-1 for a jackpot winner, none has materialized yet. The extended streak of bad luck for an office whose phone number is 442-LUCK has become a running joke at lottery headquarters. `` We'd love to have some million-dollar hits,'' <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> says. `` That money is sitting there waiting to be won. There's nothing else we can do with it.'' By law, at least 45 percent of lottery revenue must be paid out in prizes. The money sits in a state account, earns no interest for the lottery and can not be spent on anything but prizes. To make sure the wheel is operating properly, lottery officials spin it six times before and six times after the spins by the three weekly contestants. The wheel also must be spun 100 times after it is moved to ensure its random nature. <PERSON> Duda </PERSON> says the jackpot slots have been hit several times during the warm-up spins. In one instance, it came up twice in a row. The lottery's instant-winner ticket sales fell to about $ 12 million in the year ending June 30, down from $ 23 million during the game's first year. Ticket sales of more than $ 1 million in May ended a seven-month decline, and <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> said he hopes sales will hit $ 18 million during the current fiscal year.

 The government is investigating additional top Cuban officials named by a drug trafficker whose revelations led to the execution of four high-ranking members of <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s government. The attorney for smuggler <PERSON> Reinaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> had implicated <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Raul </PERSON>, the defense minister, in cocaine trafficking. The case of <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, sentenced Monday to 17 years in prison, also brought testimony that former Haitian military leader Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> supported drug smugglers, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulvihill </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, 51, indicted on 27 drug counts in February 1988, has cooperated fully with the government since his arrest last year, <PERSON> Mulvihill </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> had faced a life sentence on the charges, but his sentence could be reduced even further if he continues to tesfify, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> must also pay a $ 1.1 million fine. <PERSON> Mulvihill </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> had given the names of `` four or five'' more smuggling groups headed by leading Cuban officials, and said those cases were under investigation. <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, said his client `` told the government that both <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> are involved in drug trafficking,'' but <PERSON> Mulvihill </PERSON> refused to confirm the two <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leaders were targets of the continuing probe. The prosecutor acknowledged, however, that <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>'s information `` has been pretty accurate so far.'' <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> was present at a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> air base with <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s bodgyguards when at one point cocaine spilled out of the cigar boxes <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> used to disguise his cargo, according to the prosecutor and defense attorney The bodyguards spurned the cocaine, but said they would like any marijuana <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> had available, the prosecutor said. In addition, a secretly made videotape of a convicted member of <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>'s gang, <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Carvil </PERSON>, showed him telling drug pilots before his arrest that they had no reason to fear turmoil in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. `` ` It's OK to go in there because <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> is narcotics trafficking too _ all you have to do is pay the price,'' the prosecutor recounted <PERSON> Carvil </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> was ousted from power in September 1988. <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> took the stand briefly, saying he wanted to make up for the damage he had done through his drug smuggling. `` I am willing to testify, cooperate, to go to any kind of extent ... even on my own expense,'' <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> told the judge. <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> pleaded guilty in March to heading a cocaine-smuggling ring that shipped at least 1,000 pounds of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> via </LOCATION> <LOCATION> a </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> air force base and other points. His son, <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, and girlfriend, <PERSON> Ligia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, also pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing. <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, a Cuban exile, had set up a smuggling ring that handled everything from getting Cubans out of their homeland to bringing Puerto Rican lottery tickets to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He eventually made contact with a cousin in the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> military who introduced him to many of the officials who since have been arrested or executed in their country. <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> has acknowledged that revelations from the case, which he said matched information from <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> sources, prompted the investigation that led to the June arrest and execution of four top <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> officials, including the decorated war hero Maj.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar lost ground against the Japanese yen Tuesday in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> while stock prices fell marginally. The dollar closed at 142.78 yen, down 0.57 yen from Monday's close of 143.35 yen After opening at 142.78 yen, it ranged between 142.70 and 142.87 yen during the day.

<TEXT>
 Two counties along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> were voting on riverboat gambling in the second round of referendums on the floating casinos. The issue passed last Tuesday in <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and was defeated in <LOCATION> Allamakee </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> counties. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Des </PERSON> <PERSON> Moines </PERSON> counties vote on the measure today; four more counties will vote next week. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s riverboat gambling law allows gambling on excursion boats beginning April 1, 1991 in counties where voters first approve it in a referendum. Next week, voters in <LOCATION> Scott </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Muscatine </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> counties will vote on the proposal. No one in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s tenth <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Louisa </PERSON>, has asked for a referendum. Along the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Woodbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> supervisors last week set a referendum for Sept. 26 and petitions were being circulated in <LOCATION> Mills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, but a date for a referendum has n't been set. The Legislature this year voted to authorize riverboat gambling, limiting betting to $ 5 per play and setting a $ 200 nightly limit on losses. Boats can offer blackjack, roulette, slot machines, dice games and video gambling. In <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, in northeast <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, officials initially announced that voters had approved last week's referendum. They announced Monday that a review of the vote count showed the measure had lost. An official canvass showed that election officials in one precinct had reversed the `` yes'' and `` no'' votes. When the error was discovered, the new total showed the measure lost in the county by a 91-vote margin, said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Palas </PERSON>, a member of the county board of supervisors.

<HEAD>Harvard Researcher Says Current War on Marijuana a Losing Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration should shift its billion-dollar effort to curtail marijuana use toward education because the current interdiction strategy is n't working, says a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researcher. The funds poured into stemming the flow of marijuana in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could easily be cut in half because `` it's pretty clear there's nothing the federal government can do with its enforcement efforts to reduce the abuse,'' researcher <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> A.R </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kleiman </PERSON> said in an interview Monday. <PERSON> Kleiman </PERSON>, a lecturer at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>, released a new study that urges federal officials to move away from a broad `` war on drugs'' and instead focus on practical solutions to the problem. The annual federal marijuana enforcement budget nearly doubled between 1982 and 1988, growing from $ 526 million in 1988 dollars to $ 968 million. But the funding has curtailed neither availability nor abuse of the drug, <PERSON> Kleiman </PERSON> said. He contends the `` war on drugs'' mentality prevalent in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since the early 1980s is an emotional, rather than practical, appeal that has backfired in several ways. Interdiction efforts on the international level have restricted the flow of drugs into this country, but resulted in encouraging a wider domestic marijuana industry that produces an even more potent form of the drug. `` Some consumers are literally growing it at home and domestic production has gone from possibly 10 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marijuana market to probably a third today by weight,'' the researcher said. <PERSON> Kleiman </PERSON> said he based his domestic production figure on federal drug enforcement reports. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> placed the 1988 figure at about 25 percent. The current marijuana enforcement strategy has also encouraged violence by giving criminal organizations an edge in the trade, <PERSON> Kleiman </PERSON> said. `` The more enforcement there is, the better violence and corruption pay,'' he wrote. `` The natural effect of ordinary drug enforcement is to drive out the weakest drug dealers and increase the profit of the rest.'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cirignano </PERSON>, a spokesman for national drug policy coordinator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, declined to comment on <PERSON> Kleiman </PERSON>'s study, but said a new drug strategy scheduled for unveiling this fall would target `` not just drug dealers but users.'' Instead of pouring funding into enforcement programs, <PERSON> Kleiman </PERSON> said the money should be directed toward educational programs that would make marijuana use less acceptable. `` The best way to reduce adolescent drug abuse is to teach them the skill of gracefully declining the offer of something they do n't want to do,'' he said

<TEXT>
 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> fired the manager of his conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in an apparent bid to bolster the sliding fortunes of the party before the national election. <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Geissler </PERSON> told reporters at a news conference late Monday that <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told him he would not be renominated at the party's national conference, which begins Sept. 10 in <LOCATION> Bremen </LOCATION> `` I regret this,'' said <PERSON> Geissler </PERSON>, who has been party general secretary for 12 years. `` I think it sends the wrong political signal.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> planned a news conference today to discuss party issues as well as the government's plans for responding to a flood of refugees from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Like <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s reorganization of his 19-member Cabinet in April, the party shakeup appears aimed at winning back voters who have been defecting to other parties the past two years. The Christian Democrats fared poorly in the European Parliament elections in June, and it lost control of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> city governments in other elections this year. Although <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s economic performance has continued strong, voters have become increasingly disenchanted with the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government's policies toward sharing of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense burdens and the steady stream of refugees and asylum seekers entering the country. That dissatisfaction has sent many traditional Christian Democrat voters to the political fringes, boosting support for both the ultra-rightist Republicans and leftist parties like the Greens. Public opinion polls conducted over the past few months have repeatedly shown the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> running a few points behind the left-leaning Social Democrats in popularity. The liberal <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, currently aligned to <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s conservative-led coalition, has also hinted recently that it may switch allegiances before the next national elections in December 1990 if the party continues its slide at the polls

<HEAD>Official: Diplomatic Ties with Britain Could be Restored</HEAD>

 A top Iranian official was quoted today as saying <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> could restore diplomatic ties that were severed during the <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> dispute if <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> shows respect for Islamic values, the state news agency reported. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaezi </PERSON>, deputy foreign minister for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, as saying `` relations with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> can be restored even today.'' `` But this must be conditional on the British government being able to convince members of the Majlis -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- that its intentions are genuinely motivated and it will be willing to respect Islamic principles and values,'' he said in an interview with the government-supervised <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The Majlis voted in March to sever ties with <LOCATION> Britian </LOCATION> after the government refused to denounce the British novelist because of his novel `` The Satanic Verses.'' The late <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, claiming <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> had blashphemed <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, sentenced him to death and the Indian-born author went into hiding with British police protection. While recognizing the book might offend some people, the British government said <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> was excercising his right of free speech. Fourteen Western nations withdrew their ambassadors temporarily from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> because of the death sentence. <PERSON> Vaezi </PERSON> said the ups-and-downs in relations with the West are caused by its lack of concern for Islamic values, the foundation of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. He said ties with <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> could have remained strong were it not for the `` unpardonable mistake of supporting <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Vaezi </PERSON> meanwhile linked the case of jailed Briton <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, a longtime resident of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> imprisoned on spying charges, to that of <PERSON> Kourosh </PERSON> <PERSON> Fouladi </PERSON>, an Iranian he said was serving an unjust 10-year sentence in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fouladi </PERSON>, a former doorman at the Iranian Embassy in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, was arrested in 1980 following a bungled car bombing attack in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The only survivor of a gang of three bombers who blew themselves up, <PERSON> Fouladi </PERSON> was jailed for 10 years in 1982. `` <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> is charged with spying during the Iran-Iraq war and only the judiciary of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> can decide on his case based on the charges filed against him,'' <PERSON> Vaezi </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has an obligation to continue humanitarian aid to the Contras until democratic conditions exist in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Monday the aid should continue despite a plan approved by Central American presidents to dismantle the Contras by Dec. 5. `` The bottom line is that they should not be forced to go back to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> until it is safe for them to do so and until conditions have been established for their normal reintegration into Nicaraguan society,'' the vice president said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s comments, in a speech before the annual Veterans of Foreign Wars convention, represented an elaboration of the administrations' position that the Central American presidents' plan was premature. The Contras, backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1981, have been fighting to oust <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government and are now mostly camped along the Honduran border with <PERSON> Nicarague </PERSON>. The vice president said it is `` indisputable that safe and democratic conditions do not exist in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> today, and until they do exist, it will remain a moral obligation of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to continue its humanitarian assistance to those people.'' Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from both parties have said that the Dec. 5 demobilization deadline could set the stage for a confrontation between the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because the humanitarian aid program set up for the Contras is subject to congressional review and could be halted on Nov. 30. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> aligned himself with conservatives who maintain that the Contras should remain intact as a fighting force until after the leftist Sandinista government holds elections on Feb. 25, 1990. `` We believe that maintenance of the resistance as a cohesive force provides a unique incentive to the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to live up to their pledge to allow free elections,'' he said. The plan signed by the presidents of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> does not mention the mechanics for disarming the rebels. It calls for an international commission to aid the Contras in resettling in their homeland or a third country. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has said the rebels must leave their base camps near the Nicaraguan border. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> challenged the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to `` guarantee the integrity'' of the February election by allowing for a non-government television station, permitting voting by exiles and lifting all restrictions on foreign election observers. The vice president, who visited several <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries in June, also called on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to stop arming leftist guerrillas in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was given a polite but restrained reception by the veterans, some of whom had complained about his appearance because of the controversy during last year's campaign over his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> service. The speech was interrupted only twice by applause, though most of the delegates rose to applaud when the speech was over. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> interrupted his vacation and flew to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> from the ranch of Sen. <PERSON> Malcom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pacific Telesis Settlement Raises Hope in Other Phone Strikes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Tensions remained after the settlement of a telephone strike in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, while vandalism and demonstrations mounted in a strike in the Northeast. Elsewhere, there was hope the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION> agreement would give new impetus to resolve strikes in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states. About 42,000 strikers returned to work Monday at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-based </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION> after negotiators reached agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> over the weekend on a pact that will raise salaries by 11 percent over three years. The agreement is scheduled for a ratification vote by Sept. 22. But hard feelings remained among those who went on strike and those who stayed on the job. `` They're not talking to us,'' said one directory assistance operator who had crossed the picket lines because he could n't afford to strike. `` I'm a very mild-mannered person. I just ignore them.'' More vandalism was reported in the strike against <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>, which serves <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the Northeast. A judge in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, issued a temporary injunction ordering strikers not to engage in mass picketing or interfere with operations at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. There were at least 13 incidents of vandalism to <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> lines last weekend, causing phone service outages for more than 4,000 customers, company spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Dooley </PERSON> said he thought the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION> contract could serve as a guide for negotiations between the union and <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION>, which serves five Midwestern states. Both <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> officials said they were willing to go back to the bargaining table, although neither side expressed a willingness to initiate new talks. There also were hopeful signs in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, where negotiations continued between workers and management at <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>, which covers the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>, an adminstrative assistant for the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION>, said union officials `` have still got hope'' of resolving the issues with <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> by midnight Tuesday. Both sides agreed to the deadline. The three continuing strikes involve more than 150,000 workers. In <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, Judge <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> issued a restraining order that instructs the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> to have no more than 10 pickets at an entrance to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telephone </LOCATION> building. In addition, pickets must remain at least 15 feet away from company vehicles and employees and can not vandalize company equipment, he said. But striking union members said they had been advised by their attorneys that <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> had no jurisdiction over the matter and that they could carry on with their picketing as usual. `` Essentially it means nothing,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, president of Local 1126 in <LOCATION> Utica </LOCATION>, N.Y. In <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, a man was arrested for disorderly conduct in a demonstration outside a <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> building as police escorted about 200 management employees to their jobs.

<TEXT>
 Dozens of people threw rocks at police and passing cars after rumors spread that a police dog bit a man while he was being arrested on drug charges. Monday's disturbance took place in a mostly black neighborhood where protests broke out for more than a week earlier this year after the death of a black man in police custody. The latest incident lasted about 45 minutes, and produced no injuries and no arrests, police said. The outcry began after members of the county prosecutor's fugitive unit saw <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 21, on a street. King, who is black, was being sought for failure to appear in court to face charges of cocaine possession, police said. Officers using dogs tracked down King in nearby woods. King resisted and kicked one of the arresting officers, Mayor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Manahan </PERSON> said. The officer's dog nipped King on the buttocks, but did not break the skin, he said. A crowd of about 50 people, many of them teen-agers, confronted the officers as they led King to a patrol car. King yelled to the crowd that the dog had bit him, police said, and some residents also said they had seen a police dog bite him. Police said some in the crowd then began shouting and throwing rocks. Within minutes, the crowd swelled to at least 200 people. `` They were saying things like ` No more <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,''' Patrolman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonergan </PERSON> said. `` I get the feeling a lot of frustration was being vented.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> A. `` Tony'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who was wanted by police on a traffic warrant, collapsed and died in January after officers chased and arrested him in the same neighborhood. His death sparked several days of demonstrations in the town by protesters who alleged policy brutality. There was no violence during those protests. Dr. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> medical examiner, ruled <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> died from heart failure brought on by cocaine use. Thirty officers from five police departments answered a call for help from <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION> police during the rock-throwing, Lt. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Demnitz </PERSON> said. The crowd also threw rocks and bottles at cars on several thoroughfares near a low-income housing project in the neighborhood, officials said. No one was injured in the incident, but one officer from a neighboring police department broke his leg in a car accident as drove to the disturbance, <PERSON> Demnitz </PERSON> said. Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabin </PERSON>, reading from a news release, said King had suffered scratches running through the woods and was taken to <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and given a tetanus shot. <PERSON> Manahan </PERSON> said King at first said he had not been bitten by the dog, then said he had.

<HEAD>FAA Issues Directive To Improve Fire Safety on Certain Aircraft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA SHUCHMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has ordered airlines to tighten fire safety measures on many aircraft after studying the 1987 crash of a <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 that caught fire in the air. In a directive made public on Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said the operational and equipment changes were ordered to avoid `` an uncontrolled cargo fire that could cause systems and structural damage, leading to the loss of the airplane.'' The plane models affected by the Aug. 10 directive include certain <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707s, 727s, 737s, 747s and 757s, and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> DC-8s, DC-9s _ including MD-80s _ and DC-10s. Approximately 40 airplanes currently operated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers are affected, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> also said there are about 278 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes and 124 <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> planes affected worldwide. Only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers are required to follow <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rules, although foreign carriers usually do. The aircraft affected by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> ruling are equipped with Class B cargo compartments, located on the main deck which also carries passengers. The planes are designed so that the same area of the aircraft can be used for passengers, cargo or both, said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. On these planes, crew members are responsible for walking back to the cargo compartment and extinguishing any fires, <ORGANIZATION> KIRO-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> reported. The <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet that crashed into the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> on November 28, 1987, killing 159 people, had a Class B cargo compartment. `` Although no formal findings have been issued by the foreign authority having jurisdiction over the accident investigation, there is firm evidence that an inflight fire occurred in a Class B cargo compartment, which contributed to the loss of the airplane,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> presented two options to improve fire safety aboard the aircraft. The planes can be refitted with Class C cargo compartments which would be located on a different deck from passengers, self-contained and better equipped to handle and control a fire. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> noted that there are no known cases of aircraft lost due to fire in Class C cargo compartments. A second option would require design changes, including installation of smoke or fire detection and fire extinguishing systems, and having aboard an individual `` trained to fight cargo fires,'' the directive said. The agency estimated that retooling to Class C cargo departments could take three years after the ruling goes into effect Sept. 25. The alternative design changes could be accomplished in one year. The cost of converting a Class B cargo compartment to Class C would be approximately $ 2.5 million for each wide body airplane and about $ 1 million for a standard body, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> estimated. The costs of the alternative design changes were estimated at $ 800,000 for each standard body plane and $ 2.2 million for each wide body. The ruling goes into effect Sept. 25.

<HEAD>Solarz Calls for International `Insurance Policy' for Hong Kong</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative today called for an international `` insurance policy'' under which many <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents wary about Chinese rule that begins in 1997 could quickly escape. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Democrat who is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> Affairs, said such a multilateral program involving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and other countries would help restore confidence among <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> people. The 5.7 million people of this British colony have long been concerned about what will happen to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> when it reverts to Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in eight years. Fears over the future increased after the Chinese military quashed the pro-democracy movement in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in June. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said he envisioned a program under which <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> people could move permanently to a foreign country without first meeting existing residency requirements. He said perhaps several hundred thousand local people could meet qualifying criteria set by the host countries for the program. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents who qualify for the program would have `` the confidence to remain here, where I think most of them would like to stay, knowing that if worse came to worse they would have the opportunity to relocate elsewhere,'' <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> told a news conference. He said such a program might `` give the authorities in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> an even greater incentive to conduct themselves ... in a way that is sensitive to the concerns of the people in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, knowing ... that if they botch it all up when they arrive in 1997 a lot of the people who make <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> go would no longer be around.'' <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said he would discuss the issue, which he described as `` a kind of multilateral immigration insurance policy,'' with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration when he returns to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and that he might hold hearings. He said the support of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would be crucial. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> has refused to grant most <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents the right to live in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> but has spoken of an international relief effort if the situation deteriorates in the territory. Tens of thousands of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents have besieged local consulates in bids to emigrate before the Chinese take over. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> also said the manner in which <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> deals with its rapidly expanding population of Vietnamese boat people will help determine the willingness of the international community to assist <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> people. More than 50,000 Vietnamese who fled their Communist homeland by boat for this colony are now languishing in crowded <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> camps. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> continues to offer temporary refuge to all arriving Vietnamese, despite calls by many residents to scrap the policy. The government has started a screening policy, however, under which Vietnamese who can not prove they fled persecution will be forcibly sent back to their homeland once <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> agrees. But <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said, `` It can not be in the interest of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> if people are en masse forced to return'' to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. He suggested boat people who are determined not eligible for refugee status be given several months to volunteer to return home.

<HEAD>370 Detained as Police Break up Anniversary Protests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 370 people, including dozens of foreigners, were taken into custody during protests marking the 21st anniversary of the invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, a newspaper reported today. Authorities blamed foreign media and `` provocateurs'' for Monday's demonstrations for more freedom and the withdrawal of Soviet troops who rolled in to crush Communist reform on Aug. 21, 1968. At least three protests were dispersed by baton-wielding police, and several people were beaten. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Rude Pravo reported that there were no injuries. The daily quoted an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON>, as saying 320 Czechoslovak citizens were detained as well as 50 foreigners. It did not say where they were from. Officials earlier declined to give any specific figures or to elaborate. Czechoslovak activists said late Monday at least four Hungarians were among those arrested. A Polish journalist said he was told by Polish diplomats that `` several'' Poles were also detained. The nation's entrenched leaders, installed by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> after 1968 but now under mounting pressure to introduce reform, blamed what the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> called foreign `` provocateurs'' from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for the protest and said they would be punished under valid Czechoslovak laws. Rude Pravo reiterated those accusations and also accused Western news agencies and other media of inciting protest by reporting plans for mass demonstrations before they happened. The busloads of riot police sent in to quell the protests were seen leaving the capital today. The demonstrations marked the invasion led by the Soviets and joined by all <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations except <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, which ended the `` Prague Spring'' reforms begun by former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>. In the protests, at least 4,000 people marched round the city for hours chanting calls for freedom and the withdrawal of Soviet troops and shouting to police `` Let our brothers go!'' each time arrests were made by hundreds of helmeted riot police. The show of force contrasted with reforms under way in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which have encouraged many Czechoslovaks to demand similar changes. Hungarian government television on Monday broadcast interviews with former leaders who introduced the reforms of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring, interspersed with footage of burning tanks and of other emotional memories of the invasion. Other clips during the 30-minute broadcast showed clashes between Czechoslovak riot police and protesters. In a previously unshown interview, former Deputy Premier <PERSON> Ota </PERSON> <PERSON> Sik </PERSON>, who fled to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> after the invasion, said the present Czechoslovak leadership is `` dancing on a thin rope. ... it is really hoping that -LRB- Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is going to fall and that it can survive that long.'' The Hungarian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government each strongly disassociated themselves last week from the 1968 invasion, with Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> saying Sunday that his government condemns <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s participation in the invasion. The Polish <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> stung Czechoslovak leaders with a strongly worded resolution last week condemning the invasion as a violation of international law. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the traditional role model for <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s Communists, was more cautious <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremitskykh </PERSON> made clear Monday, however, that the 1968 invasion could be seen only in the context of the times. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which has also resisted reforms, was the only one of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies to come out with a clear statement supporting the invasion as a necessary move to thwart counterrevolution in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>.

 Troops today fatally shot a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> woman in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and residents in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> refugee camp found the body of a youth shot in the chest, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. A 14-year-old Palestinian girl also died today of wounds suffered in a clash with soldiers last week, hospital officials said. Her funeral in the <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Askar </ORGANIZATION> refugee camp reportedly sparked a clash with troops after youths covered her body with the outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag and threw stones at soldiers. The army said it was checking the three reported deaths. A senior army officer was sent to investigate reports that a youth was found dead from a chest wound at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Al-Amari </ORGANIZATION> refugee camp, near <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. It was the second mysterious killing in the area north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in a week. On Friday, a shepherd found the body of a Palestinian-American boy who had been shot in the chest at close range in <LOCATION> El-Bireh </LOCATION>, adjacent to <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, doctors at <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Maha </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadaf </PERSON>, 20, died after she was shot in the head with a rubber-coated metal ball of the type used by the army to disperse riots. Arab witnesses in <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Balah </PERSON> refugee camp in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> said Ms. <PERSON> Hadaf </PERSON> was hit by a stray shot. They said she was shopping in the camp market when a clash erupted nearby between stone-throwing youths and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. Meanwhile, doctors at <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> hospital said <PERSON> Najla </PERSON> <PERSON> Aadel </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Nadi </PERSON>, 14, died of a bullet wound to the head after being shot by soldiers during a protest in the Askar refugee camp near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> a week ago. At least 545 Palestinians have been killed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> troops or Jewish settlers in the 20-month uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied territories. Thirty-eight Israelis have also been killed. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, residents in the <PERSON> Al-Amari </PERSON> camp told <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters they found the body of <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahin </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Katrina </PERSON>, 17, with bullet wound to his upper torso. An army spokeswoman said the army viewed the reports as `` very serious'' and sent a senior officer to investigate. The residents said troops opened fire during clashes in the camp Monday night. The army spokesman, who is not identified by name under military regulations, said he could not confirm any clashes occurred. Soldiers put the camp under curfew this morning, ordering residents into their homes and barring outsiders from entering. After a similar death last week, the army exhumed the body of a 14-year-old Palestinian-American, <PERSON> Amjad </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON>, whose family said they believed the boy was in army custody before he was found dead of a gunshot wound. After an investigation and autopsy the army said it determined that <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON> had not been shot by security forces, based on movements of troops in the <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> area. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> daily today quoted an informed security source as saying the army's findings `` did not rule out a killing during security forces operations, they do not exclude independent action by an individual soldier, security operative, settler or Arab assailant.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> asked <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to investigate the death of the youth, who was born in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, and lived for a time in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He returned to his family's hometown of <LOCATION> El-Bireh </LOCATION> in 1983. <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities agreed to turn over results of the autopsy to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and to allow the family to have an independent pathologist examine the corpse.

 <LOCATION> OPA-LOCKA </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commandant </ORGANIZATION> Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> has agreed to support a proposed ten-mile tanker-free zone off <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s coast, but the plan quickly drew criticism from the oil industry. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> won <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>'s backing for his plan to shift major shipping lanes to 10 nautical miles from the coastal reefs after the two officials flew down the coast to the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> on Monday. `` All we can do to prevent a catastrophe in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> needs to be done,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. `` Establishing a tanker-free zone would create a buffer between <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s coast and tanker traffic, which would provide additional response time to deal with any oil spills.'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> would seek federal and international backing for the plan, and agreed to study <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> participation in a major oil-spill drill with <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> authorities within the next 12 months. But <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, transportation director for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said the plan has `` significant problems that need to be worked out'' and would require lengthy international negotiations. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> also said the proposal could make shipping more dangerous by forcing southbound tankers into the lane normally used by northbound tankers. Shipping lanes currently pass as close as two miles from shore at some points along <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s coast, though both <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> noted that most fully laden tankers heading north normally take advantage of strong Gulf Stream currents farther out to sea. More than 5,000 ships pass in and out of the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> through the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Straits </LOCATION> each year, carrying `` tens of billions'' of gallons of petroleum products, the governor's office said. Vessels entering <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> ports carry an estimated 12 billion gallons of petroleum products each year. Most of it goes to <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> _ the nation's second largest port for oil-tanker traffic. While the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and many other nations support a 12-mile international limit, <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said international support for the proposed change would require lobbying at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees shipping worldwide. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> cautioned that it could take years to get other nations to agree to the move and to overcome expected opposition from the shipping industry. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> agreed. `` This is not something that can be changed overnight,'' the governor said. `` Ships will have to slow their speed, travel farther and use more fuel. So we expect that will figure in the industry view.'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said he found the proposal especially important since the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> hit a reef in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and spilled about 11 million gallons of crude into the pristine waters of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> in March.

 <PERSON> Kandu </PERSON>, the giant killer whale that gave birth before thousands of people last fall, was killed when she collided with another killer whale during a performance at Sea World, park officials said. <PERSON> Kandu </PERSON>, who weighed about 6,000 pounds, and <PERSON> Corky </PERSON>, who weighs about 8,000 pounds, were starting their 4 p.m. show in the performing tank at Shamu Stadium when the accident occurred, <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION> officials said. The show was canceled and several thousand visitors who witnessed the bloody accident were escorted out of the stadium. Park officials said it's uncertain when the popular whale shows would resume. `` It's very obvious to you, as it is to us, that -LRB- <LOCATION> Kandu </LOCATION> -RRB- is bleeding,'' the announcer at Shamu Stadium told the audience. `` We're not really sure what happened ... We want to see if we can get the whales calmed down.'' Park veterinarians and animal-care staff were preparing to perform an autopsy on <PERSON> Kandu </PERSON>, who gave birth to <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamu </PERSON> in the same stadium last September. <PERSON> Corky </PERSON>, who apparently was not injured, completed part of a shortened performance before the audience was led away, witnesses said. `` The two adult whales were coming into the show pen when it seemed like they collided,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, who was at the show while on vacation from <LOCATION> Stansbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. `` They got the mother whale into about six inches of water _ the baby was laying right there next to her _ and the blood was really bad,'' he said. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> told KFMB-TV he saw the accident from a high seat in the back of the stadium. `` The two large whales apparently collided at a high rate of speed, about 35 to 40 mph,'' he said. `` I did see a tail section come out of the water and the whales did a complete circle, then when the mother came out she spewed a large amount of blood from her blowhole,'' he said. <PERSON> Corky </PERSON> is about 25 years old and 20 feet long. <PERSON> Kandu </PERSON> was about 14 years old and measured 17 -LCB- feet, said a <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, who asked that her name not be used.

 <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Merced </PERSON> takes his message about AIDS to park benches, gay bars, soup kitchens and crack houses. He goes door to door in mostly Hispanic neighborhoods handing out fliers about where to go for information and testing for <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sida </LOCATION> _ AIDS in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION>. As the AIDS virus seeps into the nation's smaller cities, there is a growing need for people to take AIDS education to those who need it most: intravenous drug users, minorities, the homeless, the poor. `` Those people are the ones who are missed through the more traditional modes of health education,'' says <PERSON> Imani </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, a health education specialist for the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Altanta </LOCATION>. `` It makes sense that people in smaller communities are trying to figure out methods to deal with this because this problem is everywhere.'' The tests here are conducted at the <ORGANIZATION> Heartside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, which began the AIDS program in May with state funding. The clinic is located in a tiny storefront in the heart of the city's `` skid row,'' which attracts a large percentage of the city's transient population, drug and substance abusers and prostitutes Of those coming to the clinic, about 80 percent are considered at high risk of contracting AIDS. Of about 80 tests conducted since May, 14 people have tested positive. Outside God's Kitchen, the city's biggest soup kitchen, Merced greets many of the dozens of men and women who form a line halfway down the block for a free meal. `` I try to be a friend first and get their trust,'' says the 29-year-old Merced. `` They know me as the AIDS man. And that's OK.'' Merced, a native of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, has been successful in getting indigent members of the city's Hispanic community into the clinic for free testing `` We've been flooded since we got someone who can break the language barrier,'' says project director <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. `` That's not easy to find in this part of the country.'' For those who test positive for the HIV virus, counselors construct a `` life plan,'' arranging for medical care, housing and food. `` This is such a disenfranchised group of people, you ca n't tell them that they'll have to go to one place to fill out a form, go to another halfway across town to get their medical care and another to get food. ... The next time you'll see them, they'll be in the emergency room,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> says.

Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer.

<HEAD>Dingo-Baby Couple Still Fighting for Compensation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>, the mother in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s dingo-baby case, says she is owed millions of dollars in compensation promised nearly a year after she was found innocent of charges she killed her infant daughter. Mrs. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>, who claims her 6-week-old daughter was snatched by a dingo, a native Australian wild dog, while on a camping trip in the <LOCATION> Outback </LOCATION>, says the notoriety has left her broke and prevented her family from living a normal life. Mrs. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>, 41, who in the past has resented her trial by media, called a news conference with selected journalists Monday to generate publicity to force the Northern Territory government, which prosecuted her and later pardoned her, to pay compensation for the 3 -LCB- years she spent in jail. Her ordeal, regarded as one of the miscarriages of justice in Australian legal history, and her fight for compensation have been front-page stories for years in Australian newspapers. But despite eight best-sellers about the case, Mrs. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> claimed she had not received much money. She also said money she received from the 1988 movie `` A Cry In The Dark,'' in which Meryl Streep played her role, covered little more than her expenses. Husband <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, 45, a former pastor with the Seventh Day <ORGANIZATION> Adventist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said he eked out a living chopping firewood and selling it for $ 26 a trailer load. Mrs. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> said she could not afford to buy new shoes for her three school-age children. `` People think a couple so famous should be rich,'' she said. `` Our anonymity has been blasted; we ca n't live a normal life. You ca n't plan for the future because you do n't know what that future is.'' The family's saga has captivated the Australian public since 1980, when Mrs. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> claimed a dingo killed her daughter <PERSON> Azaria </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Outback </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> was prosecuted for murder by the Northern Territory government but was released following the discovery of vital new evidence while a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the highest form of investigation available, reviewed the case. Mrs. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> was finally pardoned last November. The <ORGANIZATION> Chamberlains </ORGANIZATION> have refused to reveal the amount of compensation they were promised, but a figure leaked to the media by the Northern Territory government put it at around $ 3 million. Officials for the Northern Territory government could not be reached for comment today or Monday. `` Maybe an apology is a little hard to swallow and let's face it, compensation is an apology,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> said. The couple said they owe about $ 1 million in legal costs, mostly to the Seventh Day Adventist Church, which supported them through their court battles.

 A West German and a relative of the former king of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> have been charged with plotting to ship a computer to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in violation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export restrictions. <PERSON> Egbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Parthesuis </PERSON>, 46, and <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>, 40, were ordered held without bail following their arrest Monday. <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> was identified in court papers as a nephew of <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, deposed as king of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in a 1973 coup. The pair were scheduled to appear before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitver </PERSON> for a bail hearing Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said its undercover agents set up an export company as part of an eight-month investigation to crack a ring allegedly intending to ship sophisticated military data-processing equipment to Soviet bloc nations. Parthesuis, <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hady </PERSON> <PERSON> Azimi </PERSON>, believed to be <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>'s cousin living in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, conspired to purchase and export a <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> VAX 8820 computer, customs spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON> said. Government regulations bar the export of that type of computer to Soviet-bloc nations, officials said. Agents allowed <PERSON> Parthesuis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> to buy a relatively unsophisticated <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> computer with military applications and export it to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, Customs agent <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> said. At the time of that $ 28,000 purchase, the two allegedly put down a deposit on the VAX 882, he said. `` Then last Thursday they came forward with the balance of the $ 596,000,'' <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Parthesuis </PERSON> allegedly also gave agents a list of other computers, antennas and related equipment he intended to buy, officials said. The equipment was to be flown to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, then trucked to <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, for a flight to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, they added. Customs officials are working with West German police in an attempt to arrest <PERSON> Azimi </PERSON>, officials said. <PERSON> Parthesuis </PERSON> was in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on a visitor's visa, and <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> was a resident alien living in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, officials said. Parthesuis and <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> were charged in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> with violating the 4-year-old Arms Export Control Act as well as with conspiracy and money laundering. If convicted on all counts, they could each receive up to 35 years in prison and a $ 2.5 million fine, officials said.

 The bodies of 18 young Sinhalese men were found in a village northeast of the capital at the spot where Sinhalese radicals ambushed an army convoy, sources said today. Also today, military officials said Sinhalese radicals killed at least 20 relatives of police and army officers, and Indian officials said their forces killed five Tamil rebels. The 18 bodies, all with gunshot wounds, were found in a roadside crater at <LOCATION> Mahawehera </LOCATION>, 85 miles from <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, according to the sources who spoke on condition they were not identified further. The crater was formed when Sinhalese radicals detonated explosives under a passing Sri Lankan army patrol Sunday, killing at least five soldiers and a civilian driver. The sources said the 18 were suspected radicals who were killed in revenge for Sunday's attack. Government officials denied knowledge of any retaliatory violence in <LOCATION> Mahawehera </LOCATION>. However, in the past, senior government officials said privately that members of the security forces have committed `` excesses'' in efforts to halt the radicals' campaign of assassination and terror. Sinhalese radicals oppose the Sinhalese-dominated government's agreement to grant limited autonomy to Tamils in the north and east Most Tamils are Hindu and say they are discriminated against by the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> majority. The killings today and Monday of 20 family members of officers came after radicals threatened to kill the relatives of officers who refused to resign by last Sunday, said military officials, who can not be identified under briefing rules. In <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, radicals hurled a bomb into a police jeep in the northern suburb of <LOCATION> Maradana </LOCATION>, they said. Six policemen were injured. At least 4,000 people have been killed since ultranationalist Sinhalese launched an anti-government campaign in July 1987, when the government agreed to a peace plan with the Tamils. The radicals say a peace plan aimed at ending the rebellion gave too many concessions to the Tamils. They also say the deployment of Indian soldiers in the Tamil-dominated north and east to enforce the plan compromises <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s sovereignity. A statement from the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> or embassy said its soldiers Monday killed five Tamil rebels belonging to a group that rejected the 1987 plan. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sponsored the plan because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils for their Sri Lankan brethren but got bogged down in fighting rebels who renounced it. At least 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have been killed since Tamils launched their separatist war in 1983, complaining of discrimination by the Sinhalese majority. Tamils form 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and Sinhalese make up 75 percent.

<HEAD>Syrian-Christian Clashes Follow Aoun's Peace Offer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Clashes raged overnight between Syrian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the central mountains and north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> despite a peace offer by <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, police said today. Three people were killed and 47 were wounded in the dusk-to-dawn clashes with howitzers, multi-barreled rocket launchers, mortars, tank cannons and machine guns, the police said. By police count, 788 people have been killed and 2,187 wounded since March 8, when the current round of violence broke out pitting <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 mainly Christian troops against 40,000 Syrian soldiers and allied local forces. The `` Operations Room'' of Syrian-backed leftist factions said in a statement that its gunners opened fire on six ships in Lebanese territorial waters and prevented them from docking at Christian ports. The command claimed its gunners `` scored direct hits on the lead ship, forcing the whole group to sail away.'' A spokesman for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the claims as `` baseless.'' The Christian enclave northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> has been under siege by Syrian and allied forces for more than five months with the declared objective of preventing <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> from receiving Iraqi-supplied war material by sea. The <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> spokesman also said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> had provided its leftist and Moslem allies with 130mm Soviet-designed howitzer guns, capable of hitting targets within a 15-mile range. But <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s allies `` do not have the computerized radar equipment needed to detect mobile maritime targets, determine their speed and calculate the target data,'' the spokesman said. Moslem security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Syrians also were sending additional tanks, howitzers and mortars to the 22,000-strong Moslem army units of Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON> as well as Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> militia. One source said the Syrians `` have been flooding their allies with weapons and ammunition for more than a week now. It seems they are preparing them for a major battle with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, told reporters after a 45-minute meeting with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> that, `` There's obviously no military solution to the problem for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said the purpose of his meeting with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> was to `` emphasize that the military confrontation is not taking us anywhere.'' He also said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> favors a cease-fire. Also today, acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem who heads the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> vying for power with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s, refuted the Maronite general's offer Monday for negotiations. `` It is a minefield. Any response to it is highly unlikely,'' <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said in a statement broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> did not comment on the offer and <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> described it as `` a trick to allow <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> a breathing spell to re-arm and marshall his forces.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> had declared a `` war of liberation'' against the Syrian troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, charging the <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> government has betrayed its 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab league by supporting Moslems against Christians in the 14-year-old civil war. Two civilians were wounded by Israeli shelling of villages in southeastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, known to be strongholds for pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists, police reported today. They said at least 10 houses were damaged in overnight bombardment that hit the villages of <LOCATION> Yohmor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sohmor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zillaya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kilia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> el-Tineh and <PERSON> Maydoun </PERSON> outside the zone Israeli troops and allied militiamen control in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> meanwhile <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> sources said a anti-submarine frigate and an oil supply ship are joining six other French naval ships off the Lebanese coast. The Meuse left the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Toulon </LOCATION> early today, maritime sources there said. The <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Vienne </PERSON> left <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> over the weekend, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. French officials have denied Lebanese Moslem allegations that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> may intervene militarily and have said the flotilla could be used to evacuate some 7,000 French passport holders from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> if the fighting worsens.

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> won a victory in court but were less successful in the field, where they mounted a demonstration against a coal company that no longer exists. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlothlin </PERSON>, who has fined the union $ 7.5 million for violating strike restrictions, on Monday dismissed contempt charges against <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and other union leaders who took part in an outlawed sit-down demonstration against the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` This is your victory today,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> told cheering union members after the three-hour trial. `` You can feel you are balancing the scales of justice. If the system treats us fairly we're going to beat <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>.'' The UMW has been on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> since April in a dispute over wages and benefits. The strike affects 1,900 <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> miners in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. About 46,000 fellow union members stayed off the job for about a month in wildcat sympathy strikes. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and five other members of the union's international policy-making board, along with 13 rank-and-file members, were arrested July 25 for sitting in a road to block the entrance to <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s main coal preparation plant in <LOCATION> Russell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McGlothlin </PERSON> tossed out the contempt charges against the union officials after ruling that the prosecuting attorney failed to show that the union leaders were aware of a provision in his injunction that prohibited people from blocking coal truck traffic. Special prosecutor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Detrick </PERSON> argued that the ban on sit-down demonstrations, which has led to more than 2,000 arrests in the past four months, was common knowledge. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, a few dozen <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> workers, joined by about a dozen members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, staged a demonstration outside the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Chafin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, but found the company no longer existed After finding an empty building where the coal company's headquarters were once located, they went to the only building in town named after a <LOCATION> Chafin </LOCATION>, but found the Chafins were no longer affiliated with it They settled for a downtown bank where <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafin </PERSON>, the company's former president, is on the board of directors Then it rained, forcing the group to disband. The mine workers, wearing camouflage, said the coal company disbanded and subleased its <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> mines as a way to get around using union labor. `` They've opened some new mines at the hollow but they have n't called the laid-off fellows back to work,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, a roof bolter furloughed two years ago There was no indication that <PERSON> Chafin </PERSON> was at the bank, or even in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>. Calls to his home telephone went unanswered; a telephone at the home of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a company vice president, had been disconnected.

The new requirement, which opposition leaders attacked, will allow <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> to exert more control over an exodus that has brought 300,000 Bulgarian Turks into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> the past three months, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> has been having trouble providing jobs and housing for the immigrants. Many are temporarily housed in school buildings closed for the summer. The semi-official <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, reporting from the <LOCATION> Edirne </LOCATION> border province, quoted Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., as saying he had seen 10,000 ethnic Turks lined up in cars waiting to get into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> An official at the Kapikule border post on the Turkish-Bulgarian border said he was told the visa requirement goes into effect today. <PERSON> Erdal </PERSON> <PERSON> Inonu </PERSON>, leader of the main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Populist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the foreign policy of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> had been discredited by what he called a policy reversal. But a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement said the government decision was prompted by <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s refusal to start talks toward an immigration agreement protecting the rights of ethnic Turks coming to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. The immigrants say they are fleeing a harsh assimilation campaign that has forced them to change their Moslem names to Slavic ones. They say they have also been fined and beaten for speaking Turkish in public and for practicing Islamic rites. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> is still determined to accept all <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s ethnic Turks who want to come, but within the framework of an immigration agreement keeping families united and allowing compensation for property left behind and for accumulated social security. There are an estimated 1.5 million ethnic Turks in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, and about 3,000 to 5,000 ethnic Turks have been streaming daily into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Leaders of the immigrant community in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> expect the influx to increase after the harvest season in September. They said the total could go as high as 900,000 if <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> continues open-door policies.

<HEAD>University Suspends Provision of its Anti-Discriminatory Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> said it would have suspended part of its policy on racial harassment even if a a civil rights group had not charged the policy violates constitutional free speech rights. `` While we believe that the entire harassment policy can withstand legal scrutiny, we also knew from the beginning that the policy would be refined and improved as we gained experience from its implementation,'' <PERSON> Elsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kircher </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, the university's general counsel, said Monday. The policy, which applies to all students enrolled at the <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON> school, prohibits harassment or discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, creed, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, handicap or Vietnam-veteran status. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> filed a federal lawsuit in May, saying the policy violated constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech. The case is pending. The suspended provision prohibits behavior in academic settings that creates an intimidating, hostile or demeaning environment for educational pursuits, employment or participation in University sponsored extracurricular activities. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> will continue to enforce its anti-harassment policy against behavior that victimizes an individual, the university said in a written statement. `` The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> suit has probably focused our attention on certain aspects of the policy which would have been discussed during the continuing review process this fall, but I have no doubt the review would have led to the same outcome,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. The policy on discrimination was adopted in April 1988 following a series of racial incidents on campus. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> said in its suit that the policy was intended `` to create a chilling effect on the expression of certain ideas because of the content of those ideas,'' and is too broad and vague.

<HEAD>No Fanfare in China on Deng's 85th Birthday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government held no public celebration today on the 85th birthday of senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, but major newspapers carried one of his speeches rejecting mass democracy for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The papers devoted a half-page to the full text of his 1957 speech that said <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members must be supervised by the party, the masses and non-Communist parties if they are to do their jobs well. `` If we refuse to accept supervision or ignore promoting democracy within the party and the nation, we will inevitably be divorced from the masses and make big mistakes,'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said in the speech. However, he went on to say that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> must not implement `` big democracy,'' which the papers referred to the `` large-scale clash of public opinions and unrest'' that is found in Western-style democracies. A footnote to the speech said the term was first used by revolutionary leader <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> in 1956. `` We can do without such democracy only if we have small democracy,'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said, meaning the masses should have channels for expressing their opinions to the party. Party organization officials are in the middle of a major meeting to discuss strengthening the 47 million-member party, including better policing members who express opinions contrary to the party line. Today's papers quoted Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> as saying the meeting `` will play an important role in eliminating the erroneous effects of Comrade <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> on party building.'' <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was ousted as party chief in June after a top-level power struggle over how to handle the spring student democracy movement. The new party chief, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, was quoted as saying that `` the masses of the party workers had long expressed dissatisfaction with <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> for his mistakes in trying to weaken the leadership of the party.'' <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> has become <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s national scapegoat since his purge, and nearly all of the nation's problems have been blamed on him. The papers did not mention <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s birthday, and many people seemed unaware of the date. By contrast, even 13 years after his death the nation still notes the birthday of Chairman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> on Dec. 26 with special essays in the newspapers. `` Is today <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s birthday?'' said a cab driver. `` We're all waiting for him to die. He does n't have much longer.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, whose health has declined gradually in recent years, is now reported to be seriously ill with cancer. He has not been seen in public since June 9, when he spoke to martial law troops in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The most recent photo of him, printed in newspapers Monday, was taken more than seven weeks ago. No sign of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s birthday was seen anywhere in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, even along the main thoroughfare, <LOCATION> Changan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, which is always colorfully decorated with flags and banners on special occasions. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s birthday was not celebrated in past years, but since the June 3-4 military crackdown there have been hints of a possible emerging personality cult. The press has quoted him regularly and released several past essays by him, a new volume of his collected writings has been issued, a book of reminiscences about his early career has come out and a major movie has been made about his role in leading a Communist uprising in 1929. The <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Art Gallery now displays a bronze bust of him.

<HEAD>Defense Rests After Testimony About Tax Overpayment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Lawyers for self-described hotel queen <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> ended their defense after calling an accountant who told the jury in the tax evasion case that the defendant and her husband overpaid $ 581,000 in taxes in 1983-85. The accountant, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Padwe </PERSON>, testified Monday that the federal overpayment stemmed from underreporting the depreciation of property in Helmsley-controlled partnerships. <PERSON> Padwe </PERSON> was the last of four witnesses called by attorneys for Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, who is accused of evading $ 1.2 million in federal taxes in 1983-85 by charging personal expenses to businesses. Lawyers for Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s two co-defendants, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Licari </PERSON>, also rested Monday but without calling any witnesses. <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Licari </PERSON>, who were former top aides in the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> organization, are charged with assisting Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> in the tax evasion scheme. <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> are also charged with conspiring to extort payoffs and merchandise from vendors doing business with <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> companies. The prosecution closed its case last Tuesday after six weeks of testimony. Lawyers will present closing arguments Wednesday. On cross-examination by Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON>, <PERSON> Padwe </PERSON> acknowledged that his review was selective and that the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> could have underpaid taxes in the following years. <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> also implied that the calculation method was part of a strategy to reduce the amount of taxes paid in the long run. <PERSON> Padwe </PERSON> acknowledged that there could be a tax advantage to spreading out the depreciation and said it would be `` clearly improper.'' He said, however, that he did not know if the calculations were deliberate or by mistake. <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> had opposed the defense lawyers' request to call <PERSON> Padwe </PERSON> to the stand. The prosecutor said the evidence was irrelevant and could confuse the jury.

<HEAD>Orders for Big-Ticket Goods Decline for Fourth Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Orders for `` big ticket'' durable goods fell 1.9 percent in July, the fourth decline this year, the government said today in a report that showed manufacturing continuing to struggle despite recent interest rate declines. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said demand for durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, totaled a seasonally adjusted $ 122.9 billion last month, the lowest level since October 1988. Durable goods, one of the most interest rate-sensitive sectors of the economy because consumers often borrow to buy them, also had declined in January, February and May. The latest drop came despite moves by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> since early June to nudge interest rates lower. Earlier, the central bank had been raising rates to dampen economic vigor and inflationary pressure. However, last month's bad news was somewhat offset by a sharply revised increase of 1.4 percent in durable-goods orders in June, previously reported at up only 0.4 percent. Excluding the defense category, which swings widely from month to month, orders fell 0.9 percent in July after an 0.3 percent gain a month earlier. Military orders plunged 14.7 percent to $ 7.6 billion in July following a 17.4 percent rise in June. The other major decline came in non-electrical machinery, which plummeted 9.7 percent last month to $ 21.1 billion, following a 4.8 percent rise in June. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attributed half the decline to a drop in orders for engines and turbines. In a sign of strength, however, the closely watched non-defense capital goods sector rose 5.0 percent to $ 41.1 billion following a 5.1 percent gain in June. Economists use this category as a barometer of business investment plans. The department offered these other details of July activity: _ Electrical machinery, up 1.3 percent to $ 19.8 billion, following a June gain of 4.8 percent _ Primary metals, including steel, up 0.8 percent to $ 11.9 billion, following a 5.1 percent drop _ Transportation equipment, up 2.3 percent to $ 34.2 billion after a 0.1 percent drop A large increase in aircraft orders offset declines in motor vehicles, shipbuilding and tanks. Shipments of durable goods fell 3.0 percent to $ 118.1 billion in July, following drops of 1.0 percent in June and 0.3 percent in May.

 The bodies of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and eight other Americans who died in a plane crash in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> two weeks ago were on their way home today after a memorial service at the airport. The coffins of the nine Americans, draped in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags, were loaded onto a C-141 after a two-hour ceremony. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military cargo plane left <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s international airport shortly after noon and was scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Wednesday afternoon after stopping overnight in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the other Americans and seven Ethiopians died Aug. 7 on their way to a refugee camp along <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s southwestern border when their twin-engine plane slammed into a mountainside. All 16 on board are believed to have died instantly. The bodies were found a week later after a massive search effort by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> officials. Retrieval of the bodies took several days and identification of the remains took nearly a week. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it was planning a memorial service for the government officials that died in the crash. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s family is planning a private service in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will hold its service Wednesday at the Lincoln Memorial. During the airport service here, <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> was eulogized by American, <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials as a man of compassion. `` The fact that he met his tragic death while on a humanitarian mission is ample testimony of his dedication to the well-being of people,'' said <PERSON> Tesfaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolde-Selassie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s minister of internal affairs. The coffins containing the 16 victims were accompanied by an honor guard. A band played solemn music as they were transported from a makeshift clinic, where their remains were identified, to the tarmac. Work at the aiport stopped and airport employees joined senior <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> officials, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy staff and their families, and relatives of the Ethiopian victims at the ceremony. The air was filled with the sound of Ethiopians wailing in grief and sympathy. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger, was heading to the Fugnido refugee camp when the crash occurred. The camp is one of four that house more than 300,000 Sudanese fleeing war and famine in that neighboring country. It was the 44-year-old congressman's fifth visit to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and his second this year. The other Americans who died in the crash were: _ <PERSON> Patrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 35, a Leland aide _ <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 34, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger _ <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillem </PERSON>, 33, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> lawyer and <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> friend who was investigating prospects for food-relief projects he had proposed for <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Francine </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 39, an aide to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., and an expert on child health and nutrition _ <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, age unavailable, a political and economic officer with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, 43, special projects officer for AID in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Worrick </PERSON>, 48, the deputy AID representative in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Worrick </PERSON>, 48, wife of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Worrick </PERSON> and a contract employee of the AID mission in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>

<HEAD>Arkansas City Revises Stockade Ordinance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DERMOTT, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parents of delinquents no longer face a stockade, but those who do n't keep their kids in line can still draw hefty fines and jail time. The city council revised its 2-week-old ordinance Monday, leaving a provision that said parents of wayward youngsters could face up to 30 days in jail, but deleting the part that said two of those days could be spent on public display in a stockade. The law did n't define a stockade, the city does n't have one and the council did n't vote the money to build one when it passed the law initially. A provision in the earlier ordinance to publish photographs of parents of delinquents also was dropped, as was a requirement that such parents place bumper stickers on their cars identifying themselves as irresponsible. It was time to revise the ordinance because it had done its job of calling attention to the problem of juvenile crime in this city of 4,500 with a seven-member police force, said City Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. But, he said, a tough ordinance was needed because, `` We're going to have a dangerous situation here. We're going to pull some kid in some night and he'll be dead.'' The old ordinance was passed following a street fight that drew a crowd of 250 people and because of an overall increase in crime during the summer that Police Chief <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> said could be attributed mostly to juveniles. Like the old ordinance, the revised version says parents will receive a warning the first time their children are caught violating an 11 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. curfew. The second time, parents will face up to 30 days in jail and up to a $ 500 fine or 20 hours of community service. Under the new ordinance, parents may not permit their children to possess drugs or permit their children to have firearms without parental supervision. Some people at Monday's meeting strongly objected to a provision saying parents can not leave children under 12 unsupervised for more than an hour. But <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> insisted that it would take only an hour to produce a potentially deadly situation. Parents also objected to a part of the ordinance that prohibits gatherings of two or more minors `` with riotous conduct.''

 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> is under fire for saying that investigators may subpoena telephone records of reporters who have been leaked government information. `` While we feel strongly about leaks, forcing reporters to disclose their sources is anathema to the First Amendment,'' Reps. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said Monday in a letter to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> `` We are opposed to forcing reporters to disclose their sources, through compulsory process or subpoenas for reporters' telephone records.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s contention on Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' that <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> actions indicate such a search would be permitted under the First Amendment also drew criticism from <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirtley </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Reporters </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am repeatedly appalled that the attorney general seems to feel justified in ignoring guidelines that have served both the interests of the news media and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> very well for 10 years,'' <PERSON> Kirtley </PERSON> said. `` I think it shows a total lack of appreciation of the First Amendment interests that were recognized by his predecessors,'' she said. <PERSON> Kirtley </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> declined to hear a 1978 case that addressed the issue, <ORGANIZATION> Reporters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> vs. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been investigating a news leak this spring that led to a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> report on an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation involving Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa. Various department officials have been questioned by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and at least one has appeared before a grand jury. As stories about <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> abounded in the midst of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> party leadership election, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> took the unusual step of announcing that he was not the subject of an investigation. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> was elected <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic whip. A source said Monday that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was considering subpoenaing the telephone records of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Braver </PERSON>, who first reported the story. The network learned about the possible subpoena and contacted the department, the source said. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, a New York-based spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, said the records had not been subpoenaed. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eramian </PERSON> declined to comment. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, chairman of the subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights, and <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, who chairs the subcommittee on criminal justice, also denounced the department's plan to prosecute government officials for leaking information. `` You are invoking the statute on theft of government property which really has nothing to do with leaks,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> wrote. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not adopted a criminal statute for leaks, and certainly never intended the theft of property law to be used in this way.'' The revision of the department's 11-year-old policy, intended to protect whistleblowers and reporters from prosecution, was announced Aug. 2 in testimony submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said Aug. 3 that he would n't prosecute reporters who obtain news leaks about criminal investigations but would charge federal officials who are their sources. `` The statute clearly calls for prosecution of those involved in misusing sensitive information that comes to them in an official capacity,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. Accurate leaks `` have a tendency to compromise ongoing investigations,'' he said. `` If they are inaccurate, they have a tendency to unjustifiably smear the reputations of persons who are the subject of the leak.''

<HEAD>Azerbaijani Workers Strike to Back Territorial Demand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Workers at dozens of factories and businesses were on strike for a second day today in the republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to press ethnic demands for control of a disputed territory. Workers at about 25 businesses walked out Monday. Nine factories were at a standstill today, said <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barsky </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of the Azerbaijani news agency Azerinform. He spoke in a telephone interview from the southern republic's <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> capital, <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>. Local residents and activists claimed the strike was still broader today, affecting almost 100 enterprises and involving hundreds of thousands of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> residents. The walkout was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a grassroots group fighting for Azerbaijani control over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a mostly Armenian region taken away from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> this year. Armenians in their neighboring republic were protesting to annex the area, and the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> put it under its own direct control this year in an effort to calm tensions. Journalist and interpreter <PERSON> Nazim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragimov </PERSON> said today's stoppage included an oil refinery, several defense plants, an air-conditioner factory and five loading docks.

 An inquest opened today into the sinking of a pleasure boat on the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION>, and new safety regulations went into effect. Police raised the death toll to 26 after another body was discovered. Police said 31 others are missing and believed dead from the accident Sunday, in which the Marchioness was rammed by a sand-and-gravel dredger, the <LOCATION> Bowbelle </LOCATION>, and 79 survived. Earlier, police said 37 were missing and 87 survived. The Transport and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said crewmen based at <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pier </LOCATION>, near the Houses of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, decided at a mass meeting early today to cancel all pleasure boat sailings until the wreckage is removed. `` The men feel very sad about what has happened and they feel they just ca n't operate while the Marchioness wreck is still lying there,'' said union spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cashman </PERSON>. The latest body was found near <LOCATION> Battersea </LOCATION>, about 2 miles upstream from the wreckage, police said. The Marchioness was resting on a sandy bank at the riverside near the accident site, exposed to view at low tides. A young crowd of guests from the worlds of fashion and banking were partying aboard the 90-ton pleasure boat, which sank in the fast-flowing tidal river within a few minutes. At a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> coroner's court, the inquest into the 16 bodies which have been identified opened briefly and was then adjourned by coroner Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapman </PERSON>. It will resume after other inquiries are completed. Under British law, the inquest had to open before the victims could be buried. Two new regulations for pleasure boats on the busy Thames went into effect today. They were announced Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>. One covers checks on passenger numbers. Captains are already required to count passengers to ensure the boats are not overloaded. Now they will have to leave a record of passenger totals at their headquarters before sailing. Tidal Cruises, the company that owns the Marchioness, has denied the vessel was overcrowded. The vessel, hired for the 26th birthday party of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasconcellos </PERSON>, went down shortly after leaving on a 1 a.m.-to-dawn trip. The dredger struck the Marchioness from behind and then ran it over, shearing off the pleasure boat's top deck. The wreckage carried underwater scores of people who had been drinking and dancing below deck. <PERSON> Vasconcellos </PERSON> and the captain, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Faldo </PERSON>, were among those still missing. The other new regulation says pleasure boat passengers must be given more information about what to do in an emergency. Up to now, passengers have not normally been given any instructions about escape routes or safety equipment. A <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard spokeswoman said Monday that police investigators are considering bringing criminal charges over the disaster. She said charges of `` unlawful killing,'' roughly similar to manslaughter, and other related charges are being considered but she refused to elaborate. Police on Monday said they had released the dredger's captain and second mate, who were arrested and questioned after the sinking. They said they also interviewed the five other members of the dredger's crew. Along with police, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>'s Marine Accident Investigation Branch and the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> were investigating the accident. The Independent and Evening Standard newspapers on Monday reported a disagreement had developed between the two captains over which vessel had the right of way under the central span of <LOCATION> Southwark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, where the collision occurred. `` It seems that both captains thought that they were in the right, but technically the actions of both could be held up to scrutiny,'' the Standard quoted an unnamed river authority source as saying. But <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON> of Tidal Cruises said that although smaller craft usually stick to the side arches, <PERSON> Faldo </PERSON> was correct to move through the center Sunday because of tide conditions. `` We do not know what went wrong,'' she said. `` Our captain was acting totally correctly.'' Police said they listened tape-recorded radio traffic between the captains of both vessels and shore control for clues into the cause of the crash. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard declined to comment on the newspaper reports.

 A relief organization of Lebanese Americans today announced an emergency campaign to collect medical and pharmaceutical supplies for four besieged hospitals in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The Save <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> organization said it received telephone calls recently from doctors in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> appealing for urgent donations of insulin, oxygen, bandages, hospital linens and cooking gas. The Lebanese capital has been devastated by five months of fighting between <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> troops and their Moslem allies and the Christian forces controlling <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s army. Nearly 800 people have been killed and more than 2,000 wounded.

 A career Marine infected with the same AIDS virus that killed his wife and son testified in his $ 55 million lawsuit that government doctors passed the disease to his family through a tainted transfusion. Dressed in civilian clothes and maintaining a stoic demeanor, Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> told the court Monday that government doctors botched his wife's pregnancy and eventually decimated his family. <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON>'s testimony came on the opening day of his non-jury trial in his lawsuit against the federal government in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. His daughter, <PERSON> Maureene </PERSON>, 6, the only member of the family to escape infection, sat in the courtroom with a relative who gave her a coloring book. <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> has said he filed the lawsuit primarily to provide for his daughter, since she may well become an orphan. `` It's a relief just to finally be here,'' <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> said. At issue is <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON>'s charge that doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, were negligent in the handling of his wife's 1981 pregnancy. The couple's son was stillborn, and <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON>'s wife then was given a blood transfusion tainted with the deadly virus, the lawsuit alleges. The couple's 13-month-old son, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, born after an ensuing pregnancy, died in 1986. Tests determined he and the parents all had the AIDS virus. The mother, <PERSON> Mutsuko </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON>, 38, died in May 1987. `` Had Mrs. <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> received appropriate treatment, the <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> family today would be intact and happy,'' <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> Jaclyn </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenney </PERSON> said before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Rya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowler </PERSON> countered that <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> doctors maintained an adequate and `` professional standard of care'' during Mrs. <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON>'s pregnancy. <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON>, who tested positive for the AIDS virus but so far shows no symptoms of the disease, testified that a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> doctor in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> saw his wife sometime around her due date in August 1981 and declined to induce labor, saying he `` likes to have these things happen naturally and let nature take its course.'' When Mrs. <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> went to the hospital on Sept. 19 complaining of abdominal pains, she was seen only by a nurse who sent her home, <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> testified. On Sept. 21, she returned to the hospital with similar pains and was told her baby had died sometime over the past two days. Mrs. <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> underwent a Cesarean section and was then given two units of blood. One of them, was infected with the AIDS virus, <PERSON> McKenney </PERSON> said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials and a <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> internist who treated Mrs. <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> traced the two donors, one of whom tested negative for the AIDS virus. The other, discharged from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for homosexual activity, refused to be tested. <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> and his daughter now live on base at the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Weymouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, about 15 miles south of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Shortly after <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> was transferred there, base officials refused to allow <PERSON> Maureene </PERSON> to attend the day care center because of the family's history of AIDS infection. <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> called upon Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to intervene and <PERSON> Maureene </PERSON> was eventually allowed to attend. Doctors said there is no explanation why some children born to a woman with AIDS get the disease and others do not. They also say it is unlikely <PERSON> Maureene </PERSON> will develop AIDS at this late date.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, general secretary of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said in remarks published today he is ready to step down to avoid a power struggle within the political leadership, but the party must decide. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>'s statement in an interview with the party daily <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION> was the first time he acknowledged the power struggle, and it appeared to signal his defeat by party reformers. `` Many people believe that the main cause of the current problems is the power struggle within the party ... I would not like to have a power struggle, as it would not do any good to either the party or the country,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said in interview excerpts carried today by the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>. However, he was also quoted as saying, `` Even if I myself want to retire, it is the ... party that will bring the decision.'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> gave no date for whenhe might retire. A party congress is scheduled to start Oct. 6. On Sunday, party secretary <PERSON> Pal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanyi </PERSON> told a rally marking the day of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>, the founder of the Hungarian state, that <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> was planning to resign. In a June interview with the independent daily <PERSON> Mai </PERSON> <PERSON> Nap </PERSON>, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said he wanted to quit after elections next year. The Communists have said they will allow candidates other than their own to run in those elections, due by June. They would be the first freely contested races in this country since the Communists consolidated power in 1948. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> became Communist Party leader in May 1988. He is considered a party centrist who jockeyed for middle ground between the reformers and party conservatives wary of moves toward a multi-party system. The general secretary, however, was forced into the background two months ago during a leadership reshuffle when his post was included in a four-man leadership group controlled by party reformers.

 A prison guard says he's been made a scapegoat in the prison break by two inmates whose wives allegedly commandeered a helicopter, and adds that he never got an order to shoot at the craft. Guard <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> was suspended with pay following the spectacular escape Friday from the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION>. He had been stationed in a tower and armed with a .308 - caliber He said his finger was on the trigger and he was ready to shoot if he had gotten an order from prison superintendent <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON>. Convicts <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> were captured with their wives about eight hours later in <LOCATION> Holdrege </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, 400 miles away, after a shootout with law enforcement officers. They had transferred from the helicopter to a van a few miles from the prison, leaving the helicopter pilot tied up but unhurt. The inmates and their wives, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, were charged Monday in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> with attempted murder. Bail was set at $ 1 million for all of them except <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, whose arraignment was postponed until later today because he is still under treatment for a hand wound suffered in the shootout. On Monday, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, 25, gave his first detailed account of what happened when the helicopter landed in the prison exercise yard. `` Radio traffic became heavy and everybody was yelling on the radio,'' <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said. `` I was prepared to use lethal force when -LRB- <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> -RRB- gave the order. I never heard the order to shoot.'' <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, a guard at the prison since December 1987, is to appear at a hearing Wednesday that will determine if he will keep his job. He disputed <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON>'s assessment that he froze up. `` It was n't that I could n't pull the trigger,'' <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said. `` I could have. That's my job. I was prepared but I did n't hear the order.'' He said he heard <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> order another tower to use lethal force, but he did not hear that order directed to the tower where he was stationed. In addition, he said: `` Tower 1 was in my line of fire, plus the helicopter was still in the compound. If I would have shot it, it would have exploded and crashed into the cellblock. A lot of people would have been killed.'' <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said Monday he would not respond to <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>' account of the helicopter escape. `` That's what the personnel hearing is all about,'' <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. `` He's had the weekend to think it over and he's come up with some interesting suggestions.'' Sometimes radio transmissions are recorded at the prison, but <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said Friday's escape happened too fast and no recordings were made.

 The battle to build the county's first synagogue got the backing of religious leaders in the face of resident opposition and defacing of signs at the proposed site with swastikas. Residents opposed the site at the county planning board's meeting last week, but the board unanimously recommended approval. The county commission was scheduled to review the proposal tonight. About 15 clergy from several faiths _ including <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Unitarian </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> _ met Monday with officials from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Snellville </ORGANIZATION> after several of the residents' comments were called anti-semitic. The clergy issued a joint statement that read in part: `` It is our perception that the majority of the people of <LOCATION> Gwinnett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> support religious liberty and respect the religious pluralism of our community. ... We Christian ministers and religious leaders here assembled reject anti-semitism in all its forms, welcome the establishment of <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> David </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Synagogue </ORGANIZATION> and pledge our complete support and love.'' `` The real story here is a positive one,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baroff </PERSON>, rabbi of <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> David </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There will come a day when there are Hindu and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> groups in <LOCATION> Gwinnett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.

A synagogue in her neighborhood, she said, `` would be like us going into an all-French neighborhood and building a Baptist church. It's odd.'' A sign on the site of the proposed synagogue has twice been defaced with swastikas.

 Explorers set out for the wreck of the <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> today, hoping to use an underwater robot to get new explanations for the <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> disaster almost 14 years ago. The 729-foot steel freighter took on water and snapped in two during a storm in November 1975, sending it and all 29 crewmen to the bottom of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION>. No bodies were recovered. The three-day expedition began early today from <LOCATION> Whitefish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> under rainy skies. Researchers will use a robot carrying video cameras to reach the wreck 556 feet beneath the surface, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Farnquist </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipwreck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and one of three expedition leaders. The search will test newly developed video equipment and its uses for underwater archeology. Science aside, `` the carrot in there is: ` Wow, we get to see the Fitzgerald,''' <PERSON> Farnquist </PERSON> said Monday. The wreck of the <LOCATION> Fitzgerald </LOCATION> lies about 17 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Whitefish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> was hauling more than 27,000 tons of iron ore from <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> when it ran into a gale on the eastern end of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION>. The boat disappeared from radar without even a distress call. The wreck was memorialized in song by <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lightfoot </PERSON> and remains the subject of public fascination, <PERSON> Farnquist </PERSON> said. `` It's the most historic of the recent wrecks, and it should n't have happened, in this modern age of sailing,'' he said from his home in <LOCATION> Sault </LOCATION> Ste <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> team in 1976 used a cable-controlled device to record black and white video images of the boat, the front half of which still sat upright in the mud bottom. <PERSON> Farnquist </PERSON> said this week's expedition should provide clear footage that could shed light on what exactly caused the boat to break. The federal Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is loaning its research vessel Grayling for the expedition. Television station <ORGANIZATION> WQED </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> will film the search for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. The camera-carrying robot, from Deep Sea Systems International of <LOCATION> Falmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, can venture 150 feet away from its submersible cage, allowing researchers to cover 300 feet of the wreckage at a time. `` It's going to be great,'' <PERSON> Farnquist </PERSON> said.

 National police said today they started proceedings to hand over a reputed cocaine finance chief to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a test of a new emergency plan for extraditing alleged top narcotics traffickers. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, arrested during the weekend in the northern <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sucre </ORGANIZATION>, is wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in connection with the laundering of vast sums of cocaine profits. Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmona </PERSON>, chief of the national police force's judicial investigations division, told reporters that proceedings for <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>' extradition began this morning. The government, responding to a wave of assassinations, launched an emergency crackdown on the drug underworld on Friday that included a new extradition program. <PERSON> Carmona </PERSON> said the procedure included notes to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy informing them of the detention of <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a 35-year-old economist. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said he had no immediate comment on <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>' arrest. According to Col. <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Arellano </PERSON>, the police commander for <PERSON> Sucre </PERSON>, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was nabbed in a raid on a rural estate in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coastal town of <LOCATION> Tolu </LOCATION>, about 340 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. `` There was no resistance, really because of the surprise with which they -LRB- police agents -RRB- acted,'' <PERSON> Arellano </PERSON> said in an interview broadcast Monday night by the private national radio network <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> on Monday reported that, when arrested, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> had none of the heavily armed bodyguards that customarily accompany drug lords. It said that, in statements made while jailed in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> declared his innocence. `` At no time have I had links to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel and I do n't know any of its members,'' he was quoted as saying The arrest raid was one of more than 300 carried out nationwide since an emergency crackdown launched by the government late Friday, in response to the assassinatin by the cocaine cartels of a presidential candidate, a police colonel and a magistrate. More raids were being reported regularly. According to national police headquaters today, 10,972 people have been detained nationwide in 467 raids by police and military forces so far in the crackdown. Police said a total of 473 arms, many of them high-powered automatic weapons, have been seized. Authorities impounded 1,140 cars and trucks, 22 yachts, 135 planes and 15 helicopters, police said. They said that, in many cases, the aircraft were being grounded only until the owners could prove they had been legitimately purchased and were being used for legal activities. As part of the crackdown, President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> also signed a decree empowering his government to summarily extradite suspected traffickers without approval by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s judges, many of whom have been threatened or killed by hitmen. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had been pressuring Barco to take the action since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 nullified a 1979 extradition agreement. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shults </PERSON>, said as many as 100 Colombians are being considered for possible extradition, including three leaders of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel: <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>. The drug cartel is believed responsible for bringing up to 80 percent of the Colombian cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, authorities say. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday praised the steps <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> was taking and offered `` appropriate assistance as rapidly as possible,'' a White House statement said. It said <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that sending in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops was not necessary. Officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said Monday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is preparing to send a small team of police experts to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to advise judges, magistrates and journalists on how to improve security. The special $ 5 million program was approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> more than a year ago. According to officials, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> narrowly escaped capture by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents earlier this year in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. He was allegedly in charge of finances for the powerful cartel of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, an industrial city that serves as the world's principal trafficking center for cocaine. Other reputed cartel leaders continued to elude arrest. `` We have n't yet been able to capture the drug cartel chiefs, but we have struck hard against their immense fortunes,'' army Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnet </PERSON> <PERSON> Locarno </PERSON> said Monday in the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, another trafficking center. The military claimed the raids and property seizures were inflicting a painful blow on the dealers' economic empire. Early Monday on <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s northern fringes, the army swarmed over an opulent compound owned by <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>. The estate included tennis, soccer and basketball courts, a duck pond with a water wheel, a modern gym with weight-lifting equipment, an indoor swimming pool, billards and ping pong tables and a pet eagle. Soldiers guarding the compound said it was just one of dozens of properties owned by <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>. Scores of other properties owned by <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> also were raided. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Caffrey </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed Monday that <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> was a defendant in the `` Polar Cap'' investigation of drug money laundering involving the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. <PERSON> Caffrey </PERSON> said it was unclear whether he would be extradited to stand trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. One former cartel leader, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, was extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987, before the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> struck down the extradition treaty. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is now in federal prison in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, serving a life sentence without parole plus 135 years. In the last eight years, drug traffickers in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation have killed more than 50 judges, including a dozen <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices, as well as a justice minister, an attorney general and several journalists.

 A Bronx couple were arrested today and charged with raping and sodomizing nine of their children, and three other children were missing and believed murdered, police said. The identities of the 34-year-old mother and the 45-year-old father were not immediately released. Both were charged with nine counts of sodomy and rape, according to police spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. The investigation which led to the charges began on May 25, when the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> took the nine children, who ranged in age from 4 months to 16 years, away from the couple. Detectives discovered the couple had three other children during interviews with people who knew the family, but could not account for the missing children, who they believe were murdered. Diggers were scheduled to begin unearthing a vacant lot where the bodies of two of the children were believed to be buried. The whereabouts of the third child's body was not known, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said.

 Striking Eastern pilots said they felt betrayed by the failure of their union's executive board to agree to a national work stoppage. `` We have a whole lot of Eastern pilots who are extremely, extremely disappointed,'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosak </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said Monday. `` We see a tremendous lack of leadership, a lack of guts, a lack of moral fiber.''

 Two men arrested on charges of plotting to kidnap, molest and kill a boy in a pornographic videotape had advertised in computer bulletin boards, according to a court document. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> disclosed Monday that <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambey </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Depew </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, were arrested Aug. 14 after a six-month investigation involving more than 100 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, area. They were being held without bail pending grand jury action. The two men, charged with conspiracy to kidnap, had not targeted a particular child, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. `` The plan was to kidnap a child from northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> or purchase the child through a group of people,'' he said. Lambey and <PERSON> Depew </PERSON> used computer bulletin board networks to advertise their sexual preference. One of the men said he could buy a child for $ 12,000 from an out-of-state source, according to an official who spoke to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on condition of anonymity. Authorities said the boy would be videotaped while being tortured for up to two weeks and his body washed in acid to remove evidence before being disposed of in a marsh in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. The investigation began in February when an undercover <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> police officer tapped into a computer bulletin board system `` designed to assist people seeking contact with others interested in diverse sexual pursuits,'' according to a court affidavit unsealed in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> on Monday. The officer placed a message in the bulletin board seeking individuals interested in children. <PERSON> Lambey </PERSON>, a real estate agent, responded, saying he liked boys between the ages of 8 and 13, and was interested in making a sexually explicit movie with children, the document said. <PERSON> Lambey </PERSON> said in a telephone conversation with the police officer that `` I think the pleasure of doin' it would be worth it,'' the affidavit said. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, Police Chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, whose officers were involved in the probe, called the case a `` model of national law enforcement cooperation'' and singled out three undercover men for praise. Authorities said the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> officers traveled to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> several times and met with the suspects, discussing the purchase of the child for use in the video, before contacting federal officials who took over the case. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said `` <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents from <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> followed them 24 hours a day to make sure no child or citizen was placed in danger.'' <PERSON> Depew </PERSON>, who works as a computer clerk, stored detailed descriptions of his sadomasochistic acts under the heading of `` vital info'' on an office computer, the affidavit said. The two men face life in prison if convicted, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Five Groups File Suit Seeking Use Of Devices To Protect Turtles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Five conservation organizations sued <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, claiming he is legally bound to require that shrimpers use devices protecting endangered sea turtles from drowning in their nets. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> suspended the regulations on the turtle excluder devices after shrimpers, angry about having to use devices they claim reduce their catch by as much as one-third, blockaded shipping channels along the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION>. Under a court order to protect endagered sea turtles in a separate lawsuit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> then ordered shrimpers who do n't use devices to limit their trawling times to 105 minutes. The latest lawsuit, filed late Monday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, seeks to force <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> to resume enforcement of the suspended regulations. The principal known cause of death for the endangered or threated sea turtles of breeding or sub-adult age is drowning in shrimp nets, the lawsuit said. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates more than 11,000 sea turtles will drown annually in the nets of American shrimp fishermen who do not use the excluder device. Comment on the lawsuit was not immediately available from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> today. `` Defendant's action in suspending the ... regulations and replacing them with ineffective, inadequate interim regulations is causing irreparable harm to plaintiffs and their members by depriving them of the opportunity to study, observe, photograph and otherwise use and enjoy living sea turtles on their nesting beaches and in coastal waters,'' the suit said. The five conservation groups say suspension of the regulations and the limited trawls `` fail to provide for the effective conservation'' of five endangered species of sea turtles. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s actions were taken in `` disregared of the clear requirements'' of several laws, including the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, the lawsuit said. Filing the lawsuit are the Environmental Defense Fund, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>, Greenpeace-U.S.A., and Defenders of Wildlife.

 <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Brucker </PERSON> is a Little League slugger with pierced ears and shoulder-length hair. <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> is the leading home-run hitter for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, one of eight teams competing in the Little League World Series this week. She's also the first American girl to play in the series, which also will have its first woman umpire. `` She's just one of the guys,'' said <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>'s teammate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>. But while the rest of the team sleeps in a bunkhouse on the Little League complex, <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> stays with a chaperone at a nearby hotel. <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>, a first baseman, led <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> with nine home runs as the 12-year-olds advanced to win the Western Regional title and a spot in the series. She also pitches on occasion. `` It's fun,'' said the shy right-hander. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Speziale </PERSON>, a 35-year-old mother of two from <LOCATION> Dunkirk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, drew the assignment of umpiring at first base for today's World Series opener between <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> champion <LOCATION> Kaohsiung </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, and European champion <LOCATION> Dhahran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. `` I'm not here to be the first woman. I'm here because I worked at it and they gave me a chance,'' said <PERSON> Speziale </PERSON>. `` It's a dream come true.'' <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> is the second girl to play in the 43 years the Little League World Series has been held. <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON>, a substitute for European champion <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, was the first in 1984. Players on <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>'s team said opposing pitchers learn quickly not to take the 5-foot-3, 137-pound girl lightly. `` They just pitch her fastballs and she hits them out. They think she's a girl so they just pitch fastballs,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Pesusich </PERSON>, a backup third baseman. Lately, though, she has been gaining respect. In one of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>'s 17 tournament games en route to the Little League World Series, the opposing team walked her intentionally after she hit a home run. `` She's pretty good,'' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> Manager <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dileva </PERSON> said. For her part, <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> appears most excited about her first trip out of state. `` Who would have thought in the first trip out of state to be in the World Series?'' she asked. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> opens in the World Series Wednesday against Southern Regional champion <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, at 2 p.m. <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> said she does n't remember exactly how she started playing baseball, but she began competitively at age 9 She said she wants to continue playing competitively with Senior League next year. <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>'s 8-year-old younger brother, <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>, plays baseball. Younger sisters <PERSON> Veronia </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON>, 8, play softball. Last year, <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> watched the Western Regional finals between teams from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` I thought it would be pretty nice getting in there,'' she said. Little League does n't keep records on how many girls play baseball in the program. Little League also offers softball for girls. <PERSON> Creighton </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> president, said teams send rosters to the headquarters but many have only first initials and some first names could be boys or girls. `` We do n't see many girls at high-level tournament play,'' he said.

<HEAD>Disbarred Lawyer Again Mum Before Senate Impeachment Panel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Disbarred lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Borders </PERSON> today refused for a third time to testify in the impeachment trial of federal Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> and was warned that his silence would mean a return to jail. `` We do not have any interest in putting you in jail, but that is the established procedure,'' Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., told Borders after the one-time political power broker refused to answer questions A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee is gathering evidence against <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, a 52-year-old federal judge from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> accused of plotting with Borders to obtain a $ 150,000 payoff and lying about it to a jury that acquitted him in 1983. He also is charged with improper disclosure of wiretap information. Once the panel finishes its report, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will vote on whether to remove <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> from the bench and thus take away his $ 89,500 salary. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeached him last year. Borders served 33 months in federal prison following his 1982 conviction on the conspiracy charge. He has been disbarred and shorn of the considerable political influence officials say he wielded here in the late 1970s. He was arrested in October 1981 as he pulled out of a suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> motel with a garment bag packed with $ 125,000 and a retired <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent masquerading as a racketeer by his side. Borders refused to answer questions from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee on July 24 and July 27, even though he already had been granted immunity from prosecution. He said requiring him to testify would violate his constitutional rights, including his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination. A court on Aug. 17 directed him to return to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee and answer its questions or face jail for contempt of court. <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, the only senator on hand for today's session, appeared to be irritated when Borders sought to fence with him verbally over legal technicalities. Borders questioned why it was necessary to ask 10 questions when it was clear he would not answer. `` When we're dealing with the integrity of a federal judge perhaps no number of questions would be excessive,'' <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> said. Borders also complained that he should not have to answer questions because a quorum of the 12-member committee was not present. But <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> reminded him that before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> went on its August break, the panel agreed that one lawmaker would constitute a quorum for purposes of hearing testimony from Borders.

<HEAD>Lithuanian Commission Calls Annexation `International Crime'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Lithuanian government commission said in a report today that the small <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>'s annexation by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1940 was an `` international crime.'' The report by a commission of the republic's Supreme Soviet, or parliament, was published in the official press on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the 1939 agreement between <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that led to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> annexation of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and its sister Baltic states, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. Thousands of Lithuanians were expected to gather later today for a rally in the capital, <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, to mark the anniversary. On Wednesday, organizers are predicting that 1.5 million Baltic residents will form a human chain from <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, on the Gulf of <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> to the Polish border. `` The realization of the illegal German-Soviet agreements of 1939-1941 constitute an international crime,'' said the published report. `` Elimination of the consequences are not only an internal matter of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION>, but a matter of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the entire society of world governments.'' The agreements `` pre-determined a loss of sovereignty and independence of the Lithuanian republic, and its forced inclusion in the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION>,'' said the report, which later will go before the full parliament. A commission of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> national </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> parliament </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> also has investigated the pact and in a preliminary draft said it should be declared `` null and void.'' But it stopped short of criticizing the incorporation of the then-independent Baltic states into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Lithuanian report goes much further than <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has been willing to go and reflects how strong the grassroots reform movement, <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION>, and its backers have become in the republic. Soviet Communist Party Politburo member <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, in an interview with the party newspaper Pravda, said last week there was no connection between the secret protocol under which <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> divided <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> into spheres of influence and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s decision to join the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> is a close adviser to President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s chief ideologist. He also is chairman of the national commission on the Stalin-Hitler agreement. However, at a news conference in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> Communist Party's chief ideologist, <PERSON> Justas </PERSON> <PERSON> Paleckis </PERSON>, told reporters that, `` All <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> is striving for sovereignty and independence _ we are n't afraid of that word.'' He said independence could not be achieved soon, and the exact nature of it remains to be determined.

A report from a ship that passed near <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>'s center led forecasters today to upgrade the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> storm to a hurricane with 75 mph winds, the National Hurricane Center said. The ship relayed its observations after the storm pushed through a low-pressure trough that boosted its strength, forecasters said. Earlier in the day, the storm's winds had been estimated at only 45 mph. <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>'s center was located at 10 a.m. EDT about 1,100 miles southwest of the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION> near 29.7 north latitude and 44.7 <LOCATION> west </LOCATION> <LOCATION> longitude </LOCATION>, said forecasters at the hurricane center in suburban <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>. The system moving north-northwest at about 17 mph was given little chance of making it to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a hurricane, forecasters said. While the hurricane posed no danger to land, it was touching shipping lanes. `` It's like the I-95 of the ocean between <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebaugh </PERSON>, weather service specialist, referring to the interstate highway that runs along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. The weather service routinely requests information from ships sailing within 300 nautical miles of a storm, he said. <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> formed as a tropical depression Friday off <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and became a named storm Sunday night when sustained winds reached 39 mph. Hurricanes are formed when winds hit 74 mph. There have been seven depressions in the current <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Before <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>, four had become named storms and two of those had developed into hurricanes.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said today it is ready to provide a wide array of assistance to help <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> battle drug lords, but it reiterated that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are not an option. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not offer Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> military assistance in a telephone call Monday night, `` nor did President <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> request it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, during his conversation with the vacationing president, reinforced earlier statements by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops would not be dispatched to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, according to a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> statement issued late Monday. `` We are always prepared to give <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> the assistance and support they request'' short of sending <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, Ms. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> said at a news briefing today. However, she said <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s government has not said what additional help it wants. `` There have n't been any specific requests for anything other than what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been doing,'' she said. `` We'll provide training, research, operations like that,'' Ms. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> said. She said one possibility would be to give Colombian judges the same anti-terrorist training given to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats _ if such help were requested by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said one of the biggest helps to <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION>'s crackdown on drug traffickers may be the promise to begin extradition proceedings against drug figures wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` They -LRB- drug lords -RRB- fear extradition and they do n't want to be prosecuted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It's a real weapon he -LRB- Barco -RRB- can use,'' said presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. Monday's <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> statement said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called Barco to express condolences over the assassination last week of the leading Colombian presidential candidate, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>. `` The president assured President <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> of his strong support, and expressed his admiration for the steps he has taken to restore law and order,'' the statement said. And, while the statement said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would `` render appropriate assistance as rapidly as possible,'' it added: `` President <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> indicated he had read press speculation about the use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. He affirmed to the president that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops would not be necessary.'' Earlier, White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> voiced a similar view. `` I think the tradition in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> has been a reluctance on the part of anybody to ask for troops and I think there's a reluctance on the part of the president to commit troops unless the situations are extreme,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, whose Monday meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> included a discussion of the president's upcoming anti-drug plan, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no plans to use <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to combat drug trafficking in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> or anywhere else in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. His comments seemed an effort to soften Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s suggestion Sunday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should consider sending military troops to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> if requested by the government of that violence-torn nation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today again had no public events on his schedule as he enjoys a vacation marked by morning jogs, tennis, boating and golf. First lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, however, was returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for an eye examination at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> for a lingering condition stemming from Graves disease, a thyroid imbalance. Despite treatment earlier this year with radioactive iodine, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continues to be troubled by eye irritation and some double vision, aides said. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s anti-drug package, which the president will unveil in a televised speech to the nation Sept. 5 from the Oval Office, is largely complete. The aide put the final price tag at from $ 7.5 billion to $ 8 billion. To a large extent, the program will involve shuffling funds from existing anti-drug programs into expanded new ones. The program also will call for $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion in new annual federal spending. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said the plan's focus is on the domestic side. `` It involves dealing with the issues associated with law enforcement within our country, with rehabilitation assistance to those who are addicted to drugs.'' `` It deals with programs on education, and that's the primary thrust. But there is a component of additional assistance for countries around the world that may ask for some economic aid ... to allow them to fight the problem,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said.

 Police today arrested nine white anti-apartheid activists in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, and witnesses said authorities used tear gas to break up student protests of next month's segregated elections. Conflict between police and activists has escalated over the past few days as a mass defiance campaign against apartheid laws and emergency restrictions spread to most major cities. Anti-apartheid groups today mounted the greatest number of protests since they began the campaign earlier this month. Protest organizers announced plans to extend the civil disobedience to whites-only schools. Police arrested the activists outside city hall in the port city of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> while they were tying yellow ribbons around palm trees and handing out pamphlets calling for an end to mandatory military service for white males. The activists belong to the End Conscription Campaign, which vowed Monday to operate openly though it is banned by the white-led government. Police arrested five people Monday at a demonstration by the organization, which seeks a system of alternative national service for white men who do n't want to serve in the military. In <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, students at several mixed-race and Indian schools set up barricades of burning tires on streets near their schools. Students in the mixed-race township of <LOCATION> Athlone </LOCATION> township also stoned a fire engine, forcing firefighters to flee. At an Indian high school, students used the flagpole to raise the green, gold and black banner of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. Students at several schools hung banners calling for a boycott of the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections that exclude the black majority. Police used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators at four schools, witnesses said. A number of leading anti-apartheid groups have unilaterally declared themselves `` unbanned'' as part of the defiance campaign, which began Aug. 2. The organizers say they are mounting non-violent protests to end segregation of hospitals, neighborhoods, schools, beaches and other facilities. Police have responded by banning or breaking up some rallies and arresting or detaining without charge dozens of activists. Hundreds of activists released from detention have been placed under restriction orders that limit their movements and political activities. A spokesman for Minister of Law and <PERSON> Order </PERSON> <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said today that people who violate those orders `` will sooner or later have to appear in court to answer criminal charges.'' By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. The <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a loosely based coalition organizing the protests, said black teachers and students would began presenting themselves at whites-only schools in coming days. The coalition set no exact date or location for the protests. Police said a small mine exploded before dawn today at a post office outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. It caused no injuries, and there were no immediate claims of responsibility.

 A man distraught by the explosion of a fireworks-laden car that killed his son and seven others jumped to his death from a six-story building Tuesday, police said. <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigal </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> had been questioned Sunday about the explosion the previous day, according to a police spokesman in this southeastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> port city. <PERSON> Rigal </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 55, had been depressed about the accident, the spokesman quoted neighbors as saying. <LOCATION> Alicante </LOCATION> province Civil Governor <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdecantos </PERSON> said the elder <PERSON> Rigal </PERSON> and his son distributed fireworks for a factory, <PERSON> Pirotecnica </PERSON> <PERSON> Levantina </PERSON>, which had been ordered closed Aug. 3 for safety violations.

<HEAD>Drop in Durable Goods Orders Indicates Slowing Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for `` big ticket'' durable goods tumbled 1.9 percent in July to the lowest level in nine months, the government said Tuesday, providing further evidence of a weakening economy. It was the fourth drop this year in the sector, which includes items, from washing machines to warships, expected to last three or more years. The sector is considered a bellwether of the economy's performance The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said demand for durable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $ 122.9 billion last month, the lowest level since October 1988. Orders rose faster than expected, increasing 1.4 percent in June. That followed a 4.5 percent plunge in May, the steepest drop in 10 months. Orders had risen in April and March and fallen in February and January. `` The numbers are up and down, up and down, but overall the downs outweigh the ups in 1989,'' said economist <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> DRI </ORGANIZATION> @ <ORGANIZATION> McGraw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm The latest drop came despite moves by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> since early June to nudge interest rates lower. Earlier, the central bank had been raising rates to dampen economic vigor and inflationary pressure. The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank panel controlling short-term interest rates, was meeting privately Tuesday to set monetary policy through early October. Even with the latest sign of sluggishness, most economists said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would not lower interest rates further anytime soon. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s focus is on inflation and it's not going to want to loosen as long as inflation is running between 4.5 percent and 5 percent,'' <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> said. Durable goods are among the sectors most sensitive to interest rates because consumers and businesses usually borrow to buy them. `` The durable goods industry is one of the unfortunate casualties of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s high interest rate policy,'' said economist Lawrence A. Hunter of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` It clearly is time for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to show sympathy ... and to cease fire by lowering interest rates,'' he said. Most of the weakness in July came in military orders, which swing widely from month to month, and non-electrical machinery, an important category which includes computers and a wide variety of industrial equipment. Military orders plunged 14.7 percent to $ 7.6 billion in July following a 17.4 percent rise in June. Excluding the defense category, orders fell 0.9 percent in July after an 0.3 percent gain a month earlier. Non-electrical machinery plummeted 9.7 percent last month, the steepest drop in more than three years, to $ 21.1 billion. That followed a 4.8 percent rise in June. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attributed half the decline to a drop in orders for engines and turbines. In a sign of strength, however, the closely watched non-defense capital goods sector rose 5.0 percent to $ 41.1 billion following a 5.1 percent gain in June. Analysts use this category as a barometer of business investment plans. Economist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a Washington-based consultant, said he expected durable goods sales to turn up later this year. Housing has begun to rebound in response to recent interest rate declines and that in turn will generate sales of appliances and furniture. Also, consumer spending is strengthening now that a surge in inflation earlier this year has subsided, he said. The department offered these other details of July activity: _ Electrical machinery, up 1.3 percent to $ 19.8 billion, following a June gain of 4.8 percent _ Primary metals, including steel, up 0.8 percent to $ 11.9 billion, following a 5.1 percent drop _ Transportation equipment, up 2.3 percent to $ 34.2 billion after a 0.1 percent drop A large increase in aircraft orders offset declines in motor vehicles, shipbuilding and tanks. Shipments of durable goods fell 3.0 percent to $ 118.1 billion in July, following drops of 1.0 percent in June and 0.3 percent in May.

 Four people were killed and 50 wounded in a night of shelling that followed the Christian commander's offer to talk peace with Moslem adversaries, police said Tuesday. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> had not replied by Tuesday to Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s proposal, but its militia allies rejected the offer. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> dispatched two more warships to the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, bringing the number to eight, including an aircraft carrier. The French, who governed <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by mandate until 1943, have said their purpose is to evacuate the 7,000 French nationals in the country if necessary. Police said artillery and rocket exchanges tailed off at dawn and settled into a pattern of intermittent mortar fire across the line that divides Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> from the Christian eastern sector. By police count, 789 people have been killed and 2,190 wounded in the artillery war that began March 8 between a Moslem alliance led by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which has 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and the 20,000 men of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Christian army command. Nearly all the casualties have been civilians. Acting Premier <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem leading a Syrian-backed Moslem cabinet, issued a statement calling the <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> general's offer `` a mine field. Any response to it is highly unlikely.'' Since a political crisis a year ago, the <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> government has competed with one led by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. On Monday, <PERSON> Druse </PERSON> chieftain <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> described the general's offer as `` a trick to allow <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> a breathing spell to rearm and marshall his forces. A spokesman for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said privately the Syrians were `` under Arab and international pressure to stop their involvement in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'' and were `` issuing fake statements on behalf of their allies to give the impression that Lebanese parties are involved in the conflict, not them.'' In an interview published Monday, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> expressed willingness to discuss <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s future with leaders of the other side. He did not make his customary demand that talks could not begin until Syrian forces withdrew. Syrian troops are in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under an Arab League mandate issued in 1976, the year after the beginning of the sectarian civil war, in which more than 150,000 people have been killed. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> calls them an occupation army and has declared a `` war of liberation'' to drive them out. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and told reporters: `` There's obviously no military solution to the problem for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said he met with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to `` emphasize that the military confrontation is not taking us anywhere,'' and added: `` We are delivering the same messages to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabbani </PERSON>, acting religious adviser of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Sunni Moslems, said `` violence can not produce solutions.'' He cautioned <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to use its naval force `` with great wisdom.'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> sources in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said the anti-submarine destroyer <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Vienne </PERSON> and oil supply ship Meuse would join the six other vessels already sent to the area. They include two other destroyers and a frigate in addition to the aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> Foch </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s militia allies describe the naval buildup as an attempt by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to reassert dominance over the region. Iranian newspapers printed warnings to the West that any interference in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> would further aggravate the situation. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> backs Moslem extremists believed to hold most of the 16 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, who include eight Americans, and has about 2,000 Revolutionary Guards in Syrian-controlled east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a group of leftist militias allied with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, said its artillerymen fired on six ships before dawn and prevented them from reaching ports on the Christian-held coast north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> statement said the gunners `` scored direct hits on the lead ship, forcing the whole group to sail away.'' It did not identify any of the vessels. The spokesman for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command denied the claim. `` To begin with, there were no ships heading to our ports this morning,'' he said, on condition of anonymity. `` Also, no force in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> but the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> army is capable of detecting and opening fire at a moving maritime target.'' Syrian and allied forces have besieged the 310-square-mile Christian enclave north and east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> since March 12, four days after the battle began. They shell the coast to keep <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces and the 1 million Christians in the enclave from receiving supplies. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the main Arab foe of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, supplies most of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s arms. Moslem security sources said the Syrians were providing tanks, howitzers and mortars to the 22,000 Moslem soldiers led by Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON> and to <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s Druse militia, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s closest ally in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. One said the Syrians `` have been flooding their allies with weapons and ammunition for more than a week now. It seems they are preparing them for a major battle with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>'s forces, poorly equipped, have stayed out of the fighting.

 State Attorney General <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has abruptly resigned in exchange for an end to a grand jury investigation of allegations that he lied under oath and of his campaign financial records. And today the grand jury indicted a former secretary to <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> on charges that she tried to extort money from him in exchange for keeping quiet about allegations that he got her pregnant. Under an agreement with <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> can not discuss his innocence or guilt regarding the grand jury investigation. `` I do n't believe in beating dead horses. I believe justice was done,'' <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said at a Monday night news conference. `` If you resign from the attorney general's office of the state, that's a pretty darned harsh penalty,'' <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. At a news conference today, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said his decision to resign was based on family obligations, including concerns he had to protect his young daughter, who is at the center of a child custody dispute that gave rise to the perjury allegation. `` No public official is more important that the office he or she holds,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` But my biggest fear was something much worse _ ublicity about my child's life, welfare and current home environment.'' It is the second time this year a major <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> state official has quit amid allegations of misconduct. Treasurer <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, who was accused of mismanaging a state investment fund that lost an estimated $ 279 million and was impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, resigned last month just before his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> trial was to begin. It also was the second criminal case against <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> since he took office in 1984. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s resignation was effective at 5 p.m. Monday. `` It was in the best interest of the state, the best interest of Mr. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, and the best interest of all concerned,'' <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. Gov. <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> will appoint an interim attorney general, who will serve until the next election. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said his office worked `` very intensely'' on the investigation for four weeks. He said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s attorney called his office about noon Monday and agreed to the arrangement, which <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said the prosecutor's office first offered about a week ago before the grand jury began meeting. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 39, a Democrat, had testified Thursday, Friday and Monday before the grand jury. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said he had planned to ask for a vote on charges sometime Monday afternoon or today. In 1986, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was acquitted on charges that he solicited his staff for campaign contributions. The jury agreed with his defense that, because he solicited the contributions after the 1984 election to help pay off his campaign debts, the actions did not violated a state law prohibiting state officials from soliciting contributions for future campaigns. The latest grand jury investigation centered on <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s testimony in a child custody hearing involving his ex-wife, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Hypes-Brown </PERSON>, and their 5-year-old daughter. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> has confirmed that the grand jury was looking into a report that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had denied writing a note that was introduced as evidence in the hearing, then later admitted writing it. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> acknowledged that he denied writing the note but said that it was a mistake and that he realized it almost immediately. He said he requested a brief recess, and when the hearing resumed he corrected his testimony. In a statement today, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that even though he had corrected the statements he made during the hearing, he still would have faced `` potential months of protracted litigation'' if indicted. The <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> reported two weeks ago that the note involved a request for $ 50,000 from <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s former secretary, who the paper said had been impregnated by <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, had an abortion and demanded the money to keep quiet. The secretary, <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, today was indicted on one count each of extortion and obtaining money under false pretenses. The extortion count carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison, while the false pretenses charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years. Shortly after the indictment was announced this morning, attorneys for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> withdrew a $ 3 million libel lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>, saying they did n't want the suit to jeopardize <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s criminal defense <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said he do n't know how much money was allegedly extorted, saying reports have varied from $ 7,500 to $ 50,000. There was no immediate comment from <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>; telephone calls to her home went unanswered. In addition, the grand jury subpoenaed <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s campaign records from 1984 through 1988. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Sherrod </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, is <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s secretary of state.

<TEXT>
 One person was arrested in the slaying of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, a source at the conservationist's remote camp said Tuesday, but officials could not confirm the report. An army officer at the camp in <ORGANIZATION> Kora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said a Somali shopkeeper from the nearby town of <LOCATION> Mbalambala </LOCATION> was arrested Monday, one day after <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> died in an encounter with armed robbers. The officer, who declined to be identified by name or rank, said the suspect had been taken to the police station in the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Garissa </LOCATION> for questioning. The army and police are searching for the killers. Officers at the national police headquarters in the capital, <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, were not immediately available to comment on the report. Wildlife Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>, who was helping direct the hunt for <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>'s killers, said he could not confirm an arrest. A source with experience in security and wildlife matters said even if there had been an arrest, it was not certain the man detained was involved in <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>'s death. `` It's happened before that we've arrested people only to find they're not involved,'' said the source. A survivor of the attack, in which two of <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>'s assistants also were slain, identified the shopkeeper as one of the assailants, the officer in <LOCATION> Kora </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, 83, gained international fame for his efforts along with his wife, <PERSON> Joy </PERSON>, to return lions to the wild. Their exploits were detailed in the film `` Born Free'' and in a sequel, `` Living Free.'' Both movies were based on books by <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, who was killed at the northwestern <LOCATION> Shaba </LOCATION> game reserve in 1980 by servant she had dismissed on suspicion of theft. <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> had lived at the <LOCATION> Kora </LOCATION> reserve since 1971 helping dozens of lions learn to survive in the African bush before turning them loose. He and <PERSON> Joy </PERSON>, who separated in the 1960s, had no children.

<HEAD>Soviets Expect 200,000 to Emigrate This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 200,000 Soviets are expected to emigrate this year and more than 2 million will make visits abroad because of eased travel restrictions, the head of the country's visa agency said Tuesday. About 107,000 Soviets already have received permission to leave for good this year, said <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuznetsov </PERSON>, head of the agency known as UVIR. The agency also approved 1,700,000 applications for visits abroad in the first six months of 1989, three times the number for all of 1987, he said. Most of the emigrants go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The strict Soviet restrictions on travel and emigration have long been a target of censure from the West. Tens of thousands of Jews and other Soviets were refused exit visas, becoming known as `` refuseniks,'' and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> linked tariffs on imported Soviet goods with emigration to try to pressure the Soviets to let more people out. Now, <PERSON> Kuznetsov </PERSON> said at a briefing, fewer than 1 percent of applications are turned down, and almost always for reasons of secrecy. Those refused say officials still apply the criterion of secrecy arbitrarily. A draft law on the liberalization of Soviet travel control is almost ready to be submitted to the legislature, which will meet next month. It brings Soviet emigration rules closer in line with Western practice but still requires would-be emigres to receive an invitation from a firm, friend or relative. `` Lots of our citizens do n't know the language and other things,'' he said, `` and they should at least be met by someone.'' In general, however, the new law takes the approach of `` Let's assume that all our people are honorable people,'' instead of meriting only suspicion and tight control, <PERSON> Kuznetsov </PERSON> said He cautioned that even with passage of the law, Soviet travel would still be subject to technical snarls and red tape. International tickets on <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet airline, are in such hot demand that people must wait months and even years to buy them. They also have to wait days or weeks in line to change rubles into dollars or other hard currency. `` We held people back for a long time, and now we're resolving things, but give us time to solve a series of technical problems,'' <PERSON> Kuznetsov </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials say Soviets are registering their intent to emigrate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at an annual rate of 120,000. About 50,000 have left this year for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, primarily ethnic Germans. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said if the Soviets enact the proposed changes in the travel law, he will urge <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass a one-year waiver of the amendment that links the tariffs with emigration.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said Tuesday the Afghan people are tired of the 11-year-old civil war and his Marxist government `` is prepared to accept any suggestion'' that will end it. In outlining a new peace plan, he called for an international peace conference attended by <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as guarantors of an agreement. His plan includes elections six months after a cease-fire, does not meet demands by Moslem guerrillas that the 42-year-old former intelligence chief step down. `` Our people are fed up with the continuation of this war of attrition ... in which innocent people are dying. The government of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is prepared to accept any suggestion toward a peaceful settlement,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> told reporters at the <LOCATION> Gulkhana </LOCATION> presidential palace. Western experts had predicted the U.S.-supported guerrillas would oust <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government soon after Soviet military forces withdrew on Feb. 15. Six months later, they have failed twice to capture <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and are squabbling among themselves. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government officials said the <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> plan makes a new concession to the guerrillas: Talks on forming a broad-based Consultative Council would be held before a cease-fire rather than after, to quiet suspicion that the government would not negotiate in good faith. A six-month truce leading to elections would begin when the council was established. The council would organize a broad-based coalition government to draft a new constitution and electoral law, which would be approved by a traditional <PERSON> Loyah </PERSON> <PERSON> Jirga </PERSON>, or grand assembly of prominent Afghans. Guerrilla leaders have rejected previous government peace plans because all include <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and his ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in a coalition. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said he was ready to give up the presidency and even his life to achieve peace, but added that ignoring the reality of the party, armed forces and current situation in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> would only `` intensify the war.'' `` Billions of dollars have been spent here,'' he said. `` All kinds of deadly weapons have been accumulated here. Are all these efforts to get <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> to step aside? Does that mean all the atrocities committed in the country are just to get rid of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>? `` In our opinion, instead of talking about the removal of the party or the person, let's talk about the participation of people and parties in trying to achieve peace, `` <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> claimed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was supplying rockets with cluster bombs to the guerrillas, and was guilty of the `` mass massacre'' of civilians as a result. He also said judgments about the Afghan government by other nations, including those in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, were `` being radically changed.'' `` We are confident that ... even the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration is realizing the futility of the continuation of war and will consider the realities of Afghan society as a basis for making new policies,'' he declared. If the guerrillas `` honestly want a settlement of the problem, and they say they control 85 percent of the country,'' he said, `` why are they afraid of elections? Why are they using rockets of mass killing?'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> believed the U.N.-mediated agreement ended with the Soviet withdrawal, `` but the main issue was to stop intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and provide for the return of Afghan refugees.'' `` If all sides remain faithful to the provisions of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement, it is my opinion that peace soon will prevail in our country,'' he said. At an international conference, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said, `` we are ready, that if prestigious and credible international guarantees are given, we can tackle questions of the permanent neutrality of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the demilitarization of the country.'' The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement was signed by <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where about 3.5 million Afghan refugees live and many guerrillas are based, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as guarantors. Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978. Soviet soldiers entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 and an estimated 115,000 were in the country when the withdrawal began on May 15, 1988.

 Astronomers who predicted that <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> would not have rings were surprised to discover a faint but complete ring around the planet today in pictures sent by Voyager 2. Researchers first hailed the image on Voyager's photos as the rediscovery of the `` ghost arc,'' a partial ring identified by the Voyager 2 spacecraft on Aug. 11, but further analysis showed that the arc was a continuous ring around the planet. `` It is <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s first ring,'' said <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, leader of the spacecraft imaging team. `` The inner arc, the one we were unable to find since the discovery -LRB- Aug. 11 -RRB- images, is there, and it is continuous, all the way around.'' Voyager, launched in 1977, is in the final stages of its 4.4 billion-mile trip to <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. It will pass by the outermost planet at 8:55 p.m. PDT Thursday, beaming images back to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Observations of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> had led astronomers to predict that the planet would be encircled by ring arcs _ partial rings. The newly discovered ring is so faint that it was not visible from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> or from earlier Voyager photographs, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` It just is n't enough material to be detected from the ground,'' he said. The ring appeared in a series of 16 photographs of the arc region. They included better views of the other arc discovered Aug. 11. Researchers said that they expect to find more arcs as Voyager passes behind <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and scans the arc region while it is lit from behind by the sun. Ring arcs, unlike anything seen around the other planets, are composed of debris that could be the remnants of moons torn apart by gravitational forces or collisions, researchers said. Voyager's observations of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> on Monday revealed a churning, turbulent atmosphere, with huge white clouds of frozen natural gas, and a string of storms trailing behind an Earth-sized cyclone. One small collection of clouds called the `` scooter'' is whirling around the planet's surface once every 16 hours, faster than anything else so far seen on <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, head of the Voyager imaging team. Photographs of the planet's biggest moon, <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, show it is brighter, cooler and smaller than scientists had thought. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the shots suggest <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> may be partly covered with snow and frozen water. `` It may snow there from time to time,'' he said Monday. The pictures also show dark spots near <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s equator and a pinkish cast that may be from discolored frozen natural gas, or methane. Researchers had speculated that <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> might have oceans of liquid nitrogen, but <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said any such oceans would have to be frozen over. `` Triton is an especially intriguing object,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` It's in the wrong orbit It's going backwards around <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. Something truly catastrophic must have happened some time in its past.'' Scientists believe <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> could have been a comet that collided with one of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s moons because it rotates in the opposite direction from the planet, unlike most moons in the solar system. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, the Voyager project scientist, said such a collision could have slowed <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> enough to allow it to become trapped in a long, oval orbit around <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. As that orbit gradually became more circular, tidal forces would have caused the moon to heat, perhaps turning <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> into a ball of molten rock and water for 1 billion years, he said. If that were the case, more detailed photographs later this week should show that <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> has fewer meteorite craters than it otherwise would have. `` It's very difficult right now to say anything about what's going on on <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Voyager continued to snap pictures of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> today as it moved toward its closest encounter with <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> at 8:55 p.m. PDT Thursday, when it will pass 3,000 miles from the planet. It also searched for auroral lights over <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s south pole and made further observations of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s weather and variations in brightness on <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s surface. The pictures of <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> showed it has a diameter of 1,740 miles, about four-fifths the size of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s moon and about half the size scientists previously thought. Researchers puzzled over the unexpected discovery of the intense weather on <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> is an extremely dynamic planet'' with weather resembling <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s but `` with less than 50 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s energy,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said New photographs show that the Great Dark Spot, an Earth-sized cyclone discovered earlier by Voyager, is leaving in its wake a long tail of swirling storms. Voyager observed winds on Uranus similar to those now being seen on <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, but without the turbulence. <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> contains more heat than Uranus, and the turbulence could be the result of warmer material bubbling up from deep inside the mostly liquid planet, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. On Aug. 13, scientists issued their first weather forecast for <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, predicting with fairly close accuracy where the Great Dark Spot would be last Sunday. `` It's not perfect, but weather forecasting is n't a perfect science,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON>, the scientist in charge of radio astronomy aboard Viking, estimated that <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s day _ the time it takes to complete one rotation on its axis _ is 16 hours. That estimate was based on observations of intense bursts of radio waves every 16 hours from <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s magnetic field, which varies with the planet's rotation. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said observations of the atmosphere suggest that <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s day may be longer than 16 hours <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON> emphasized that his estimate was only a preliminary calculation.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> began filing lawsuits today in nearly a dozen states against demolition companies that allegedly failed to take proper precautions while working on asbestos-ridden buildings. Civil lawsuits were filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in eight cities and additional court papers were expected to be filed later in the day naming a total of 34 defendants in connection with violations of asbestos removal requirements, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Today's coast-to-coast effort to punish violators is a message to those who ignore the law,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> deputy administrator. `` Asbestos is a known cause of cancer in humans, and it can be a killer.'' <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON> said the agency intends to enforce requirements for safety measures when dealing with asbestos removal by seeking civil penalties from companies that do not comply with the safeguards. Fines could range up to $ 25,000 for each violation. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to name all the defendants until the court papers were filed. The eight lawsuits filed today involved work on school buildings in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state as well as various buildings from warehouses to restaurants in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. Papers also were being prepared for civil action involving work on at least 80 school buildings in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, officials said. Federal law requires certain precautions when removing asbestos from buildings so that its microscopic fibers are not spread through the air. Violators can be subject to up to $ 25,000 fine per violation and face criminal prosecution in some cases. The inhalation of asbestos fibers is known to cause lung cancer, asbestosis, a scarring of the lung, and mesothelioma, a cancer of the chest and abdomen. Asbestos was used in past years in insulation and other building materials. Improper removal practices pose health risks to construction workers and people who return to the building or to other nearby buildings since asbestos particles often linger in the air for a long time, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that up to half of all asbestos-involved renovations may be done without the precautions required by the federal Clean Air Act. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said none of the new actions involves criminal charges, but that civil penalties in some of the cases could be over $ 250,000. Agency sources, who asked not to be identified by name, said papers were also to be filed later in the day as a result of violations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The projects cited include work on at least 80 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> school buildings; public schools in <LOCATION> Woodinville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>; a high school in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; a junior high school in <LOCATION> Holyrood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>; and colleges in <LOCATION> Pittsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Berea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. In one case, a contractor was being cited for transporting wine tanks by helicopter from a winery in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, without removing asbestos insulation pads, causing asbestos particles to scatter over miles of countryside. Other cases involved a <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> casino; an apartment building in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; a boiler room at the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Quantico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; the <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, and two <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> restaurants. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> crackdown comes only weeks after a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study indicated that in many cases the improper removal of asbestos from buildings may pose more of a health risk than leaving the material in the building. The study by <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s Energy and <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> suggested that if precautions are not taken the `` removal of asbestos may actually increase exposure to building occupants'' as well as workers involved in the renovation. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that more than 730,000 commercial buildings in the country still contain some asbestos material. Last year it received about 50,000 notifications of renovation projects involving asbestos, and that number is expected to increase by about 30 percent this year, according to agency officials. By law, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> must be notified when renovation or demolitions involve buildings containing asbestos.

 A burned-out cabin light on a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 727 emitted smoke shortly after takeoff today, forcing the plane carrying 115 passengers to return to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> airport, airline officials reported. `` There was no fire, just smoke,'' said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> from the airline's <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> headquarters. Earlier reports from airport tower officials had said there was a fire on board. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said the smoke stopped when the plane's captain turned off the electricity in the area of the light. `` The passenger reaction was quite good,'' said <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>. `` In fact, one passenger joked and said he thought this was a no-smoking flight.'' The plane had just taken off for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> when the emergency happened. It turned around near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, a few minutes out of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and landed back in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> about 9 a.m. and taxied to the gate, where passengers were let off, said tower spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Judge Hears Ringo Tape in Suit To Block Release of Ex-Beatle's Album</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A recording by <PERSON> Ringo </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> debuted in court Tuesday, blaring from a boom box as a judge weighed whether the song would be a $ 3.5 million hit or is an alcohol-marred embarrassment, as the ex-Beatle claims. Music industry executives have said the record would be a `` guaranteed No. 1 hit,'' an attorney for <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, producer Chips <PERSON> Moman </PERSON> said as he played the tape for <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> The song, `` I Can Help,'' is one of 14 <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> recorded with <PERSON> Moman </PERSON> in 1987. <PERSON> Moman </PERSON> wants to release an album to coincide with <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>'s current smash <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concert tour, but <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> says he is unhappy with his performance and the album would hurt his reputation <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> did not rule immediately on whether to extend a 30-day order blocking the record's release. The restraining order expires Thursday. The judge, after telling attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> to `` turn it down,'' listened patiently to <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>'s upbeat rendition of <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swan </PERSON>'s 1975 hit. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, who recently completed a much-publicized treatment for alcoholism, also objects to `` Whiskey and Soda,'' a part of the collection, his attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said Tuesday. `` That is not a song Mr. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> is eager to have released on an album with his name and his picture on the cover,'' <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said. Alcoholism `` is an addiction he was suffering from when this music was recorded,'' <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said of his client. Neither <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Moman </PERSON> attended Tuesday's hearing. Though <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> continued to enjoy high recognition, his recording career had stagnated when he came to <LOCATION> Moman </LOCATION> in 1987, <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Moman </PERSON>, whose work includes producing <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> in the late 1960s, has a reputation for reviving careers, he said. `` The point is this: Two people came together for the purpose of resurrecting a career,'' <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> said. `` This album would do this for <PERSON> Ringo </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ringo </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> has n't had a hit since 1975.'' <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> said the album, if released now while <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> is on tour, could make $ 3.5 million. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> claimed, however, that the album would hurt <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> at a time when his career has been boosted by his tour with his `` All-Starr Band.'' <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said that while the record features <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> singing, he does not play drums on it. `` All an artist has is his style, his name, his professional reputation and his image,'' <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said. `` Here, we've got an album with one of the most famous drummers in music history and he's not playing drums. He does n't want that.'' <PERSON> Moman </PERSON> has contended he invested $ 146,239 in the <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> project, and said he rejected an offer by <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> of $ 100,000 to kill the album.

<TEXT>
 Relatives of those killed on <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 met Tuesday with police officers investigating the bombing of the New York-bound flight and said they were confident the killers would soon be found. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president of the Victims of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, called it `` the most positive meeting we have had so far.'' `` I am very, very confident after this meeting that the terrorists, the people who carried this out, are going to be identified and the next stage is to try to apprehend them,'' he said. `` The police are very confident it is going to take place and the terrorists are going to be identified, we hope in the very near future.'' Asked why he though police would soon identify the bombers, <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON> replied: `` You are not naive enough and I am not naive enough to think that they -LRB- the police -RRB- are going to give us information about the criminal investigation. `` There was a specific overview which makes us feel everything is being done and done most appropriately,'' he said. <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON> stayed Monday night with the Rev. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Keegans </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest whose <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> house was destroyed when parts of the jumbo jet crashed on the southern Scottish town on Dec. 21, 1988. All 259 people aboard were killed along with 11 people on the ground. <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON> and five other Americans were accompanied by <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Squire </PERSON>, head of the British relatives' group. `` Eight months after <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> it appears to us that nothing has been done to increase security at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Squire </PERSON> said on the way into the meeting. The relatives had a private meeting with Detective Chief Superintendent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, the senior investigating officer; <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Esson </PERSON>, Chief Constable of the <LOCATION> Dumfries </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON> regional police force; and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> McFadyen </PERSON>, a senior Scottish law officer. The relatives later visited a building where the Flight 103 victims' clothing and possessions, not yet returned to next of kin, were stored. They saw rows of cardboard cartons and on top of one, a battered gray suitcase. Several police officers wearing overalls and protective gloves were sorting through shirts, shoes and other items of clothing. `` This part was maybe the toughest part of the trip,'' <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON> said. `` It was very emotional.'' On Monday, the relatives met <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> and junior Transport Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON> who rebuffed their call for an immediate public inquiry into the gaps in airline security that allowed the bomb to be placed aboard the plane. <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON> said there was a frank exchange of views, but <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON>, `` We are definitely at odds with some of the statements and the approach'' of his department. `` Mr. <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON> is well aware that we are not pleased with his statements and we were not reassured,'' he said. `` We are not satisfied on the position that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> has taken regarding the inquiry and regarding airport and airline security.''

<TEXT>
 The engineer who proposed Voyager 2's `` grand tour'' 24 years ago as an intern at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is returning there Thursday to view the flight past <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Flandro </PERSON>, now a professor of mechanical engineering at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>, was a graduate student at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in 1965 when he calculated flight paths for interplanetary space probes. Those projections became a central part of the eventual flight paths and launch dates used by Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, which were launched in the 1970s. Flandro found that by using the gravitational fields of the planets to redirect the spacecraft and `` slingshot'' it toward the next planet, the speed and distance traveled by the probes could be dramatically increased. `` At the time, it was thought that if you needed to get to <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, it would be a 40-year flight time,'' he said. `` Using rocket motors to gain that kind of energy is very costly.'' The gravity-boost idea is n't new, he said. `` The early astronomers knew that a comet's energy changes dramatically when it passes close to a planet.'' <PERSON> Flandro </PERSON> will be a guest at the <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> laboratory Thursday as former co-workers and friends celebrate and watch Voyager 2 on TV screens as it comes within 3,000 miles of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. The craft already has passed by <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. After leaving <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> will continue into deep space, relaying pictures and information until its nuclear-powered generator runs out of fuel in about three decades. `` I found that in the early 1980s all of the outer planets would be on the same side of the sun and aligned so that a space vehicle could efficiently visit each one,'' he said. This alignment only happens every 170 years. He gave his idea the name it still uses, the `` grand tour'' concept. `` I did get it started and did the initial selling to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, but it's really the <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propulsion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lab </ORGANIZATION>'s engineers that made it work,'' he said. Voyager 2 has traveled nearly 4.5 billion miles since it was launched by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in 1977, using a launch date that almost exactly matched the one <PERSON> Flandro </PERSON> had calculated 12 years earlier. He said Jupiter, by far the largest planet in the solar system, was the key to the `` grand tour'' plan because of its huge gravitational field. Many of his <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> colleagues doubted him when he first proposed the idea because it was thought that any energy a spacecraft gains as it approaches a planet it would give up as it leaves. The exchange of energy takes place at various times during both the spacecraft's approach and departure, <PERSON> Flandro </PERSON> said, but <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> will have substantially more kinetic energy when it leaves than when it arrived. `` The energy is not free,'' he said. `` Jupiter loses a little bit of its energy as the spacecraft speeds up, but <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> is so large that it does n't make much difference.'' Still, he said, there was a group of people who organized a protest against the initial plan because they thought Jupiter would fall out of its orbit. `` They called themselves the <ORGANIZATION> Pasadena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for the Preservation of <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s Orbit, but I guess no one took them seriously.''

<HEAD>Police Accept Alibi Of `Suspect' For First Set of Serial Killings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The man who had been dubbed a `` viable suspect'' in the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killings was out of town when the series of murders of prostitutes began, authorities said. An investigator said Monday that a task force had confirmed an alibi offered by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, apparently clearing the onetime law student of at least the first four of the 40 or more serial murders linked to the mysterious killer. King County Police Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of the task force, said <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was apparently vacationing on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> during July 1982, when the first victims were killed. His comments were reported in today's editions of The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and were confirmed by his spokesperson, <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>. `` He's still considered a ` person of interest.' He is not being dropped,'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said today. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' family called a news conference in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> last week and produced credit card receipts and photographs to document a family vacation they said proved <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was not in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area when the first murders occurred. Police have attributed the killings of 40 young women in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, areas, to one or more killers. The women disappeared during 1982 through 1984. The case takes its name from the south <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> river </LOCATION> where the first victims were found. Police say at least 40 and possibly as many as 48 murders are involved in the nation's worst unsolved serial murder case. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said the investigation of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> would continue. `` This means we appear to have verified one piece of the equation,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` We will continue our work until we're satisfied he has no involvement in any unsolved crimes in <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Gonzaga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> student, is serving time in the King County Jail in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> for a 1981 escape from work release after a conviction for possessing stolen property. He is scheduled for release Sept. 25. He was identified as a `` viable suspect'' in an affidavit used last month to obtain a search warrant of two <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> residences where he lived. That search yielded 1,800 videotapes, police uniforms and extensive credit card records. Since the search, investigators have referred to <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> as a `` person of interest.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> has not been arrested or charged in connection with the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killkngs. He issued a statement through his attorney denying his involvement.

 Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that Dr. <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilensky </PERSON>, a health policy analyst who has advised <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on medical issues, is the top candidate to head the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid health care programs. The White House is considering <PERSON> Wilensky </PERSON>, who has the backing of <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, and could formally announce her nomination soon if she clears background checks, said the officials, who requested anonymity. <PERSON> Wilensky </PERSON> said Tuesday that she is undergoing a background check by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. If President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nominates her, she said, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearings could be held in late October or early November. If approved, <PERSON> Wilensky </PERSON> would become chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the $ 130 billion Medicare and Medicaid programs. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> provides health care for the elderly while Medicaid helps finance medical services for the poor. <PERSON> Wilensky </PERSON>, 46, is a vice president of Project Hope, a foundation in <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, that trains medical workers and provides emergency care in poor nations and analyzes health issues in this country and abroad. In a telephone interview, she declined to discuss her views on several topics, such as whether federal assistance for abortions should be limited. She said it would be `` premature'' for her to make policy statements. But she said she believes her views would not anger conservative Republicans in the administration or in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, who have blocked prior would-be appointees favored by <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. `` As best as I can tell, and I've asked around to try to get a sense, there is not any opposition to my nomination,'' said <PERSON> Wilensky </PERSON>, a Republican. She advised the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last year when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> extended Medicare to cover the costs of lengthy, serious illnesses of the elderly. Several senior citizen groups have complained that the program is too expensive, and lawmakers are now considering rolling it back. She has provided advice to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on problems of the elderly and of people without medical insurance, escalating health care costs and other issues. <PERSON> Wilensky </PERSON>, who has a doctorate in economics from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, said she has published about 60 studies on medical issues. One of them was a 1982 report that concluded that the government spends as much on health care for the poor as for the well-to-do, when tax breaks for health insurance and medical payments are factored in. <PERSON> Wilensky </PERSON> would be the third person chosen for the job since the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration took office. <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, chief of staff to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., withdrew from consideration in April Her husband is vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> insurance group, which handles <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> claims under contract to HHS. Sources said there were fears of a potential conflict of interest. Last month <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> human services commissioner, decided not to seek the job after drawing opposition from conservative Republicans. In June, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the welfare program, was withdrawn after conservatives expressed opposition.

Fugnido is one of four camps run by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees that house more than 300,000 Sudanese who fled famine and civil war in their country. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, a 44-year-old <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat, was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger. Searchers found the crash site a week later. Retrieval of the bodies from the mountainside, and identification, took nearly another week. At the memorial service in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> was eulogized by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> officials as a man of compassion. `` The fact that he met his tragic death while on a humanitarian mission is ample testimony of his dedication to the well-being of people,'' said <PERSON> Tesfaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolde-Selassie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s interior minister. Work at the aiport stopped and employees joined <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> officials, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy staff and relatives of Ethiopian victims for the ceremony. The Ethiopians wailed in grief and sympathy. <PERSON> Albert-Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, representative in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugee agency, said <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> had died for a `` noble cause.'' It was the congressman's fifth visit to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and his second this year. The sky was clear for Tuesday's ceremony, a contrast to the rain and heavy overcast of the day <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s party took off for the camp. The bad weather is believed to have had a role in the crash. A guard of honor accompanied the coffins of all 16 victims, and a military band played solemn music as they were moved from the makeshift clinic where the bodies were identified. When the ceremony was over, the band played the two national anthems. The coffins of the Americans were taken to the aircraft, and those of the Ethiopians to hearses. The other Americans killed were: _ <PERSON> Patrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 35, a Leland aide. _ <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 34, of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger. _ <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillem </PERSON>, 33, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> lawyer and friend of <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> who was investigating prospects for food-relief projects he had proposed for <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. _ <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Francine </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 39, an aide to Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., and an expert on child health and nutrition issues _ <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, age unavailable, a political and economic officer with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. _ <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, 43, special projects officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. _ <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Worrick </PERSON>, 48, deputy AID representative in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. _ <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Worrick </PERSON>, 48, wife of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Worrick </PERSON> and a contract employee of the AID mission.

 <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, whose Black Panthers preached `` the power of the gun'' in a war against white authority in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, was found fatally shot in an <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> street early today, police reported. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, 47, whose violent career was marked by many clashes with the law and who spent time as a fugitive in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, was found about 5:30 a.m., said police officer <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. A 10-foot-round pool of blood marked the spot in a low-income neighborhood of west <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was found suffering from multiple gunshot wounds, including at least one shot in the head. Police got a report of gunshots fired at 5:29 a.m. and arrived a minute later, said Sgt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcado </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was taken to <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he was pronounced dead at 6:12 a.m. <PERSON> Marcado </PERSON> declined to say whether there were any suspects, or reveal any further details surrounding the fatal shooting. `` I saw him laying down on the street. I called my wife to the window,'' said a resident of the neighborhood, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. He said he did not hear any gunshots and did not call the police. Another resident, who asked not to be identified, said: `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> -RRB- had n't been down here in years. This is where he used to organize. This is really his old stomping grounds.'' <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Seale </PERSON> founded the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION>, the now-defunct radical black liberation group, in the 1960s in reaction to police brutality in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> served as its defense minister. Panthers walked the streets in black berets and black leather jackets to `` protect'' black people from the authorities they reviled as `` pigs.'' <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Rush </PERSON>, a former leader of the Panthers who is now an alderman in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said: `` The Huey that I remember was a student of the world and made a commitment to change the conditions in the world.'' He `` made a contribution to the advancement of the ideals of freedom, justice and equality for all Americans,'' said <PERSON> Rush </PERSON>, who left the <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> nearly 20 years ago. But <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Orloff </PERSON>, deputy district attorney for <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> who prosecuted <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> in 1974, called him `` a man who lived by violence and outside the law'' and `` nothing but a gangster.'' A Black Panther party poster distributed nationally during the organization's heyday pictured <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> on an African wicker throne bearing a shotgun and a spear. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on un-American activities said in August 1970 that the Black Panthers were controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to `` serve as shock troops on the front line of the revolution.'' Then-FBI chief <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> described the <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> as a `` black extremist organization'' consisting mostly of `` hoodlum-type revolutionaries'' who stockpiled weapons, espoused Marxist-Leninist doctrines and terrorized black communities. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, in turn, once commented in an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> interview: `` The most dangerous groups to the people of the world are the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, including the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military, the local police, the avaricious businessmen and the lying politicians. All are guilty of crimes against the people and the verdict is death.'' Nine years ago, he donned a cap and gown to receive a doctor of philosophy degree at age 38 from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>. His dissertation was titled: `` War against the <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION>, a study of repression in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' But his life was marked by repeated clashes with the law. He was convicted of manslaughter for the shooting death of an <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> policeman on Oct. 28, 1967, and was sentenced to 2 to 15 years. But that conviction was overturned on appeal after he served two years in prison. The charge was dropped after two retrials ended in hung juries. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in 1964, was convicted of being a felon in possession of weapons after a 1974 incident in which he allegedly pistol-whipped his tailor and police found two guns in his apartment. He then fled the country and lived for three years in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. He was acquitted of a charge of assault in connection with the incident. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Orloff </PERSON>, deputy district attorney for <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> who prosecuted <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> in the 1974 case, called him `` a man who lived by violence and outside the law'' and `` nothing but a gangster.'' Earlier this year, <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> drew six months in jail after pleading no contest to misappropriating $ 15,000 in public money earmarked for a school the <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> ran in the early 1980s. He was already in jail at the time for parole violation. The Panthers eventually died out because of infighting, arrests, deaths, imprisonments and differing philosophies, especially between <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleaver </PERSON>, the one-time Panther information minister and author of `` Soul on Ice'' who fled the country for several years in the 1960s after a shootout between Panthers and police.

<TEXT>
 Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, a centrist who has lost ground recently to reformists, suggested in an interview published Tuesday that he will step down to prevent a power struggle. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> did not specifically say he would resign, but the official <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported that he did not contradict a reporter for the party daily <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION> who asked `` why he intended to leave the political scene.'' `` Many people want to believe that the main cause of the current problems is the power struggle within the party,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` I would not like to have a power struggle, as it would not do any good to either the party or the country.'' He did not elaborate, either on his political future or his views on the party conflict. But he apparently was alluding to expectations that an extraordinary party congress Oct. 6 would be dominated by a battle between reformers and their opponents. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> became general secretary of the party 15 months ago, replacing <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, the leader of 32 years who had become associated with political and economic stagnation. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> assumed power amid expectations he would head reforms while maintaining discipline and good terms with party conservatives. But he was left behind as reformers forced the pace of political and economic liberalization. In the past two years, the surge of reformist sentiment within the party has led to the endorsement of a multiparty system and of free elections, by mid-1990 at the latest. A draft manifesto published in <LOCATION> Nepszabadsag </LOCATION> on Friday, ahead of the special party congress scheduled for Oct. 6, reiterated the communists' intention to `` introduce a multiparty system, in which the source of power is the will of the people manifested in free elections.'' The reformers formally consolidated strength in June, when three of them were appointed to share power with <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>. The shakeup placed reform economist <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> in the new post of party chairman, a position he has described as `` first among equals.'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> had been a scheduled speaker at a party rally honoring St. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>, the 11th century king who founded the Hungarian nation. But he was absent. Party official Pal <PERSON> Ivany </PERSON> said at the rally that <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> was planning to resign. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> already told the independent daily <PERSON> Mai </PERSON> <PERSON> Nap </PERSON> in June he planned to step down after the elections, but he told <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION> it was up to the party to decide whether he would step down.

<HEAD>Baltics Call Soviet Annexation a `Crime,' Equate Hitler, Stalin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Baltic residents Tuesday mourned the loss of their independence a half-century ago as an `` international crime'' that must be swept aside by a tide of reform, and they vilified <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> as `` monsters of the 20th century.'' About 50,000 people gathered in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a treaty between <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that brought Soviet tanks rolling into <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. Baltic residents plan to mark the anniversary of the 1939 agreement on Wednesday with a human chain stretching 370 miles from <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, on the Gulf of <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, to the Polish-Lithuanian border. Activists predict 1.5 million people will join it. A Lithuanian legislative commission in a report published Tuesday declared that `` the realization of the illegal German-Soviet agreements of 1939-41 constitute an international crime.'' Grassroots activists issued a statement in <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, demanding the absorption of the republics be recognized both inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and internationally as an act of aggression. Commemoration of the anniversary in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION>, as well as other regions such as the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>, illustrated the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s dilemna dealing with ethnic minorities clamoring for greater freedom. Soviets now more than ever are free to criticize <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, but an official finding that annexation of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> was illegal would raise the question of total independence. Showing the power that independence movements have accumulated in the Baltic governments, the commission of the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet declared that approving annexation was beyond the powers of the Lithuanian parliament of the time and `` absolutely against the will of the citizens of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>.'' The report will be forwarded to the full Supreme Soviet in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> organization of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, said it may eventually form the basis for a republic-wide referendum on future relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. A representative of a Russian cultural organization in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> told the rally that <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, `` two monsters of the 20th century, personally ruined the fate of millions of people.'' <PERSON> Vytautas </PERSON> <PERSON> Landsbergis </PERSON>, leader of the <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sajudis </LOCATION>, or People's Front movement, told the <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> rally that annulment of the pact is `` not only a historic and political question but a moral one of the liquidation of Stalinism.'' <PERSON> Landsbergis </PERSON> spoke as several dozen yellow, red and green Lithuanian national flags fluttered. Youths climbed light towers to get a better view of the stage and children were hoisted on their parents' shoulders. After the Soviets seized control, thousands of Baltic residents were shot or deported for their anti-Soviet sympathies. After the war, others were similarly punished for real or alleged collaboration with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. Baltic residents increasingly have come to equate the actions of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, who divided <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> into spheres of influence on the eve of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s attack on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> the started World War II. Posters in the <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> crowd showed a skull and crossbones imposed over the Soviet and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> flags. The official Soviet media struggled against that impression in two reports from <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> criticizing a new monument to an Estonian pro-Nazi group and cards showing a hammer and sickle and swastika together. Recalling the Soviet struggle to turn back <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s invasion, the national daily <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said, `` No one has the right to spit on our graves.'' In a statement released at a conference of East European activists in <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, leaders of the grassroots <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> organizations of the Baltic republics said that in the years since it annexed them, `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has done everything to remove the republics of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> from the memory and the map of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, from your libraries and textbooks, your sense of justice, your grief and your minds. `` Let us unite our voices to demand that the <LOCATION> Hitler-Stalin </LOCATION> pacts together with their secret protocols be declared null and void from the very moment of their signing! Let us declare the annexation of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> unlawful,'' it said. A two-day conference of Eastern <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> activists that wrapped up Tuesday in <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> called for an `` end to the occupation of the Baltic states'' and asked <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries to seek <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> action declaring it an act of aggression. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for decades denied the existence of a secret protocol to the Aug. 23, 1939, non-aggression treaty that divided <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> into spheres of influence. A commission of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> national parliament in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is investigating the pact and has said it should be declared `` null and void.'' But it stopped short of criticizing the incorporation of the then-independent Baltic states into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Communist Party Politburo member <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, in an interview with the party newspaper Pravda, said last week there was there was no connection between the division of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the incorporation of the Baltic republics. <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> is a close adviser to President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the party's chief ideologist. He also is chairman of the national commission on the Stalin-Hitler agreement.

 A federal judge on Tuesday ordered disbarred attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Borders </PERSON> to jail for refusing to answer questions from a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel gathering evidence in the <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> impeachment trial. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> found Borders in contempt of court and gave him until 10 a.m. Friday to put his affairs in order and surrender to federal marshals. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> acted hours after Borders refused for the third time in a month to answer questions posed by the <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> impeachment committee. The committee is gathering evidence concerning charges that <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, a 52-year-old <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district judge from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, conspired with Borders to obtain a $ 150,000 payoff and lied about it before a jury that acquitted him in 1983. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who was impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in August 1988, is also accused of improperly disclosing information that government investigators obtained through a court-approved wiretap. Once the committee finishes its report, the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will vote on whether to remove <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> from the federal bench and thus take away the $ 89,500 annual salary he continues to collect. While <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was acquitted by a federal court jury, Borders was convicted of the payoff conspiracy charges in 1982. He was disbarred, sent to prison for 33 months and shorn of the political influence officials say he wielded in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of the late 1970s. At the request of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> held Borders in civil contempt of court for refusing to testify after being granted immunity from prosecution for anything concerning the payoff plot that he might say in the proceeding. `` This court ... confines him to the custody of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal until he purges himself,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Borders could win his release whenever he wished, simply by answering questions from the committee. If he remains silent, however, he will remain behind bars until the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes on whether to remove <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> from the bench, most likely before mid-October. Borders on Tuesday refused to answer 10 questions posed by Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa. They ranged from whether <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> received any payoff money to the reported relationship between Borders and the late <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Mafia boss <ORGANIZATION> Santo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trafficante </ORGANIZATION>. In reply to each of the questions, Borders cited a statement he read to the panel July 27, when he had remained similarly silent. In it, he refused to answer questions on grounds that they violated his constitutional rights, including his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination. Borders was arrested in October 1981 when he drove out of a suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> motel with a garment bag containing $ 125,000 in cash and accompanied by a retired <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent masquerading as a convicted racketeer in quest of leniency from <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>.

 Israeli troops fatally shot a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> woman Tuesday in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and two other Arabs were reported killed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, raising to six the number of Palestinian deaths in the past two days. Also Tuesday, a group of prominent Palestinians met with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> legislators in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> despite warnings from underground leaders of the uprising not to do so. The rash of fatalities in the occupied lands prompted commercial strikes in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as well as in the Palestinian towns of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> to the north and <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> to the south. Palestinian school officials said the army told them the violence also would delay the reopening of classes for high school sophomores and juniors. Teachers earlier were told the classes would resume Wednesday. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools were closed for most of the uprising, but have been reopened in phases since July. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, 20-year-old <PERSON> Maha </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadath </PERSON> was killed by a stray shot when a clash erupted between soldiers and masked, stone-throwing youths in the market of the <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Balah </PERSON> refugee camp, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said. Doctors at <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said she was hit in the head by a rubber-coated metal pellet that troops use for riot control. A military spokeswoman confirmed the death and said the army was investigating the two other reported deaths. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, 14-year-old <PERSON> Najla </PERSON> <PERSON> Aadel </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Nadi </PERSON> died of a bullet wound to the head suffered during a stone-throwing confrontation with soldiers a week ago in the Askar refugee camp near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, according to doctors at <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Al-Amari </PERSON> refugee camp, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said the body of <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahin </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Katrina </PERSON>, 17, was found Tuesday with a bullet wound in his chest. Residents said troops opened fire during clashes in the camp Monday night, but the army spokesman's office said it could not confirm if there was any shooting. Reporters were banned from entering the camp because of a curfew confining residents to their homes. The deaths raised to at least 545 the number of Palestinians killed since the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule began in December 1987. Thirty-eight Israelis also have died in the violence. Palestinians have killed 97 fellow Arabs, many suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities. The death in <PERSON> Al-Amari </PERSON> camp was the second mysterious killing in the area north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in a week. On Friday, the body of a Palestinian-American boy was found near <LOCATION> El-Bireh </LOCATION>, adjacent to <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. He had been shot at close range in the chest. The family alleged that the boy, 14-year-old <PERSON> Amjad </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, was in army custody before his death and that the body showed signs of beating and torture. The army exhumed <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON>'s body for an autopsy and announced Monday that his death `` was not caused by Israeli security forces.'' It did not say who killed him. Dr. <PERSON> Derick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pounder </PERSON>, a Scottish pathologist brought in by the <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON> family to conduct an independent autopsy, said Tuesday he was unable to do so immediately because of `` bureaucratic problems'' with Israeli authorities. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, Palestinians met with lawmakers from the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. Labor member <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Peretz </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that some Gazans scheduled to attend the meeting stayed away, apparently because of unwillingness to meet with Israelis in the ruling parties. `` This meeting is not considered disobedience of the orders of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uprising </ORGANIZATION>,'' <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaaban </PERSON> told reporters. `` We met with people that have no authority.'' The latest leaflet from the underground leadership last week warned that Palestinians should `` reject meetings with any <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION>, official or unofficial.'' <PERSON> Peretz </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that the meeting was part of ongoing efforts to discuss human rights problems in the territories and to review options for advancing the government's peace plan. The plan calls for elections in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to choose local Palestinians to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on limited autonomy for the territories.

 Voyager 2's encounter with <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> caps a string of successes for an aging but still nimble spacecraft that was supposed to have been abandoned years ago. Voyager 2 was launched on Aug. 20, 1977, on a five-year mission to explore two new worlds: Jupiter and Saturn. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> scientists knew, however, that if the spacecraft held out it could theoretically go on to Uranus and <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, which were in precisely the right alignment. That happens only once every 175 years. Twelve years after its launch, Voyager 2 is almost 3 billion miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and about to pass 3,000 miles from <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, its closest approach to any object in the solar system since leaving Earth. Voyager 1, launched Sept. 5, 1977, passed <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> on a course that then took it out of the solar system. The two Voyager spacecraft encountered Jupiter in 1979. The biggest surprise was the discovery of at least nine active volcanoes on <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io. Eruptions spewed material up to 190 miles above the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>'s surface. A thin ring was discovered around Jupiter, and the identification of three new moons brought <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s total to at least 16. The two spacecraft passed <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 and 1981. <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>'s rings, which had seemed simple and distinct from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, were revealed to be a nearly continuous layer of complex rings One was delicately braided from three strands of material. Wind on Saturn was observed at staggering speeds of up to 1,100 mph. Saturn was known before the encounters to have 11 moons. It is now known to have at least 17. As Voyager 2 continued alone to Uranus, it discovered that the planet had a strange magnetic field with a corkscrew-shaped tail extending millions of miles into space. Uranus's moon <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> was shown to have been dramatically fractured by internal forces, a finding that researchers have still not explained. Ten new moons were found, bringing the total to 15. Voyager found two new rings around Uranus, in addition to the nine previously known. A high layer of smog was found over the south pole, which was in direct sunlight. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 took more than 100,000 pictures of Jupiter and <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>, and Voyager 2 sent back 7,000 pictures from Uranus.

<HEAD>Beatles Tapes Flop at Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three tapes recorded by the Beatles were snubbed by bidders Tuesday, although <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s sunglasses and a pair of high heels worn by <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> in `` Some Like It Hot'' fetched higher-than-expected prices. Two other tapes, in which the Fab Four sang and read from the Bible, were sold for about $ 18,700 to a private German buyer who bid by telephone. The auctioneer, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, had set minimum prices of $ 16,000 each for two of the unsold tapes and a minimum of $ 24,000 for the third. The disappointed owner of the tapes, former Beatles' chauffeur <PERSON> Alf </PERSON> <PERSON> Bicknell </PERSON>, said he may put them back in the tool shed where they were kept since 1966. `` We were expecting about 50,000 pounds -LRB- $ 80,000 -RRB- more coming from the Beatles' tapes,'' said <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s spokeswoman <PERSON> Susu </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> said the auction house was required to read a statement from the <ORGANIZATION> Beatles </ORGANIZATION>' record company, <ORGANIZATION> EMI </ORGANIZATION>, before the tapes were auctioned that warned buyers they would not be able to broadcast or sell copies. `` Perhaps that put people off,'' she said. <PERSON> Bicknell </PERSON>, the Beatles' chauffeur from 1964-66, said <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> gave him the reel-to-reel tapes in 1966, thinking they had been sent by fans. The tapes had been in <PERSON> Bicknell </PERSON>'s tool shed in <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> until last year when, in the course of writing a book about the Beatles, he listened to them and found that the group had made the tapes on a portable machine. <PERSON> Bicknell </PERSON>, 60, sat out the sale at a nearby pub because he was too nervous to watch. He said he was selling the tapes because he has had some lean years while writing the book `` Baby You Can Drive My Car,'' co-authored by <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> of <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> and the Pacemakers, another <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> band. A Puerto Rican collector, who gave his name only as <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, paid $ 8,800 for the 4 -LCB- - inch black Ferragamo heels worn by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> in `` Some Like It Hot. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Trees </PERSON>, from northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, successfully bid $ 3,000 for <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s black jacket. `` I would have paid 2,750 pounds -LRB- $ 4,400 -RRB-,'' said the director of a nursing home company who sports an eight-inch tattoo of <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s single `` Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting'' cover on his right arm. <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s sunglasses sold for $ 3,500. It was standing room only at Tuesday's memorabilia sale of 536 items. The gallery held a mixed crowd of heavy metal fans with shaved heads wearing all black, 1960s survivors in bright patterns and the conservative coiffed crowd which frequents Bond St. where Sotheby's is located. The auction netted $ 364,000, compared with 1987's rock memorabilia sale that brought in $ 360,000. Last year <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s held an Elton <PERSON> John </PERSON> sale, instead of the rock' n' roll memorabilia sale, which made $ 8 million.

<HEAD>Investigation Finds Problems, No Specific Cause of Iowa Blast</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> report on the blast aboard the USS Iowa that claimed 47 lives will not pinpoint a specific reason for the explosion but will cite `` a probability'' about its cause, defense sources say. One defense official said investigators have attempted to look at all the circumstances that may have led to the explosion, but that none appears to have been the overriding reason for the disaster. The official said he was told the report will show a number of `` lapses in procedures,'' but he declined to define them specifically. Asked about reports that such problems as lapses in preventative maintenance of the gun turret had been uncovered, or that some of the sailors had not been properly certified to operate the ship's complex firing mechanism, the official said: `` The investigation found various things wrong about procedures But none of them has been found to be the cause.'' `` The report cites a probability,'' said the official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. The long-awaited report _ said to fill three feet of a file drawer _ is under study by the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>, at the Pentagon. <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> is expected to brief <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> before he releases it to the public. Both officials are traveling and will not return to the Pentagon until next week. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators have worked for months to find the cause of the April 19 tragedy, when powder exploded in the battleship's No. 2 gun turret during open seas gunnery practice near <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Although <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has said the report is expected to be made public at the end of August or the beginning of September, it now appears that a September release appears more likely, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> source said. `` They're poring over everything with a magnifying glass,'' the official said. `` In any investigation of this magnitude, they have to look at everything.'' Another Pentagon official familiar with the type of study that has been undertaken said it is very difficult to find a specific reason when so many have been killed who might have offered a clue to the blast. There were 11 survivors inside the turret, which extended six decks down into the ship. The survivors were all on the lowest deck loading power from the ship's magazines at the time of the blast. Besides delving into the mechanical problems that could have caused the blast, it researches the possibility that human action may have been the reason for the explosion. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Tuesday's editions that the investigation has found the crew failed to perform certain unspecified preventive maintenance procedures, but the newspaper added it is not known whether the faulty maintenance caused the explosion. The Post reported the No. 2 turret's guns passed pre-firing checks before the explosion. In a separate story, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, reported that the sailors who worked with the explosives in the turret had not been properly cleared to man their posts. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> requires that all who work at certain posts be certified by a qualifying board, which determines whether they are able to handle weapons or other procedures. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Drowns </PERSON>, one of 11 sailors who escaped the explosion, told the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> a qualification board was never convened on the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> during his three years on the ship. Another <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> survivor, Gunner's Mate 3rd Class <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, has said one of the sailors who lacked a qualification book showing facts about the guns was Gunner's Mate 3rd Class <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Backherms </PERSON>, the rammerman of the center gun where the explosion occurred. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Backherms </PERSON> joined the ship shortly after Christmas, was inexperienced and may have caused the blasts by ramming the bags of explosives into the gun too fast.

 Two people pleaded innocent Tuesday to charges they conspired to supply the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> with weapons, including anti-helicopter rockets. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, 27, an Irish citizen, to continue to be held without bail. <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, who lived in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, has no family in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, no job and only has a vistor's visa. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, pleaded innocent to charges they conspired to violate federal arms export control laws and regulations. <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> allowed Ms. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> to remain free on a $ 10,000 signature bond, but restricted her travel to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> are among five people indicted earlier this month.

 A committee of African leaders on Tuesday asked President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> Sese Seko of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> to try to put faltering Angolan peace efforts back on track. The special eight-member peace committee on <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> also called for <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> to work toward mediating an end to military operations by the rebel Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 An escalating Sinhalese uprising took at least 61 more lives, and the government arrested 100 suspected radicals, officials and independent sources said Tuesday. At least 18 bodies were found Monday in the central village of <LOCATION> Mahawehera </LOCATION>, where ethnic Sinhalese radicals ambushed a military convoy the previous day, said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. The bodies were dumped in a roadside ditch formed by buried explosives that were detonated under the passing convoy, the sources said. The attack killed at least six soldiers and a civilian driver. The sources said the bodies were of suspected radicals killed by government forces in revenge for Sunday's attack. They said the suspects had been shot. Government officials said they knew of no retaliatory violence in <LOCATION> Mahawehera </LOCATION>, 85 miles northeast of the capital of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. However, senior government officials have in the past acknowledged privately that members of the security forces sometimes commit abuses in trying to halt the radicals' campaign of killing and terror. At least 10 other bodies were found near the village of <LOCATION> Atturugiriya </LOCATION>, 15 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, said police officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. There were no details on how the victims died. The bodies were burned and could not be identified, police said. Human rights groups have blamed most of such killings on government forces and pro-government vigilante groups that support the official campaign to put down the uprising. In other violence reported since Monday, at least 11 radicals and two policemen were killed in three separate shootouts in the Sinhalese-dominated south and center of the island, military sources said. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 100 suspected Sinhalese radicals were arrested during the same period. At least 4,000 people have been killed in the Sinhalese campaign launched in July 1987 to protest government peace overtures to rebels from the minority ethnic Tamil community. The radicals say a peace plan aimed at ending the rebellion gave too many concessions to the Tamils. They also say the deployment of Indian soldiers in the Tamil-dominated north and east to enforce the plan compromises <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s sovereignty. Military officials also said 20 relatives of soldiers and police officers were killed Monday and Tuesday by Sinhalese radicals. The killings are follow threats against relatives of those soldiers and police officers who refuse to heed a call from the radicals to resign. The deadline for the ultimatum expired Sunday, said the officials, who can not be identified under briefing rules. At least 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have been killed since Tamils launched their separatist war in 1983. Indian diplomats said Indian soldiers killed five Tamil rebels Monday. The Tamils say they suffer discrimination by the Sinhalese majority. Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, form 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. The Buddhist Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population.

 The rebound in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> feed grain production this year will help lower feed costs and stimulate use, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said Tuesday. Total output of feed grains _ corn, sorghum, barley and oats _ for 1989 was estimated at 217.6 million metric tons, based on Aug. 1 production estimates announced earlier this month. That is up 46 percent from last year's drought-reduced harvest of 149.2 million tons. Part of the increase is due to a 14 percent boost in harvested acreage. But total feed use in 1989-90 is expected to be about 226 million tons, up 5 million tons from the 1988-89 forecast. Domestic feeding is forecast to increase by almost 9 million tons, but exports may drop because of greater foreign competition. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn. The department uses metric tons to measure overall feed supplies and use, and bushels when referring to specific grains. `` With use likely to exceed production, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks -LRB- in 1989-90 -RRB- may drop more than a tenth,'' the report said. `` However, prices are also expected to decline because of lower loan rates and reduced drought psychology in the market.'' World production of coarse grains such as corn is projected at 800 million tons, up 10 percent from 1988-89, the report said. That includes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> output. `` While -LRB- total -RRB- foreign production may be nearly unchanged, significant increases are expected in the major competing exporters, except for the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' it said. `` A tightening in the world coarse grain supply-use situation appears likely in 1989-90.'' The report said world feed grains consumption is expected to increase in 1989-90, exceeding production for the third straight year. In a related government report, the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> said its weekly survey for Aug. 14-20 showed that the nation's corn crop was `` in good to fair condition'' and that 68 percent of the acreage was in the dough stage of kernel development or beyond. An estimated 26 percent of the corn was in the final dent stage of kernel development. Both the dough and dent stages are lagging the usual pace for corn development in most of the major production states, the report said. The facility, which is operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> departments </ORGANIZATION>, reports on weather and crop conditions during the season. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will issue the next production estimate on Sept. 12.

 <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, the booming resort that grew from <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s fund-raising talents, hangs on in the shadow of its glory days, before the TV evangelist resigned and was indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges. The Heritage Grand Hotel and the sprawling water park remain open. They are bordered by the half-finished spectres of a 20-story hotel and the fiberglass turrets and towers of a hamburger castle. There's no longer enough traffic to wear down the grass that pops through the concrete of the massive parking lot at the water park. A giant crane looms over the unfinished hotel, shadowing the shops of <LOCATION> Main </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION>'s indoor shopping mall. `` Used to be, you could n't even get a seat in here,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Daneilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Turlock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, as he watched a handful of shoppers drift along Main Street. `` Whenever a service would let out or something else was going on, you could forget about getting into the ice cream shop over there.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> envisioned <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> as a retreat for Christians that would feature family entertainment and religious services. Now it's owned by a Canadian developer and <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> goes on trial Monday. Prosecutors say he and other <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executives used at least $ 4 million of the $ 158 million they raised through `` lifetime partnerships'' in the ministry to pay for their own luxurious lifestyles. <PERSON> Danielson </PERSON> was one of those who donated at least $ 1,000 to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> for a partnership in 1984 in exchange for three nights lodging a year at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> for the rest of his life. Several hotels were proposed, but the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> was the only one finished and opened. <PERSON> Danielson </PERSON> soon switched his partnership from the uncompleted towers to the Heritage Grand Hotel. The switch meant he got to use his partnership, unlike many others. `` I felt like I got my money's worth out of it,'' said <PERSON> Danielson </PERSON>. `` I switched that first year and then came at least two more years. With rooms running $ 90 or $ 100 a night, it worked out about even.'' <PERSON> Danielson </PERSON> said he had not been to <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> in a couple of years, and he could immediately see a difference. `` All the limousines are gone from the front of the hotel,'' he said. `` They used to be all over the place out here. Every day we'd see <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> pull in with his limousine and chauffeur. The <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' likenesses are virtually absent from the shops along Main Street. A small table in the Victor Music Shoppe held books written by <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, which were once used as premiums for faithful contributors. Tuesday, they were on sale at 75 percent off the retail price. Records by <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> and her daughter, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, were selling for as little as 98 cents. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, who owns a snack bar on Main Street, saw the end of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s heyday. `` I got this just two weeks before it all started to unravel,'' <PERSON> Cantu </PERSON> said, referring to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s resignation in March 1987. `` It's been kind of tough.'' <PERSON> Cantu </PERSON> said the former owners, who also operated the ice cream shop and popcorn stand, did $ 10,000 worth of business on a Fourth of July four or five years ago. `` Ten thousand dollars in a single day, can you believe it?'' asked <PERSON> Cantu </PERSON>, who lives on the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> grounds and also works as an evangelist helping refugees from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` That's how busy it used to be around here,'' he said. `` There were so many people you could hardly move. `` Now, it's OK on weekends, but hardly anybody during the week,'' he said. `` There's a healing conference going on this week, so you have maybe 40, 50, 60 people here for that. That's helped pick it up a little, but it's not like it was. `` And I honestly doubt if it ever will be again.''

<HEAD>Police Believe 57 Perished in Pleasure Boat Sinking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police believe 57 people perished in the sinking of a pleasure boat on the <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION>, authorities said Tuesday as inquests began into the worst accident on the river in this century. The 90-ton Marchioness, carrying revelers on a late-night party cruise, sank after being hit by the 1,475-ton sand-and-gravel dredger Bowbelle near <LOCATION> Southwark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Among the victims identified Tuesday was 28-year-old <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Tremain </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and later a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> resident. New safety regulations announced following Sunday's sinking took effect Tuesday. Captains now must leave ashore a record of passenger totals before setting sail and must give airline-style safety instructions to passengers. `` Seventy-nine survived and 57 are now believed to have been lost,'' said a spokeswoman from <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. Police said 31 bodies were recovered and 26 people were missing. Police Detective Chief Superintendent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Purchase </PERSON> testified Tuesday that blood alcohol tests on the Bowbelle's seven crew and the Marchioness' surviving crew member proved negative. The pleasure boat's captain is among the missing. Purchase gave evidence at the opening of an inquest into 16 victims. Under British law the inquest had to open before the victims could be buried. `` We have had some difficulty in discovering exactly how many people were on the vessel. But from my inquiries, I am confident that the certified capacity of that pleasure vessel was not exceeded,'' said Purchase. The Marchioness, hired for the 26th birthday party of a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> financier, was licensed to carry 149 passengers and two crew. Purchase told <PERSON> Westminster </PERSON> <PERSON> Coroner </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapman </PERSON> he hoped to give the Director of Public Prosecutions a report by weekend. The inquest was adjourned until Sept. 20 when other inquiries are expected to be completed. The worst previous accident on the <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> was in 1878, when 700 people died after the Princess <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> paddle steamer was struck by a collier. About 170 people survived the accident. Thames crews based at Westminster Pier, near the Houses of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, decided Tuesday to cancel pleasure boat sailings until the wreckage of the Marchioness is removed, said the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. Pleasure-boat operators had canceled all cruises Monday but some resumed service Tuesday. The Marchioness lay on a sandy bank near the accident site, exposed to view at low tides. The Italian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the bodies of two Italian citizens _ <PERSON> Lino </PERSON> <PERSON> di </PERSON> <PERSON> Girolamo </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Marino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drusetta </LOCATION> _ had been recovered. Among foreign-born victims identified at the Westminster inquest were <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Lim </PERSON>, 25, and <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Plevey </PERSON>, 29, both natives of <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Vida </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamash </PERSON>, 21, born in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. All were <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> residents.

<TEXT>
 An investigation leading to kidnap conspiracy charges against two <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> men began after one contacted an undercover police officer through a computer message system asking about young boys for a pornographic `` snuff'' film, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> affidavit says. The affidavit, filed as part of the case, quoted one of the men as saying his `` main interest'' was in killing the child. It quoted <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Depew </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, as saying, `` I want to strangle the kid, I want to hang the kid, I want to suffocate the kid.'' <PERSON> Depew </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambey </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, were arrested Aug. 14 after a six-month investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, police department. The investigation began in February when a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> police officer, in his investigative work, listed himself in a computer `` bulletin board'' system `` designed to assist people seeking contact with others interested in diverse sexual pursuits,'' the papers said. Over the course of numerous contacts, <PERSON> Lambey </PERSON> told the undercover officer he was interested in making a sexually explicit movie with children, according to the affidavit filed in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. During one telephone conversation with his police officer contact, the affidavit said, <PERSON> Lambey </PERSON> said, `` I think the pleasure of doin' it would be worth it.'' According to the affidavit, at a July 21 meeting at a hotel near <LOCATION> Dulles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Depew </PERSON> said he would accept a boy as young as 12 `` but 13 or 14 is more along my lines.'' More than 100 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents were involved in the investigation, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents from <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> followed them 24 hours a day to make sure no child or citizen was placed in danger,'' the prosecutor said. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> urged parents to keep track of their children. `` There are, as this case illustrates, people out there who choose to prey on children.'' Authorities said that under the scheme they are alleging the men had in mind, a child would abducted or purchased. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> affidavit quoted <PERSON> Lambey </PERSON> as saying he knew someone in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> who would sell a child for $ 12,000. He said $ 5,000 of that amount would be returned if the child were returned, according to the affidavit. During one conversation with agents, <PERSON> Depew </PERSON> said he had previously attempted to molest and kill an American teen-ager in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and a boy from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, who `` looked about 15,'' the affidavit said. Both men are charged with conspiracy to kidnap and were being held Tuesday pending grand jury action.

 He was the picture of revolutionary chic: a spear in one hand, a gun in the other, a black beret posed jauntily on his Afro-blown hair and he on his throne _ a wing-backed wicker patio chair. He was <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>: Black Panther co-founder, Black Panther minister of defense; ex-con, expatriate. He's dead now, like so many others who bought the credo he adopted from <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>: `` Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.'' <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s bullet-riddled body was found in a pool of blood in a poor <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, neighborhood early Tuesday. During the late 1960s and early'70s, the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> put `` pig'' in the national lexicon, and shocked a naive and non-violent generation into the chilling realities of racial warfare. They prowled urban streets in shiny black shoes and black leather jackets, insolent berets and starched blue shirts tucked neatly into pressed black slacks. Their weapons were shotguns, law books and tape recorders. They were out to protect the community. Only the Panthers were n't on the look-out for muggers, rapists and robbers _ they were scoping cops Their self-proclaimed mandate was to prevent police brutality against ghetto blacks, who were sometimes beaten during arrests and whose civil rights were at times violated. `` The Panthers created an image of defiance and organized resistance to police forces that did not take into consideration the rights and basic human dignities of the black community,'' <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Rush </PERSON>, one-time Panther deputy minister of defense and former leader of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> chapter, said in a 1983 interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` A lot of the reform in police departments across the country today is directly related to the heated controversy of Panthers vs. police.'' Rush, now a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> alderman, called it a controversy. Others called it a war, including <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>. Then director of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> `` the most violence-prone of all the extremist groups.'' <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>'s secret war was devastating to the Panther organization. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> launched a secret campaign involving fake documents and letters, infiltrators and informants, which was disclosed by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> investigating committee in 1976. It was part of <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>'s COINTELPRO operation in the'60s and'70s to disrupt and discredit civil rights and anti-war organizations In 1969, Black Panthers <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> were killed in a pre-dawn police raid at their <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> headquarters. Police had ostenstibly been searching for weapons. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>'s relatives, and other survivors of the raid, successfully sued city, state and federal officials and were awarded $ 1.85 million in 1983. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Seale </PERSON>, who helped <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> create the <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> in 1966, once told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> that law officers killed 26 Panthers and that the <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> dispatched their share of police and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents. `` They wounded 60-odd of us, we wounded 32 of them. I think the reason we killed less and wounded less was because they had ... more equipment,'' said <PERSON> Seale </PERSON>, who today writes cookbooks and cooks barbecue, and has a cameo appearance in the movie `` Rude Awakening.'' Initially, the Panthers were non-violent. They appeared at the scene of an arrest merely to observe the police. The police resented their presence, and the non-violent Panther patrols soon led to altercations and eventually shoot-outs. <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleaver </PERSON>, the former Panther minister of information and author of `` Soul on Ice,'' was charged with assaulting a police officer in an <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, gunbattle in 1968. He jumped his $ 50,000 bail and fled to <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. He returned in 1975, saying he had a `` religious conversion.'' He pleaded guilty to the charges, was given probation and ordered to do 2,000 hours of community service. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was released from prison in 1970 after serving almost three years for the 1967 murder of an <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> police officer. The verdict was later overturned because of errors by the trial judge. He also was twice tried for the 1974 slaying of a young prostitute. The charges were dropped after both trials ended in hung juries. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> went into self-exile in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> shortly thereafter. He returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1977. The Panthers, said <PERSON> Seale </PERSON>, never became economically self-sufficient by creating their own businesses and investments. Instead, they relied on donations from white liberal organizations and individuals _ which began to dwindle in the'70s. The Panthers were good at raising money from the captains of industry and culture, such as those who attended `` that party at <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON>'s'' _ the Park Avenue fund-raising bash given by composer-conductor <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> in 1970. Guests included filmmaker <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Preminger </PERSON> and socialite <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Phipps </PERSON>. The take for the Panthers was $ 10,000. `` If business wo n't give us full employment, then we must take the means of production and put them in the hands of the people,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, a Panther field marshal who spoke at the fund-raiser. `` I dig absolutely,'' said <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s counter-intelligence program also helped to shatter the Panthers. <PERSON> Seale </PERSON> and other former Panthers, who eventually wound up in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> congressional offices, civil service jobs and corporate positions, contend that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> infiltrators posing as <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> committed robberies and incited shoot-outs to help undermine the organization. The Panthers had a purge, dropping hundreds of members they thought might be undercover agents. But what the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> counter-intelligence program also did, <PERSON> Seale </PERSON> said, was to stop black organizations from merging. Panther rhetoric, and the fear it caused, also smothered the organization. <PERSON> Seale </PERSON>'s unsuccessful campaign for <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> mayor in 1973 dealt a major blow to Panther ranks. Members from chapters around the country had been called to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to help in the campaign. Disillusioned when he lost, they quit the party. The meager remnants of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> huddled together in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. With <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, party leadership fell to <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> who ran for <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in 1973 and 1975, finishing second both times. Under her leadership, the Panthers instituted a number of community activities, such as shopping assistance for the elderly, a community school for ghetto youngsters, child care and student lunch programs. The school program was closed in 1982 amid allegations that federal and state grants were misused. Today, the Panthers prowl no more. But they left an important legacy, <PERSON> Seale </PERSON> said: `` One thing it did is that it let the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> and other overt racist organizations know that if these young blacks had the audacity to shoot it out with the police, then those groups had a hard way to go.''

 A federal judge denied the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>'s request Tuesday that shrimp fishermen be required to equip their nets with devices designed to protect endangered sea turtles from drowning. Wildlife Federation attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON> said he would appeal the decision by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>. The federation had asked the court to require the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to enforce regulations requiring shrimpers to equip their nets with turtle excluder devices, or TEDs. Five conservation groups, meanwhile, filed suit against <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, alleging his actions on behalf of shimpers have virtually assured the drowning of thousands of endangered sea turtles. In a lawsuit filed late Monday in federal court here, the organizations claim <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> acted unlawfully when he suspended regulations that require shrimpers to use TEDs, which prevent sea turtles from becoming ensnarled in their nets and drowning. The lawsuit also seeks to force <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> to resume enforcement of the suspended regulations on TEDs. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> suspended TEDs regulations after shrimpers, angry about having to use the devices, which they claim reduce their catch by as much as one-third, blockaded shipping channels along the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION>. Under a court order to protect endagered sea turtles in a separate lawsuit by the <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> then ordered shrimpers who do n't use TEDs to limit their trawling times to 105 minutes at prescribed intervals. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON>, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund, said there has been `` no sign'' that <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> shrimpers are complying with the limited trawl times. Commerce spokesman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> said the department is waiting `` for the courts to make a judgment about the appropriateness of our course of action'' but declined to comment further because the matter is in litigation. According to the lawsuit, <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s decision suspending the TEDs regulations `` and replacing them with ineffective, inadequate interim regulations is causing irreparable harm to plaintiffs and their members by depriving them of the opportunity to study, observe, photograph and otherwise use and enjoy living sea turtles on their nesting beaches and in coastal waters.''

 <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new spiritual leader, indicated Tuesday the pragmatists of President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s government may find him on the oppisite side if they try a more open foreign policy. `` Arrogant powers like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies are not only against <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, but religion itself,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials and Iranian ambassadors, according to a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio report. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> should `` adopt Islamic positions in forging our country's foreign policy,'' he said `` Our foreign policy will not change in the future and we will continue with the same policy as before.'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> seeks more private investments and links with the West to obtain the technology and money needed to rebuild an economy shattered by the eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, appointed spiritual leader after the death June 3 of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, is believed to support <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> on many domestic issues. But he spoke out last week against negotiating with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about 16 Western hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, most of them by pro-Iranian extremists. Eight of the 16 hostages are Americans. Also Tuesday, heated arguments broke out in the parliament when hard-liners attacked an editorial published the day before in the conservative newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Ettelaat </ORGANIZATION>. The Farsi-language daily suggested many of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s economic woes were because of hostility toward the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in the early days of the revolution that overthrew the monarchy in February 1979. One member shouted that the editorial writer was `` a new <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>,'' a reference to the Indian-born British author of `` The Satanic Verses.'' On Feb. 14, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> ordered his followers to kill the novelist, who was born into a Moslem family, for blaspheming Islam. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> has been in hiding in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s order. Another respresentative said: `` No one will ever be allowed to take a step against the line of the Imam -LRB- <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> -RRB-.'' The man then shouted `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>!'' three times, with other members joining in. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio broadcast the parliamentary session live and it was monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. There was no way to identify the members making the comments. In the chair was <PERSON> Hojatoleslam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Karrubi </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as speaker of the 270-seat Majlis -LRB- parliament -RRB- earlier this month after <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> was elected president. Last weekend <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> submitted his proposed 22-member Cabinet to the Majis for approval. Confirmation debate is to begin Saturday. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> generally has appointed moderate, educated technocrats rather than ideologically committed revolutionaries.

<HEAD>Doctors Change Mrs. Bush's Medication to Fight Eye Problem</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 First lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was ordered onto new medication Tuesday after her doctors concluded there has been no improvement in a bothersome eye condition triggered by Graves disease, her spokeswoman said. However, Press Secretary <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said the specialists who examined Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during a two-hour session at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> also agreed that the disease's most serious threat _ an attack upon her thyroid gland _ has been controlled. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 64, interrupted her <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> vacation with the president to have the condition re-evaluated because of continuing problems with the irritating side effects involving her eyesight, including tearing and occasional double vision. Her doctors prescribed prednisone, a mild form of the steroid drug cortisone, in an attempt to stem the irritation, Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. The first lady's press office issued this formal statement: `` In the scheduled visit today to <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Graves disease was again evaluated by her physicians, Dr. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapiana </PERSON>, in consultation with other specialists from the <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` The thyroid function is under control, but the eye manifestation of the disease, which has included double vision, tearing and irritation, has not improved. For that reason, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will begin a daily treatment of prednisone, a form of cortisone. Her condition will be monitored over the next several months to determine whether further treatment is necessary.'' Prednisone, a steroid hydrocarbon, often is used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions, including arthritis and allegic disorders. It is regarded as having fewer side effects than cortisone. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not talk with reporters during the hospital visit. She left immediately afterward for nearby <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and a flight back to <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> on an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> executive jet. `` She was in fine spirits,'' Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. `` She said she did n't want me to think she was just goofing off up at <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>. She said she was helping <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> on the book.'' <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> is the first family's dog. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` co-authored'' a children's book with an earlier <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hound, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fred </PERSON>, several years ago. `` She thanked the doctors for taking the time out of their schedule,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. She quoted the first lady as saying `` I'm not going to stay long.'' Earlier this year, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was treated with radioactive iodine to render her thyroid gland inactive, and has since taken other medication maintain adequate hormone levels. Thyroid secretions regulate body growth and metabolism. Graves disease results from a mixup in the body's disease-fighting immune system The body produces antibodies that mistakenly attack the thyroid gland as an enemy. Instead of harming the gland, they stimulate it to grow and work non-stop, producing too much thyroid hormone. Though the tendency is passed from parent to child, no one knows precisely what triggers the antibody attack. Left untreated, Graves disease can be life threatening, but it generally responds to therapy.

<HEAD>Anti-Noriega Envoy Plans To Close Embassy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Panamanian Embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which has been under the control of forces opposed to Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, will be closed next week until democracy is restored to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, it was announced Tuesday. Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, who has used the embassy as an anti-Noriega headquarters for the past 18 months, made the disclosure in a telephone interview on the eve of an Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> foreign ministers meeting on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> was appointed ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by then-President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> two years ago. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was deposed by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s allies in February 1988 but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to regard him as the legitimate authority in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. It also has continued to recognize <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s official envoy. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said he has decided to close the embassy on Aug. 31 because Sept. 1 is the date on which <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s term was scheduled to expire. `` We have always maintained we are fighting for a constitutional principle,'' <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said, adding he and his family are vacating the embassy and will move to an apartment in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He intends to continue his struggle against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, he said. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have informed him they concur with his decision to close the embassy. Panamanian President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> attempted to replace <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> last year but the envoy, with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goverment support, refused to relinquish control of the embassy. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> has had partial access to Panamanian government funds in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> which were frozen by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to prevent <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from having access to them. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> has used the funds to keep the embassy functioning. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said he held little hope that an <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mediating team set up three months ago will be able to fulfill its mandate of achieving a democratic transfer of power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The crisis arose in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last May when, amid widespread allegations of fraud, Panamanian authorities threw out the results of the country's national elections. Independent observers said the anti-Noriega candidate, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, appeared to have won by a large margin. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mediators were due to return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Tuesday night and will present their report to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers on Wednesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, asking not to be identified, said it appear likely <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will arrange for <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> loyalist, to be replaced by an equally reliable successor on Sept. 1. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would retain behind-the-scenes control of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political life. This would fall short of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's objectives for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` We've supported the OAS mission,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` We've supported the mandate they have to achieve a transfer of power. We've stated very clearly that for that to occur <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go. We've stated very clearly our policy that there will be no accommodation with the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime,'' he said.

 The Labor Department's <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> released a proposal Tuesday that would reduce the permitted level of dust in mines as part of a general overhauling of workplace air quality standards. The proposal would require operators to implement new requirements for medical evaluation and transfer of miners exposed to certain carcinogens, a summary of the proposal said. The proposal would reduce the permitted amount of dust in the air, avberaged over an eight-hour shift, from 10 milligrams per cubic meter -LRB- 1.3 cubic yards or 35 cubic feet -RRB-, measured as non-quartz dust, to 5 milligrams of all breatheable dust not covered by a separate substance standard. The proposed new standard would cover more situations, the agency said. The separate standard for coal mines, 2 milligrams per cubic meter, the agency said. Among other things, the new standard for asbestos would be 200,000 fibers per cubic meter instead of 2 million fibers. This would bring the asbestos standard for mines into conformity with the general workplace standard adopted by the sister <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. The public may submit comments on the proposal until Nov. 27.

 Leftist guerrillas burned buses, bombed a government office and attacked army posts, killing 14 people and wounding 24 in two days, the military said Tuesday. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, rebels burned three buses and exploded a bomb at the <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to protest an increase in bus fares that took effect three weeks ago. No one was injured and the office was only slightly damaged. The attacks in the capital were part of rebel sabotage that began when bus fares were raised from a flat rate equivalent to six cents to a graduated scale ranging up to 14 cents. At least 35 buses have been damaged or destroyed. Nine soldiers and five guerrillas were killed on Monday and Tuesday at military posts in five provinces, and 12 rebels and 12 soldiers were wounded, the communique said, and three government offices were heavily damaged In a broadcast on the clandestine radio Venceremos, the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that rebels killed seven soldiers and wounded 37 Monday in eastern <LOCATION> Morazan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> provinces.

<TEXT>
 Lord <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Luton </LOCATION>, once a government minister but better known as the `` radio doctor'' dispensing advice on aches and pains, died Tuesday, his family said. He was 85. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> died at a nursing home near his home in <LOCATION> Harpenden </LOCATION>, 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The cause of death was not announced. A chubby pipe-smoker with an avuncular voice and the common touch, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> became a household name by using language clear to everyone when he gave medical advice on the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in World War II. `` A pain in the belly is a pain in the belly and not a discomfort in the abdomen'' was one of his comments. Discussing his theories about nutrition, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said: `` Better nutrition, better facilities for leisure and more security are more important to the health of this country than all the doctors, hospitals and clinics.'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> put himself through secondary school and <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on scholarships when his mother was widowed early. He trained at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, became a family physician, and in 1944 was appointed secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. In 1948, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> represented the doctors in negotiations with the new Labor government to set up the state <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which physicians initially opposed but now support. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s broadcasts for the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> from 1950 were credited with helping it regain power under Sir <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> in 1951. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was elected a Conservative lawmaker in 1950.

 The recent assassinations and the resulting government anti-drug crackdown in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> are the latest upheaval in a years-long struggle between authorities and the cocaine cartels in that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation. Here is a chronology:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Sept. 14, 1979 _ <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sign reciprocal treaty to combat drug trafficking.

<HEAD>Government Calls For Completion of Damage Studies by February</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A proposed government plan for determining damages from the Exxon oil spill released Tuesday called for environmental studies to be completed by next February, a time critics said was too short. The plan, drawn up by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, is a broad outline of procedures to be used in the assessment process that eventually will determine how much the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will have to pay to restore <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s environment, including long-term damages to wildlife and other natural resources. A group of government trustees, who are charged under federal law to make the long-term damage assessment, asked that interested parties comment on the broad outline by the end of September before it becomes final. The 258-page proposed plan makes no damage assessments nor does it set a dollar value on possible damages. However, the report directs that all environmental studies that are to be used in determining damage should be completed over the next six months. `` No further studies will be conducted after Feb. 28, 1990,'' the document says. If any additional studies are to be conducted after February they may be only at the recommendation of the government trustee council and scientific and legal review groups `` as being necessary to promote restoration and to support assessment of legally recoverable natural resource damages,'' the document said. The short timetable brought almost immediate criticism from some environmental groups, who claim that significant damages from the spill last March off southern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> will not be known for years. In fact, cleanup efforts are not even likely to be completed by then, resulting in cases where oil may still be causing new damages, the critics maintained. `` This plan could lead to a serious underestimation of harm to the environment and a limited recovery of damages from Exxon,'' maintained <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Chasis </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` The first year's damages will tell only part of the story.'' Ms. <PERSON> Chasis </PERSON> said there also is concern that the plan does not make clear the role of the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in the assessment plan. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> executives have said they want to participate in the determination of damages to wildlife and natural resources as a result of the March 24 spill that dumped 11 million gallons of oil into pristine Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The proposed assessment plan said a decision on whether to allow <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to participate and if so, to what extent, has yet to be made. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, acknowleged that there had been discussions on whether to allow longer studies of environmental damages before moving ahead to making actual damage assessments. According to other sources, who asked not to be identified, some participants argued that in some cases as long as five years may be needed to determine damages to certain wildlife. `` The trustees wanted to get to restoration as fast as possible and not take a leisurely approach to studying whatever needs to be studied,'' said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. He said the timetable is not necessarily final and objections can be raised by intrested parties during the comment period. Some of the studies to be completed by February already are under way, said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The government Tuesday accused <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> of hyprocrisy for its decision requiring that ethnic Turks immigrating from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> first obtain visas. Turkish border officials said they had strict orders, beginning Tuesday, to turn away the refugees waiting to cross into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. However, the semi-official Turkish news agency <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> said 522 were allowed to cross without visas anyway. The refugees say they are fleeing a harsh assimilation campaign in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. The Turkish government announced its move Monday, saying it would require the visas because <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s communist leaders have refused to start talks on an accord to protect the emigrants. Turkish officials said the new requirement would give them more control over the influx. However, Turkish opposition parties accused the government of backing away from its pledge to accept all ethnic Turks who want to come. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> was summoned to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to hear Bulgarian complaints about the `` exceedingly harsh predicament'' of thousands of Bulgarian Turks en route to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, the official Bulgarian <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. `` The Turkish government's decision to close its border to Bulgarian citizens proves the hypocrisy and the instigation of the Turkish mass media and officials who used to claim that unobstructed admission will be secured for all Muslim Bulgarians,'' <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> quoted the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Rabotnichesko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delo </ORGANIZATION> as saying. `` This decision debunked a myth which has been persistently propagated by the stage managers of the anti-Bulgarian propaganda: that <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> is the ` mother country,' the real homeland of Moslem Bulgarians,'' the newspaper said. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> blames <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> for refusing to hold talks on reaching an immigration agreement, <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said. About 310,000 Bulgarian Turks have flooded into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> in the past three months. They say the assimilation campaign, begun in 1984, has prevented them from using their Turkish names, speaking Turkish or practicing Islamic rites. About 1.5 million ethnic Turks live in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> says an immigration accord should stipulate that those who leave be compensated for property left behind and accumulated social security. It also says families should be kept together. Turkish officials say ethnic Turks can now obtain visas from <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s consulates at <LOCATION> Burgas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> said Turkish authorities tried to turn back the refugees who crossed at the Kapuikule border post Tuesday without visas. However, some of the refugees tried to jump from the windows of the train they were in, and officials agreed to let the group cross, the agency said. In <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, members of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional delegation criticized <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. Senators <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McEwen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, said they interviewed ethnic Turks in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> who were waiting near the border on Monday to go to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. `` It was painfully obvious that the Bulgarian government had forced, by its policies of discrimination against Turks in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children out of their homes with only the possessions they can carry,'' <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> told a news conference Tuesday in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>. The Americans are members of the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords on human rights signed by 35 nations in 1975.

<TEXT>
 State-run media on Tuesday blamed foreigners visiting under the guise of tourists for stirring up protests by thousands on the 21st anniversary of the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Authorities said 370 people, including 50 foreigners, were arrested. By Tuesday night, no word emerged on the fate of Hungarians, Poles and Italians arrested when hundreds of helmeted riot police wielding truncheons broke up crowds demanding freedom and withdrawal of Soviet troops who crushed the `` Prague Spring'' reforms 21 years ago. Hungarian consul <PERSON> Lajos </PERSON> <PERSON> Taba </PERSON> said his embassy received telephone calls indicating nine Hungarians were detained. Polish press attache <PERSON> Kzrysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Opalski </PERSON> said he heard on state radio that three Poles were held, but that the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> had given his embassy no official word on detentions. Extra police remained on patrol Tuesday in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s central Wenceslas Square, checking the papers of bystanders and Western journalists. A folk group and brass band played on the spot where Monday's protests erupted. <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> radio asserted that 1,000 Italians and 3,000 Polish Solidarity activists had come to the capital under what it termed `` tourism in disguise'' to stir up the demonstrations. `` The provocation was brought about by those who traveled under the guise of tourism,'' said a similar commentary on TV. `` They came here to give us advice. Nobody likes this and we Czechoslovaks are no exception.'' The commentaries were an apparent attempt by <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s entrenched leadership to ignore domestic pressure for reform and depict such pressure as the work of outsiders In a dispatch from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency challenged Czechoslovak media reports. `` It is worth stressing that there is no proof that Poles and Solidarity representatives took part in the disturbances in downtown <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the Polish Embassy was unable to obtain the identities of any Poles detained and sent a note to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> seeking information so it can `` get in touch with them and explain their legal position.'' In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> summoned <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s charge d'affaires to complain that the detention of the Italians was `` unjustified'' and the behavior of Czechoslovak authorities was `` in clear contradiction with the new climate of faith and openness characterizing East-West relations. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION>, quoting ministry sources, said eight Italians were arrested in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. Czechoslovak authorities and media had campaigned for weeks prior to the anniversary against independent groups and warned that force would be used to break up protests. Police have cracked down hard on independent activists in recent weeks, harassing several and cutting their telephones. Charter 77 spokeswoman <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemcova </PERSON> said Tuesday that dozens of people were put in preventive detention over the weekend. Some of those were free Tuesday, but others were still unaccounted for, said <PERSON> Nemcova </PERSON>, who with her activist son, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, was under house arrest from early Sunday until late Monday night. Many other leading activists were warned to stay out of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and other big cities. Some, including prominent human rights campaigner <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, appealed against street protests, fearing bloodshed. Several of the 370 people the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Rude Pravo said were detained Monday were beaten by police. But the newspaper said no one was seriously hurt. Police attacks on Western journalists drew strong criticism abroad. Austrian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON> condemned what he termed the `` aggressive behavior'' of the police, who detained two Austrian cameramen, sliced their camera cable with a knife, and struck one of the crew. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> protested the rough handling of two Italian journalists who, the Italian television channel <PERSON> Rai </PERSON> <PERSON> Due </PERSON> said, were punched by plainclothes men and had their cameras damaged. A West German TV crew also was detained briefly Monday in what appeared to be an attempt by police to limit footage shown on Western TV stations that can be received in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and to curb damage to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s reputation abroad. The Communist leadership put in power after <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> crushed the 1968 reforms has come under mounting pressure at home and from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc reformers to adopt some of the changes under way in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 An East German was shot to death in a struggle with Hungarian border guards, officials said Tuesday, intensifying a diplomatic crisis caused by thousands of East Germans fleeing their rigid communist regime. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> repeated an offer to meet with East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> on the refugee problem, but said only reforms would halt the flow. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said it was closing its embassy in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, to refugees because it was overwhelmed by East German refugees. Government sources said more than 100 East Germans had packed the embassy to demand emigration help. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> closed its embassy in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> and its mission in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> this month because of the crush of East Germans trying to get to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. About 200 East Germans fled across the Hungarian-Austrian border Tuesday in the second mass flight in four days, border guards and police said in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, bringing the total of East Germans arriving in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> on Tuesday to about 500. The Hungarian news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported the first death resulting from the wave of escapes. It said <PERSON> Kurt-Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> was shot about 30 feet inside <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> Monday night while trying to cross the border with his wife and 6-year-old daughter. MTI described the shooting Monday as an accident. It said the wife and child were unhurt and were in Hungarian custody, adding that the family failed in an earlier border-crossing attempt. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> began dismantling its barbed-wire barrier with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in May. Until the <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> incident, no serious injuries were reported in the illegal exodus, but hundreds were caught and detained for short periods. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> authorities can take years to process applications for legal emigration and often reject specialists and younger workers because of the nation's widespread labor shortage. Travel visas to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> are relatively easy for East Germans to obtain, and some of the estimated 200,000 traveling in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> this month have taken their chances with what appeared to be a new escape route to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said of the <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> case that it `` disturbed over the death of a fellow German.'' It demanded a detailed explanation and Hungarian assurances that armed force would not be used to halt East German escapees. The rate of escapes and emigration to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this year is the largest migration from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall was built in 1961, and may exceed 100,000 by the end of the year. More than 65,000 East Germans have arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1989, including more than 2,000 who escaped illegally in recent weeks by sneaking through recently relaxed borders between <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Refugees flooding the main West German transit camp in <LOCATION> Giessen </LOCATION> have said they left after losing hope that <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s leadership would ever ease restrictions on travel, emigration and expression. The latest mass escape took place Tuesday evening near <LOCATION> Klingenbach </LOCATION>, Austrian customs officers said. They said buses would take the 200 East Germans to the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, which is providing hotel accommodation for newly arriving East Germans. Earlier Tuesday, about 300 East Germans crossed into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> at various border points, hours after <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> was shot. A mass escape of East Germans took place Saturday when 661 people walked into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> after a border barrier, normally closed, was opened for an international picnic. The shooting occurred near <LOCATION> Lutzmannsburg </LOCATION>, about 15 miles south of <LOCATION> Sopron </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> knocked a guard down with his bag and kicked him in the head after two border patrols fired warning shots and ordered the family to stop. The fray took the participants into Austrian territory, it said. The agency said <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> tried to seize the guard's gun and it went off, fatally wounding <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>. He died while guards were taking him back to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for medical aid, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> and the Austrian <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported. Most of the 171 East Germans in the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> are people caught in escape attempts. Despite East German assurances they wo n't be punished if they return voluntarily, they refuse to leave. Under the West German constitution, East Germans are entitled to immediate citizenship in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. East German authorities have told <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> relations could suffer if <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s embassies in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> continue to shelter the refugees. `` We do n't want a confrontation,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. But he made clear that changes must be made within <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to halt the escape trend. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> dismissed <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s contention the escape spree is the result of Western enticement. `` The pressure for change is not coming from the West, but from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said, applauding the reform movement sweeping those countries.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made clear Tuesday that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> can not solve its problems without the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a party spokesman said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who leads the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, spoke for 40 minutes by telephone with <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said party spokesman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bisztyga </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> expressed confidence that the Polish party would successfully solve the social and economic problems in the interest of socialism and voiced the conviction that solving these problems is impossible without'' the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bisztyga </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is pressing for maximum representation in the new Cabinet. The conversation came as <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, the Solidarity prime minister-designate, held talks on forming the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first government led by non-communists. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> met with leaders of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s political factions and said he hopes to form his government within a week. The parliament vote to confirm his nomination as prime minister was postponed from Wednesday to Thursday to allow further consultations, said Sejm Speaker <PERSON> Mikolaj </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozakiewicz </PERSON>. Although there are enough votes for <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s election, even without support from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the prime minister-designate faces the delicate task of balancing competing interests in the new alliance. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> met <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Janowski </PERSON>, the floor leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, outgoing Prime Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Orzechowski </PERSON>, the parliamentary leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The long, one-on-one meeting with <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> at an undisclosed location was `` serious and interesting,'' <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> said afterward at the offices of the Solidarity weekly he edits. Later at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> said he had `` a very intensive conversation about problems which interest us'' with <PERSON> Orzechowski </PERSON>. He also met with the speakers of the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the two chambers of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The distribution of portfolios and the name of future ministers are the capital's most sought-after secret, and the competition for them among parties apparently is intense. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> has so far given no details of his intentions, saying only that he wants the `` broadest possible'' coalition of pro-reform forces from every party. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was promised the defense and interior ministries, controlling the army and police, as part of Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s agreement with President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, who is allowing Solidarity to take charge of the first non-communist government in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in more than 40 years. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> resolution Sunday, demanded more than those two ministries and has said it wants to be treated as a full governing partner. The two minor parties that joined a coalition with Solidarity are also pressing for the maximum number of seats. `` Are there enough portfolios?'' the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> asked in an ironic headline. There are 19 government ministries or government leve offices, but the number could be expanded or reduced. For instance, Solidarity has discussed creating a ministry for national minorities. According to the newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> wants five ministries plus a deputy premiership. The Democrats want three to four ministries and one deputy prime minister, <PERSON> Janowski </PERSON> said in a statement issued by <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>. The Democrats favor `` the principle of avoiding a decisive domination of any of the forces participating in the government,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has said it must have enough ministries to correspond to its `` political and state potential,'' but has not said what that number is. <PERSON> Orzechowski </PERSON> declined to comment on his party's demands after meeting <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. The party's top body, the Politburo, met Tuesday to consider its stance on the government. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is `` ready to take up co-responsibility determined by the responsibilities which are created for it,'' according to a statement carried by <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>. Tensions emerged between the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its former coalition partners as the Democrats and Peasants issued statements critical of an Aug. 19 <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> resolution that said a Solidarity-led government would be `` destabilizing.'' As <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a longtime adviser to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, began steps to assemble a government, there were signs of anxiety about the future of a non-communist government. The opposition newspaper carries a front-page cartoon showing a wall with graffiti saying, `` The summer is yours, the ZOMO -LRB- riot police -RRB- are ours.'' A war of words continued between the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, with the party daily criticizing the union leader's statement Monday in which he warned the party to abandon `` threats and blackmail.'' `` It is a pity there are only generalities -LRB- in <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s statement -RRB- It would be worthwhile to point out the parts of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> stands which are ` threats and blackmail,''' the editorial said. `` These are sharp words which should not be used by either of the two main political forces in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' that is Solidarity or the party, the editorial said. It said the party is only being reasonable when it says it will withhold support from the <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> government until it learns its program. It said the party can not agree that Solidarity has `` common and unlimited support'' in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.

 A former secretary for ex-Attorney General <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was indicted Tuesday on charges she extorted money from <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> to keep quiet about a pregnancy he allegedly was responsible for. The indictment came one day after <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> abruptly quit rather than face a grand jury investigation. The indictment charged <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, with one count of extortion and one count of obtaining money under false pretenses. In addition, her attorneys dropped a $ 3 million libel suit filed Aug. 11 against The <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>, citing the criminal investigation. The Gazette had reported that <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, 35, who worked for the attorney general in 1985 and 1986, demanded $ 50,000 from <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> to keep quiet about getting pregnant by him and having an abortion in 1986. Both <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> denied the allegations when they were made by the Gazette. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said she had a baby girl in July 1986, but the child died the next day. She said the father was <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Thaxton </PERSON>, her husband. The indictment said she obtained at least $ 200 from <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, which is the legal minimum to bring the felony charge, said <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>. The indictment said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had appeared before the grand jury that indicted <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said the state had reports that <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> obtained $ 7,500 to $ 50,000 from <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> from January to December 1986. `` She signed a note saying she had an abortion,'' <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. Asked if <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was the father of the child, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said, `` Obviously, he thought so.'' If convicted of extortion, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> faces up to five years in prison, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. The false pretenses charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years and a $ 500 fine on conviction. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a Democrat, resigned Monday. In return, the <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor's office dismissed the grand jury probe into allegations that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> lied under oath and grew to include his campaign financial records. Gov. <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> will name a successor to <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. Lawyers for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> filed a notice Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> asking for the dismissal of the lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>. According to her lawyers, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s testimony in her civil suit would compromise her in the criminal investigation. <PERSON> Crady </PERSON> <PERSON> Swisher </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, declined comment on the indictment and dropping of the lawsuit. <PERSON> Thaxton </PERSON>, reached at the couple's home in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said his wife would have no comment. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 39, whose brother is secretary of state of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, read a statement to reporters Tuesday morning, saying he was stepping down from the post to shield his 5-year-old daughter from continuing publicity about the case. He declined to answer questions. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he did not lie during sworn statements at a child support hearing in May, when he corrected himself after misspeaking at one point in questioning. The questions allegedly dealt with <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and the funds, the <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s financial records from 1984 and 1988 were subpoenaed as part of the grand jury investigation, but <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> declined to say what they were looking for. He said the case is closed. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, first elected in 1984 and re-elected in 1988, was found innocent in 1986 on eight state misdemeanor counts of soliciting his staff for campaign contributions. He is the second top state official to resign this year. Ex-Treasurer <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> quit July 9 rather than face an impeachment trial in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> on Tuesday announced the top 12 alleged Colombian drug traffickers the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> wants extradited and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not bow to fears that it might become the target of the violence that has plagued <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. `` Whatever consequences ensue from our enforcing the law are part of the risk that we assume in a society that depends upon the rule of law,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said during a sidewalk news conference. `` We ca n't succumb in this country to what has already brought the criminal justice system to its knees in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` They are rising from their knees, they are standing up to these drug traffickers and they deserve every bit of support that we can give them, and that support will be forthcoming.'' The `` Dozen Most Wanted'' list includes the leadership of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Cali </PERSON> cocaine cartels, but not the one alleged <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> money-launderer who has been arrested in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said, `` We are taking steps to provide the necessary documentation to secure his extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' A Colombian official said in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> that the first moves toward extraditing <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> had already been made. In all, about 80 alleged Colombian drug traffickers are under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but their cases have languished since the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned its extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987, the department said. Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> instituted emergency measures over the weekend to allow the immediate resumption of extraditions. His action was triggered by the assassination Friday of <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, a leading presidential candidate and an outspoken foe of the drug traffickers. Colombian drug gangs assassinated more than 50 magistrates and judges in recent years, and had almost terrorized all other civil and military authorities into acquiescence to their operations. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> praised the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government's crackdown that has resulted in the arrests of some 11,000 people. `` We are very grateful for the ... kind of courage that has been displayed'' by the Colombians, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. The efforts, he said, `` can lead to better cooperation in securing criminal convictions of these very prominent figures in the drug cartels.'' Included in the list of the top 12 are reputed <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel leaders <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, 39, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, 40, and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, 42. Also on the list are: _ Two of <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>'s brothers, <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON>, 32, and <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, 41, along with <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivero </PERSON>, 42, and <PERSON> Gerardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncada </PERSON>, 42 All are allegedly members of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. _ <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> <PERSON> Acero </PERSON>, 37, a former policeman who allegedly works with the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel He is `` the gunman ... who was responsible for the attempted murder of two of our agents down there,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>. _ The reputed leaders of the <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION> cartel: <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Orjuela </PERSON>, 50; <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Orjuela </PERSON>, 45; and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Santacruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Londono </PERSON>, 45 Also on the list is alleged <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION> cartel member <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Orjuela </PERSON> <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON>, 46. `` Facing trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is what these drug lords fear the most,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had said earlier in a statement. `` This list of a dozen priority offenders is only the first phase of our extradition efforts. Our review of those whom we seek for trial is on-going and the list is likely to be supplemented in the near future.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said during the news conference that in addition to supplying the names to the Colombians, the names have also been put on the <ORGANIZATION> INTERPOL </ORGANIZATION> network to encourage international efforts to find those that may have fled <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> because of the crackdown. `` We do n't know the whereabouts of any of these individuals,'' he said. Asked what the Colombians need the most to fight the drug cartels, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the `` enormous appetite for drugs'' must be curbed. `` Every cocaine sniffer and crack smoker in this country contributes to the violence and the enormous profits that are reaped by the Colombian drug traffickers,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said the complete list of people whose extradition may be sought numbers from 50 to 100. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is reviewing that list to determine which extraditions should be sought if the targets are arrested.

 A <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> newspaper reports there may have been an Arab connection in the assassination of Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>. It was the latest suggestion foreign mercenaries are involved in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s drug-related bloodshed. Earlier accounts in the news media have said there were indications British, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and South African mercenaries were training assassination teams for the drug cartels. <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, the nation's leading presidential candidate, was shot on Friday at a political rally. The killing prompted an emergency declaration by authorities and a crackdown on the powerful drug cartels. According to the conservative <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Siglo </ORGANIZATION>, police are investigating what appears to be an Arab link to <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>'s murder. It quoted an unidentified witness on Monday as saying that just before the killing the man who shot <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> was heard speaking to an accomplice in a foreign language, and the killer left behind at the scene a copy of the Egyptian newspaper <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahram </PERSON>. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Siglo </PERSON> carried a photograph of the newspaper, dated June 3, 1989. Police said the drug cartel based in the industrial city of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, the world center for cocaine trafficking, had offered $ 1 million for <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>'s assassination. An attempt to kill him on Aug. 4 was frustrated by authorities. Military and police authorities also say the drug cartels are using some of their billion-dollar profits to arm and train squads of hired assassins in a loose association with right-wing extremists. On April 10, local newspapers cited national police documents as saying that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and British mercenaries were providing training to the death squads at camps in a rural northeastern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Shortly after those reports a national television chain broadcast a video tape it said was received from the death squads. It showed men in military-style uniforms training with high-powered automatic weapons. The video included an interview with a purported trainer, who spoke Spanish with a foreign accent and kept his back turned to the cameara. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nightly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> on Monday showed videotape it said was obtained from Colombian television of `` drug assassins in training at a secret base camp somewhere in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>.'' It said the video was made available by the cocaine cartel, `` apparently as a kind of video warning of what the cartel would do if the government moved against it.'' The reporter, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> authorities identified some of the trainers shown in the video as `` Israelis and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>, former military men now training Colombian drug armies in assassination and terror techniques.'' On Aug. 13, the <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> reported that British mercenaries are being used by a drug cartel based in the city of <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION> that is engaged in a bloody, 18-month-old feud with the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. The newspaper said British mercenaries were hired to kill <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel leader <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> by bombing a rural ranch he owns from two helicopters. It said one helicopter was too weighted down with arms and crashed on June 4, and the other turned back. The paper said that upon learning of the attempt, <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> launched a similar plot to kill <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION> cartel boss <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Orijuela </PERSON>, but mechanical failure forced the <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> helicopter to make an emergency landing July 12. Authorities have confirmed accidents involving helicopters on the dates cited in the reports. In both cases, police pilots were involved, officials said. In the July 12 incident, authorities reported finding $ 259,000 in cash abroad the aircraft. But officials cast doubt on the report. `` The newspaper reports events that really have taken place but it frames them in a novel situation that goes beyond qualification,'' said police Gen. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Casadiego </PERSON>.

 A 9-year-old girl who trudged through snow and rain last winter selling Girl Scout cookies in hopes of meeting the governor finally gets her chance Wednesday, long after writing an essay titled `` I Did n't Meet the Governor, But I Got to Know Myself.'' <PERSON> Robyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> wrote the eight-page essay after she sold 1,504 boxes of cookies _ more than any other Hartford-area Brownie or Scout sold last winter _ but still had n't met Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, as someone had mistakenly promised her she would. In the handwritten essay, Miss <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON> tells of her inspiration for selling the cookies _ her grandmother's challenge and the promise of a photo opportunity with the governor. She also recounts some of the things she learned during two cookie-selling seasons. `` I learned that selling cookies for 6 hours strate made my legs real tired and my hands froozen,'' she wrote. `` I learned that people buy cookies best when you sell them during a snowstorm. Because I looked so sad and helpless standing there with icesickles hanging off my nose. `` Sometimes when I called up people on the fone and they would hang up on me before I got to say what I wanted to say. I would call them back and say ` Excuse me but we were acsidently cut off! Now as I was saying ...' And then they would usually buy cookies and mommy and I would laugh and laugh!'' After selling 1,165 boxes in the winter of 1987-88, second-best in the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> area, Miss <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON> set out last winter with her mother and her brother <PERSON> Jayson </PERSON> and earned top sales honors. Prizes included a videocassette recorder, but not a meeting with the governor. `` I still wish I could meet the governor though,'' the fourth-grader wrote. `` Maybe he'd like to buy a box or two of cookies.'' The essay, written at her mother's urging last December, was published in a Girl Scout newsletter and eventually found its way into <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s hands. `` He read the story and said it was a remarkable accomplishment,'' said gubernatorial press secretary <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandberg </PERSON>. `` He asked us to find her and ask her if she wanted to come in.'' In a telephone interview Tuesday, Miss <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON> looked forward to her visit to the Capitol and offered advice to other would-be cookie moguls: `` Always look adorable.'' Also, she said, `` I always ask people if they would like to try the honey-glazed chocolate chip.''

 Workers at 25 state factories and businesses in the republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> were on strike for a second day Tuesday to press ethnic demands for control of a disputed territory, according to local sources. In the republic of <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>, workers walked off the job for the second time in five days to protest proposed legislation that would make Moldavian that republic's official language. Nine factories were closed in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barsky </PERSON>, editor in chief of the Azerinform news agency, said from the capital of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>. But other local residents said the strike was much broader, affecting almost 100 businesses and involving hundreds of thousands of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> residents. <PERSON> Nazim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragimov </PERSON>, a journalist, said the work stoppages included an oil refinery, several defense plants, an air-conditioner factory and five loading docks. The strike was schedulewd to end Tuesday night, but organizers have threatened to prolong it or call a general strike for Sept. 2 if they are not satisfied by the government response. The walkout was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a group that is fighting for Azerbaijani control over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a mostly Armenian region taken from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> earlier this year. The region was put under the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s direct control to settle a dispute over it between the republics of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has sponsored mass rallies in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> for weeks.

 <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, seized in a weekend sweep by Colombian authorities, had escaped arrest last spring in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on the day <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials announced his indictment in connection with a $ 1.2 billion money-laundering operation. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, described by Colombian officials as a 35-year-old economist, was indicted in March as part of `` Operation Polar Cap,'' which resulted in charges against 127 people and two Latin American banks. `` He's one of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel's financial chiefs, not the biggest one, but certainly an important one,'' <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shults </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` His arrest is the arrest of a significant figure in that investigation.'' Polar Cap uncovered a money-laundering operation that reached across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, with direct ties to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said. It laundered an estimated $ 1.2 billion over two years, they said. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was arrested during the weekend in the northern Department of <LOCATION> Sucre </LOCATION>, and Colombian national police said they started proceedings Tuesday to hand <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a test of a new emergency plan for extraditing people alleged to be top drug traffickers. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is moving to extradite <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, despite the fact that his name was not on a list of the `` Dozen Most Wanted'' drug traffickers <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> sent Tuesday to the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government. The list focused on the leaders of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cali </ORGANIZATION> cartels. `` We are taking steps to provide the necessary documentation to secure his extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. The attorney general said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> is the `` only individual facing indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that we know of who has been picked up'' by Colombian authorities. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, said later that it was not clear how long the process would take. `` The quickest thing that could happen is they could put him on a plane and send him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' without waiting for any additional paperwork, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was among 11,000 people arrested in an emergency crackdown triggered by Friday's assassination of a leading presidential candidate who was an outspoken foe of drug traffickers. The <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> declared his innocence in statements made while jailed in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. `` At no time have I had links to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel and I do n't know any of its members,'' he was quoted as saying The newspaper said that, when arrested, he had none of the heavily armed bodyguards who usually accompany drug lords. On March 29, the day the Polar Cap indictments were announced, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was holed up in a bank in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, surrounded by <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> seeking to arrest him for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> had been scheduled to meet that day with undercover agents in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, he said. However, later in the afternoon, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> somehow managed to escape from the bank, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagel </PERSON>, a trial attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s narcotics section. The Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> are headed by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on federal drug-trafficking charges. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> is described in the indictment as an associate and agent of <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncada </PERSON>, whom the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government accused of organizing, supervising and managing for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel the importation, sale and distribution of cocaine in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and, in particular, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. According to the indictment, issued in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was involved mainly with `` La Mina,'' or `` The Mine,'' the name the drug world uses for the money-laundering operation. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> directly contracted with `` La Mina'' and the undercover agents of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to launder the illegal drug proceeds of the cartel, the indictment says. `` <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> acted as a ` broker' in negotiating with various money-laundering groups as to their cost and services in laundering the cartel's drug monies,'' the indictment says. `` <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> paid monies to co-defendants <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Guarin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> to ensure that laundered drug proceeds which had been transferred to co-defendant <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occidente </ORGANIZATION> were not seized by law enforcement authorities.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occidente </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, a Panamanian institution, pleaded guilty earlier this month to laundering more than $ 400 million in drug money through wire transfers that government agents traced to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. The <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> branch agreed to pay a $ 5 million penalty in a plea bargain in which the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government agreed to dismiss all charges against the Colombian parent company and release $ 72 million in frozen assets in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 A 3-ton killer whale died before thousands of horrified spectators in a bloody fight with another whale over the captive mammals' pecking order during a show at Sea World, officials said Tuesday. <PERSON> Kandu </PERSON>, a 14-year-old whale who gave birth to a calf in the same tank during a show last year, suffered an upper jaw fracture when she struck <PERSON> Corky </PERSON>, an 8,000-pound female believed to be about 25, on Monday, Sea World veterinarians said. The fracture triggered a massive hemorrhage into <PERSON> Kandu </PERSON>'s nasal passages, and she bled to death within 45 minutes, said veterinarian <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McBain </PERSON>. Spectators saw the whale spouting blood. <LOCATION> Kandu </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Corky </PERSON> were seen circling the 5 million-gallon tank and gathering speed in the moment before the collision, which occurred in a holding pen next to the show pool area, witnesses said. `` The two adult whales were coming into the show pen when it seemed like they collided,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Stansbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, who was at the show. Trainers called <PERSON> Kandu </PERSON> to the pool's side, and her baby, 11-month-old <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamu </PERSON>, followed, said another spectator, <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hass </PERSON>. `` They gave her that little pat signal, and she rolled over and the little baby rolled over, too,'' <PERSON> Hass </PERSON> said, `` and the blood came out and it was all over the sidewalk and everywhere.'' <PERSON> Corky </PERSON> escaped the collision with minor rake marks from <LOCATION> Kandu </LOCATION>'s teeth <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Knootka </PERSON>, a third adult female killer whale at the park, were not involved in the collision. <PERSON> Kandu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Corky </PERSON> had several skirmishes before the fatal episode, <PERSON> McBain </PERSON> said. He described the behavior as a ritualized combat initiated by the younger <PERSON> Kandu </PERSON> to assert her dominance. `` Kandu was the dominant female,'' <PERSON> McBain </PERSON> said. `` Periodically, <PERSON> Kandu </PERSON> would assert herself so that <PERSON> Corky </PERSON> knew that <PERSON> Kandu </PERSON> was still the superior of the two individuals. `` What was not part of the normal scenario was the way she impacted because what ended up happening ... is <PERSON> Kandu </PERSON> did fatal damage to herself,'' <PERSON> McBain </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kandu </PERSON> `` essentially was battered to death,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> is the parent agency of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which is looking into <PERSON> Kandu </PERSON>'s death <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> said the federal agency received a preliminary report from <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, and had no problems with the park's decision to resume its popular killer whale shows Tuesday. Killer whales and marine mammals in general often fight, ram, chase and nip each other as part of maintaining a social hierarchy, said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, who has studied whales for 35 years. <PERSON> McBain </PERSON> said it was best to maintain some semblance of normalcy and go on with the shows for the well-being of the park's three remaining whales. The shows have been scaled down, and trainers are not being allowed in the water for the time being. All three whales `` know something is different,'' <PERSON> McBain </PERSON> said. The two adults seem to have adjusted to <PERSON> Kandu </PERSON>'s loss, but <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamu </PERSON> took it harder. `` The baby was showing a little confusion ... and then acts as if she's expecting mom to show up at any time,'' <PERSON> McBain </PERSON> said. `` She was agitated last night but she's much more relaxed now.''

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 12-party opposition coalition would return confiscated land and dismantle much of the army if elected in February's scheduled balloting, according to a document obtained Tuesday. The opposition platform also envisions maintaining state control of foreign trade while freeing the domestic market. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a loose coalition ranging from communists to conservatives, debated the plan Tuesday and the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> obtained a copy. The final version was expected to be released later this week. Nicaraguans are scheduled to vote in a general election February for the first time since the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> won a civil war and came to power 10 years ago. The balloting comes under democratic reforms the leftist regime promised in exchange for U.S.-backed rebels ending their 7-year-old war against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. The opposition is expected to announce its candidates for president and vice president this week. The coalition platform covers a broad political range. It states the intent of the coalition's `` Government of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION>'' to protect private property and guarantees workers' right to unionize, participate in managing enterprises and share profits At the same time it promises to advance some measures of the Sandinista programs such as the literacy campaign, while eliminating the military draft. But in trying to please all sides of the coalition the plan treads on shaky ground. One of the strongest cards held by the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> is its commitment to giving land to peasants. Responding to this, the coalition document says `` to the poor and middle-income peasants will be guaranteed the legitimate property of the land they have in their possession.'' But it also says `` to peasant families who have been dispossessed, inasmuch as is possible, their farm will be returned, or they will be compensated with another -LRB- farm -RRB-.'' `` To the dispossessed of the countryside, they will be given state land with the right to acquire it for free as their legitimate property.'' Since taking power in 1979, and as recently as June, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have seized land belonging to the late President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> and his supporters and to private farmers in retaliation for political opposition. The Sandinistas led the revolt that ousted <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in July 1979. The <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> family had ruled <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for decades. The distribution of land to peasants, although often resulting in a drop in production, has garnered the Sandinistas popular support. The 14-page document says the country would have a military but mentions several times the intent to restructure and drastically reduce it `` according to the country's economic capacity and social needs.'' With the war between the Sandinistas and rebels, known as Contras, over, troops on both sides `` should dedicate themselves to study and production,'' the platform said. The Sandinistas army, estimated to have 200,000 members in a country with a population of 3.5 million, is the largest in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and receives 60 percent of the annual national budget. The most likely opposition candidates for president are <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, whose family owns the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON> <PERSON> Geyer </PERSON>, a businessman, and <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> used the opening Tuesday of a new relay station for the government radio network to appeal to Contras based in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to demobilize. `` You can put down your arms, accept the peace plan,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. `` You're not going to be put in jail, you're not going to be put on trial. ... The Nicaraguan people will give you the opportunity to rejoin society.'' About 11,000 rebels and 12,000 dependents are in camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The Sandinista government says 2,500 more are inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the new transmitting station, which relays broadcasts from <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, will beam reports to the camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. He said the station in <LOCATION> Esteli </LOCATION>, 93 miles north of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, was built with Soviet aid. `` The contribution from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is exemplary and should be -LRB- the example -RRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> follows in its relations with Latin American countries and in particular, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said.

 A reputed drug lord facing extradition from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is among the alleged criminals caught up in `` Operation Polar Cap,'' which has been described as the biggest money-laundering probe in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. The multi-agency investigation involved more than two years of infiltrating and unthreading a tangled web spun from a bogus gold shipping and smelting scam, tons of drugs, hundreds of millions of dollars and fast and free-wheeling foreign bank deals. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Caffrey </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s office here, confirmed that <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, a 35-year-old Colombian economist and reputed financial wizard behind the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel was a Polar Cap suspect. The cartel is believed to be responsible for most cocaine shipments to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> was among thousands arrested in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in recent days in a crackdown on drug kingpins that followed the assassination Friday of a presidential candidate and the slayings earlier that week of a judge and a police official. <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> faces extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Papers filed in federal court in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> say the money-laundering operation, known by its users as <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mina </LOCATION> _ `` the mine'' _ laundered about $ 1.2 billion in drug money between 1987 and February 1989. Operation Polar Cap investigators uncovered the operation and found evidence that led to a guilty plea by <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occidente </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to charges it laundered drug money. The plea was entered earlier this month in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occidente </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> forfeited $ 5 million to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Similar charges against the bank's parent institution, <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occidente </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, were dismissed as a result of the plea A government document filed with the plea said the probe also led to the arrest of <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON>, who apparently set up <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Mina </PERSON> in mid-1985. <PERSON> Hochman </PERSON> pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges this spring and named <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON> and others as accomplices. La <PERSON> Mina </PERSON> involved the money from the drug sales going to <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hochman </PERSON>, who took commissions of up to 12 percent, the government said. The owners of the money provided the two with account numbers in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hochman </PERSON> then would telephone a firm in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and order gold equal to the amount of money from the drug sales, minus the commission. But the gold that was sent actually was lead, covered with enough gold to pass a `` scratch test'' should one be given. The `` gold'' was taken by courier to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to refineries owned by the two or to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> financial operation involved in the money laundering. The refinery would certify that the `` gold'' was real and buy it. The money was wired back to <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Mina </PERSON> accounts in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, then was wired to a <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> bank or to black-market exchange houses in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, ending up in the bank accounts of drug traffickers. Polar Cap investigators infiltrated the money-laundering network by offering an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> money-laundering service. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> called Polar Cap `` the largest narcotic money-laundering investigation ever conducted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement agencies.'' It involved hundreds of agents and cooperation from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and has resulted in charges against 127 people and two foreign banks.

<TEXT>
 A 62-year-old woman who was put on 10 years probation for killing her husband spoke Tuesday of years of broken bones and bruises she suffered at his hands. A ruptured eardrum, a separated shoulder and a broken leg were part of the pain during their 12-year marriage, <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Biesenbach </PERSON> said. On a hellish day in March 1988, her husband <PERSON> Max </PERSON> threatened to slice her throat with a butcher knife. Given his violent nature, Ms. <PERSON> Biesenbach </PERSON> believed him. She ended the nightmare by fatally shooting him in the driveway of their home on March 5, 1988. It was something she had tried to do at least twice. A state district judge in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> on Monday ordered Ms. <PERSON> Biesenbach </PERSON> to serve 10 years probation after she pleaded no contest to involuntary manslaughter. The plea was negotiated by defense attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> `` Racehorse'' <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>. `` Today, I do n't feel guilty anymore. I feel I did what I had to do to stay alive,'' Ms. <PERSON> Biesenbach </PERSON> said Tuesday in a telephone interview from her home in <LOCATION> Kerrville </LOCATION>, 70 miles northwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. `` I gave up. I did n't care. That's why I would n't accept even the word ` voluntary manslaughter.' I did n't plan that. I do n't know how I did it. It was through primitive brain _ self preservation,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Biesenbach </PERSON>, who has four children and seven grandchildren. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Biesenbach </PERSON>, 59, had threatened her as they drove home from dinner, she said. She had hidden a .357 - caliber Magnum revolver in their van, where she slept occasionally to escape his rage, she Before he could hurt her again, Ms. <PERSON> Biesenbach </PERSON> shot him three times in the chest. The killing followed years of abuse from a husband she described as a `` Jekyll-and-Hyde drinker.'' When he was sober, she said, he was as kind as <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>, taking his grandson fishing. Then he would turn violent in private, often after drinking heavily. `` It's indescribable, the hell that you live in,'' she said. `` You forget that there's another world out there with sunshine and love.'' Ms. <PERSON> Biesenbach </PERSON> tried to divorce her husband three times and went through with it once after he broke her leg, she said. But he always returned. At the time of the killing, they were married under common law. <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> said a trial, which could have lasted two weeks, would have been hard on Ms. <PERSON> Biesenbach </PERSON>. `` She would have had to relive that nightmare that was her existence with Mr. <PERSON> Biesenbach </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> said. However, he said he believes a jury would have acquitted her and that recent publicity about battered women would have helped her. `` I think all the national publicity has caused us to focus on it as something that for too long was kept behind closed doors,'' he said. State District Judge <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Priest </PERSON> accepted <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>' request that Ms. <PERSON> Biesenbach </PERSON> receive deferred adjudication, meaning that if probation requirements are met, there will be no record of guilt.

 <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was shot to death Tuesday in the same troubled neighborhood where he co-founded the militant <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 23 years ago to protect blacks from police violence. He was 47. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was found lying in a pool of blood in a rundown section of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> where residents fear they are losing the war against drug dealing and poverty. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, along with <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Seale </PERSON>, founded the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> to protect black neighborhoods against what they perceived as a pattern of police violence against blacks. The group was itself frequently associated with violence, although it also helped organize daycare centers, free breakfast programs, health clinics and a school in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, the party's minister of defense, was recalled as `` a person who rebelled against the status quo in all forms'' by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Rush </PERSON>, who once headed the Panther's <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> chapter. `` The Huey that I remember was a student of the world and ... made a contribution to the advancement of the ideals of freedom, justice and equality for all Americans.'' <PERSON> Rush </PERSON> said. `` I would like <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> to be remembered as a guy who took civil disobedience and put it on the cutting edge where heightened contradictions would come to light,'' <PERSON> Seale </PERSON>, now a community liaison with <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s African-American studies program. `` <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> and the Black Panther party were romantic symbols in the civil rights movement. Their operational style was provocative and dramatic,'' <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Innis </PERSON>, chairman of the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION>, or CORE. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was shot several times, including at least once in the head, according to Officer <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. The shooting was reported to police at 5:29 a.m., and <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was pronounced dead at <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> at 6:12 a.m., said Sgt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON>. Investigators swarmed the crime scene early Tuesday but declined to describe details of the shooting. At a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said there were no supects and no apparent motive in the slaying. `` At this point, there's no evidence to indicate that it was drug-related,'' said <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, adding that <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was found on his back. <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> DePalm </PERSON>, 29, who lives across the street from the site of the shooting, said she heard one shot about 5:15 a.m., followed seconds later by three more shots. Shooting is not uncommon in the neighborhood, Ms. <PERSON> DePalm </PERSON> said, but usually it is followed by yelling, screeching tires or other signs of a dispute. This time, she said, there was silence. Longtime residents recalled that <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> began his work with the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> in the same neighborhood, working with local churches to serve free breakfasts to youngsters. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Seale </PERSON> founded the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Self-Defense </ORGANIZATION> when a new militancy was taking hold among black youths impatient with the slow progress of the civil rights movement. Influenced by <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> X </PERSON>, <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Seale </PERSON> helped define the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> movement with their strident criticisms of police and the political establishment. They epitomized a new image for black youth, with their Afro haircuts, black leather jackets, black berets, pressed shirts, law books _ and guns. The Panthers frequently clashed with police. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, like other Panther leaders, accumulated a long criminal record, and was tried five times in two slayings. <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> in 1942, the youngest of seven children. His father, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> minister, moved the family to <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> a year later and took a job with the city Streets Department. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> attended several public schools in his early years and said he became aware early of white teacher prejudice against black students. Because black students often were in the slow-reading group, he said in a 1968 interview, `` blacks concluded that the whites were smart and they were dumb.'' `` To compensate for this lack of ability we saw in ourselves, we would say that whites were smarter but we were stronger,'' he said. `` We did n't understand that the white boys had gotten a head start from their families because many of them were middle-class, and through the experience of hearing their families exchange ideas over the dinner table they learned to cope with ideas. We, the blacks, did n't have this advantage.'' The black students, he said, learned to deal with white authorities by fighting them or outmanipulating them or skirting their rules, and that led to bitter confrontations with the police. He was convicted of manslaughter for the shooting death of an <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> policeman on Oct. 28, 1967, and was sentenced to two to 15 years. But that conviction was overturned on appeal after he served two years in prison. The charge was dropped after two retrials ended in hung juries. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s trial in the 1974 shooting death of a 17-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> prostitute also ended in a hung jury. A retrial ended in a hung jury. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in 1964, was convicted of being a felon in possession of weapons after a 1974 incident in which he allegedly pistol-whipped his tailor and police found two guns in his apartment. He then fled the country and lived for three years in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. He was acquitted of a charge of assault in connection with the incident.

 <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Orloff </PERSON>, deputy district attorney for <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> who prosecuted <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> in the 1974 case, called him `` a man who lived by violence and outside the law'' and `` nothing but a gangster.'' But others saw a different person. `` To us, <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was a hero,'' said <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> DePalm </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON>, who was awakened by the gunshots Tuesday morning. `` The Black Panthers were a thing to identify with, along with <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> X </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Garry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s lawyer for many years, hailed him as the founder of `` the renaissance of the black liberation movement.'' <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> said he never saw a violent side of <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>. `` I saw a very sweet side, a humane side a dignified side, a man who was theoretically in favor of a better world.'' <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> became paranoid and his personality changed years ago when he was targeted by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, whose agents tried to infiltrate and disrupt the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> through an operation known as COINTELPRO. The counterintelligence program, set up to destroy civil rights organizations, has been credited with _ or blamed for _ helping destroy the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION>. When <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> received a doctor of philosophy degree at age 38 from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, his dissertation was titled: `` War against the <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION>, a study of repression in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The Black Panthers eventually broke apart amid infighting, arrests, deaths, imprisonments and differing philosophies, especially between <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleaver </PERSON>, the one-time Panther information minister and author of `` Soul on Ice,'' who underwent a startling transformation into a born-again Christian and Republican. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> drew six months in jail after pleading no contest to misappropriating $ 15,000 in public money earmarked for a school the <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> ran in the early 1980s. He was already in jail at the time for parole violation. In 1969, Panthers <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> were killed in a pre-dawn police raid at their <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> headquarters. Police had ostenstibly been searching for weapons. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>'s relatives, and other survivors of the raid, successfully sued city, state and federal officials and were awarded $ 1.85 million in 1983. At one point, in 1977, the <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> flirted with conventionality when <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> and other Panther leaders accepted a resolution from two state assemblymen commending the <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> for their <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. The visit, which included an escorted tour of the state Capitol with 10 of the children, took place a decade after about 40 <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> marched through the Capitol on May 2, 1967, carrying loaded rifles, pistols and shotguns to protest a bill restricting the carrying of arms in public. The Panthers left the Capitol peacefully after guards confiscated the weapons, unloaded them and returned them. Twenty-four Panthers had been arrested that day on conspiracy charges, although no shots were fired and there were no injuries. Most charges were later dropped. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> did n't participate in the incident, but appeared at the arraignment, saying there was a `` conspiracy against the black world. ... We will not tolerate any more of this action. We'll let the consequences speak for themselves.'' During the more peaceful 1977 Capitol tour, <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> told reporters: `` Our basic goals and our basic ambitions have not changed. There has been some change in tactics.'' `` There are changes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, changes in awareness, but not in structure. ... We have always been dedicated to progressive change, and we're glad that other people are joining us.''

<TEXT>
 The cry was `` Get your red hots, comrade'' on Tuesday as the head of a fast food chain served up samples of the hot dogs his company plans to begin selling this fall in the heart of Red Square. For less than 1 -LCB- rubles _ about $ 2.25 _ a <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>'s Famous stand in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> GUM </ORGANIZATION> department store will sell hot dogs flown in from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and served on a Russian-made bun. `` <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>'s hot dogs have been hailed as a most succulent slice of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> democracy since they were first served in 1916 at <LOCATION> Coney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, and we are confident that Muscovite shoppers and tourists will feel that same sensation,'' chairman <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said. `` They'll be able for the first time to have at a reasonable price, quality food,'' <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said at a news conference at a <ORGANIZATION> Nathan </ORGANIZATION>'s Famous on Broadway, where he served free hot dogs to Soviets at the announcement and passers-by. <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goryachev </PERSON>, mayor of the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION>, credited perestroika _ <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive to restructure the Soviet economy _ with bringing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> fast food to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Soviet and <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>'s officials said the hot dog stand, which they hope to open by October, would be the first of its kind in the country. Pizza Hut and McDonald's also have plans to open outlets in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the officials said. `` What people will get is a different experience,'' <PERSON> Goryachev </PERSON> said through a translator. `` If they want to eat quickly they can eat quickly. If they do n't want to eat quickly they can go to a restaurant. Anything that they want they can have.'' <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Vladimirov </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> overseeing eateries in the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, said Soviets have a sausage similar to a hot dog, but it is breaded and fried. While probably not what <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> had in mind for his country when he led the Communist revolution of 1917, the joint venture would be good for both sides, <PERSON> Goryachev </PERSON> said. `` The main thing is that Americans and Russians are working together, eating together, and they will become friends,'' he said. And some of the capitalistic values of their new <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> friends apparently has already rubbed off. `` We wish you from our delegation a good spirit and to help people and to serve the people,'' <PERSON> Goryachev </PERSON> said in a toast. `` And most importantly, to have a profit.''

<TEXT>
 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said Tuesday the opposition made `` an historic error'' when it refused what he said was an offer to share in the government starting Sept. 1. Talks between the Noriega-controlled government and the opposition to resolve the country's political stalemate ended Monday with no solution in sight. The opposition refused an offer to form a joint government to rule after the current administration's term ends Sept. 1. And the government rejected the opposition demands that it recognize the opposition's claim that it won the May 7 elections and that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> step down as commander of the Defense Forces. `` More than was given can not be given,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said. `` They have committed an historic error. We offered half the government and they with the great economic capacity and with the support of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could have seized all the government. It was an error of idiots who were programmed to say no to everything.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> spoke after a military ceremony commemorating the return of the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION> military base to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1970. Both sides said they would await Wednesday's <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before deciding what action to take. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> arranged and mediated the talks, which have been held sporadically since mid-July. `` I insist, they were offered everything, absolutely everything, in an operation of goodwill on the part of the negotiators,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, a government representative to the talks `` offered more than he was authorized to offer, and that would have been a big problem for <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON>.'' Asked what <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> had offered, he said `` he was handing over half of all the government.'' International observers said opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> was ahead 3-1 in the May balloting when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had the election annulled. The opposition wants to take office Sept. 1 when the terms of Acting President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> and the legislative assembly expire. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said Monday the opposition did not agree to govern jointly because `` we are not going after power. They are offering part of the power. We are going after democracy, justice and freedom.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been using economic and diplomatic pressure to try to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down since he was indicted on federal narcotics trafficking charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in February 1988. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denies the charges and says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to avoid giving <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> full control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> at the end of 1999 as specified in 1977 treaties. `` It is an insult that foreign countries, that some foreign leaders, want to dictate to us what we have to do,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` That is humiliating. We are not a tribe. We know what we have to do.'' `` Here what we want is respect, nothing more,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.S. Checking into Problem of Contaminated Export Grain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Early detection of aflatoxin, a cancer-causing substance, prompted cancellation of some recent shipments of American corn to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspector has gone to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to check complaints of contaminated corn there, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Tuesday. The grain sent to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> under an American aid program in June was also inspected before leaving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and all samples tested free of aflatoxin contamination and fit for human consumption, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. After delivery, the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> complained of aflatoxin contamination to <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabranek </PERSON>, agricultural counselor of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. The embassy had no additional details but <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspector and other concerned American and Indian officials are thoroughly investigating the matter in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The report from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to recheck its samples of the shipment, confirming that the corn was uncontaminated at the time it left <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said. Aflatoxin is a potent carcinogen produced by a fungus during hot and dry weather that theoretically could materialize during shipment. The poison appeared in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the 1988 drought and again this year in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The Wall Street Journal said Tuesday the appearance of aflatoxin in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> could be an `` example of poisoned corn leaking through'' the inspection system or `` a case of the fungus producing aflatoxin after the grain had left <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. ports.'' The Journal said it obtained incomplete records showing that more than 24 million bushels -LRB- more than 600,000 metric tons -RRB- of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn exports, amounting to 24 shiploads, contained some contamination between October and April in what the newspaper described as a lax and imperfect inspection program. While confirming that intended destinations included <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said he had no additional information and asserted that the government would not knowingly permit shipment of contaminated grain cargo. He said reports from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> left many questions unanswered, such as how much of the almost 4 million bushels -LRB- 100,000 metric tons -RRB- of corn loaded for <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> arrived contaminated and what detection techniques were being used.

<TEXT>
 Sometimes, history is less than great events and memorable dates. Sometimes, it's coverlets and plows, soda bottles and signs. Sometimes, the commonplace is evidence of the past. `` A ` colored-only' sign makes a beautiful piece of history,'' said <PERSON> Alferdteen </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Margaret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alexander </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Put the sign up and it immediately communicates an era, a place,'' she said recently. `` See it now, it's completely out of character.'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> has used other less painful relics to depict black life in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> during the segregation era. Her work was the basis for `` Those That Stayed Home During the Great Migration 1915-Present,'' a companion exhibit to the traveling version of the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Field To Factory: Afro-American Migration 1915-1940.'' The exhibits opened Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robertson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> State are co-sponsoring the exhibits. Other activities associated with the exhibits include a national symposium on the `` Great Migration,'' Sept. 14-15 at <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>. While `` Field to Factory'' examines the forces that led 600,000 black Mississippians to move <PERSON> North </PERSON>, `` Those That Stayed Home'' looks at the lives of blacks who remained in the South. Both presentations tell their stories through ordinary objects essential to daily life. `` In my mind, it's three-dimensional objects that are remnants of people's lives that come before us,'' said <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Crew </PERSON>, curator of the Smithsonian exhibit. `` It's our way of beginning to see, feel and study that aspect of their lives.'' Over the years, the most pedestrian items have turned into historical treasures. `` The hardest thing to find was a broom that a factory janitor would use,'' <PERSON> Crew </PERSON> said, explaining that the broom illustrated the change in tools as workers went from planting crops to punching clocks. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, however, said she had no difficulty finding artifacts. Donations of items have flowed in since <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> mounted its first exhibit in the early 1980s. `` The museum caught on,'' she said. `` If people had kept up the effort, we would n't have a place to put stuff.'' One benefactor gave the entire contents of a country store, including a glass display case, empty bottles of <ORGANIZATION> Vernor </ORGANIZATION>'s Ginger Ale, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s Root Beer, and <PERSON> Orangette </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemonade </PERSON>, and a full bottle of 666 Tonic. Those bottles `` carry the essence of culture,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. `` Culture is the way people live from day to day. It's made up of technology, instututions, art and language.''

 <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it asked federal officials for details of charges that its pilots have been annoying air traffic controllers in an apparent protest over the pace of contract talks with the carrier. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> reported the trouble in a letter from <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON>, air traffic manager at <LOCATION> Greater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, to <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> pilots. `` I have never been so concerned about our working relationship with professional aviators as I am now,'' <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> wrote. The trouble apparently began Aug. 5, the day <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> merged with <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s 6,000 pilots have been working under an extension of their old contract for the last year. <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> jets have taxied at unusually slow speeds and pilots have blocked or slowed communications with the tower. Pilots also have insisted on using bad weather landing procedures in good weather, requiring controllers to space planes farther apart, and they have reduced airspeed without first notifying the tower, he said. <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> said his Aug. 10 letter `` was an appeal to their professionalism. My controllers are frustrated.'' The job actions were not a threat to safety, <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> said, because `` there are not enough pilots participating. If it was more widespread we'd be concerned about safety. Right now it's more of an annoyance to controllers.'' <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> said the airline's flight records show no evidence of concerted action by pilots He said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of flying, asked the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to provide the airline with details that might help identify pilots. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> he was shocked and dismayed by the reports. `` While I understand some of our pilots are unhappy with the progress of our current contract negotiations, I fully expect them to continue to conduct themselves in the professional manner that you have long grown accustomed to,'' he said in a letter. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazor </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he was unaware of any slowdown order for members at <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> was fined $ 2,000 last month after its pilots were caught deliberately jamming conversations between the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> tower and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilots. The pilots' union is striking Eastern.

 White House officials appeared to close the door on any possibility of sending troops to help <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> fight drug traffickers Tuesday as the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation moved to extradite one man who faces drug charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Asked for a second day about reports that the administration was considering sending military help to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said simply, `` It's not going to happen.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, vacationing at his seaside resort home, telephoned Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> on Monday night to express condolences on the assassination of presidential candidate <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, reported to have been gunned down by drug traffickers. In that conversation <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> specifically said he did not want <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to get involved, according to <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The Bush-Barco conversation and further statements from White House officials on Tuesday squelched earlier suggestions from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself and Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might be considering military troops as an option if <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> requested such aid. Barco has made no such request, nor did he seek non-military aid to deal withhis country's heightening drug-related crisis, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON>. She said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was working on the extradition matter, following Barco's action easing procedures that have impeded extraditions to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1988. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> named the `` Dozen Most Wanted'' alleged Colombian drug traffickers that it would like to extradite, including the leadership of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Cali </PERSON> cocaine cartels. The list did not include an alleged major money-launderer, <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>. Colombian authorities said they had arrested <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> where he is suspected of being a financial chief of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel. Colombian national police said they started proceedings Tuesday to extradite him. Ms. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue its current support to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, including U.S.-made helicopters, <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> agents to work with <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> officials, and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> advisers to the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> military. She denied reports the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is sending a special team of security experts to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, saying, `` We're not aware of any team going there.'' Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity had said the administration was preparing to send security experts to advise judges, magistrates and journalists _ groups who have been targets of drug gangs _ on how to improve security. A $ 5 million program along those lines was approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over a year ago. The developments on the international drug scene came as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was getting word from a new poll that Americans approve of his handling of anti-drug efforts even before the official announcement next month of the administration's anti-drug strategy. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll said respondents in a sample of 1,509 people questioned by telephone Aug. 17 to Aug. 21 approved of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s anti-drug efforts, 54 percent to 40 percent. The poll said it had a likely margin of error of three percentage points either way. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, on an extended vacation with family members, continued his holiday pattern of jogging, tennis and boating. His wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, however, returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for an eye examination due to continuing eye irritation stemming from Graves disease, a thyroid imbalance. Doctors at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> switched her medication from cortisone to prednisone because her eye symptoms had not improved. They said her thyroid problem was under control. The president told reporters who jogged with him that his wife's eyes had been bothering her again, although she felt fine otherwise Aides said she suffered double vision, despite treatment earlier this year with radioactive iodine. In late morning, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> piloted his speedboat <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>, filled with several of his children and grandchildren, close to the shore by the hotel that houses the traveling press working area. He stopped and called across the water to a small group that gathered on the rocky shore, chatting about the beautiful weather and his plans to spend most of the day on the water. He had his fishing gear with him. When he said the water temperature was nice, reporters asked if he wanted to repeat his impromptu leap into the sea that he performed Saturday on a dare from his children. The president declined.

 War is hell, but peace is n't any easier, particularly if you're a member of a British army entertainment unit presenting a tacky `` Jungle Jamboree'' to the troops in <LOCATION> Malaya </LOCATION> in 1948. Out of such show biz misery comes `` Privates on Parade,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>' quasi-autobiographical remembrances of British imperialism in decline after World War II. The play with music, which opened Tuesday at off-Broadway's Roundabout Theater, is a gloriously funny evening of caustic social and political commentary interspersed with hilarious song and dance And `` Privates on Parade'' works on both levels. <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> tweaks the nose of the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> establishment, personified in the play by Maj. <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> <PERSON> Flack </PERSON>, who wo n't let anything _ not even the theater _ interfere with <PERSON> God </PERSON> and country. <PERSON> Flack </PERSON>, played by the unflappable and marvelously comic <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, stands in contrast to his charges, members of <LOCATION> SADUSEA </LOCATION>, Song and Dance Unit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. They may have been drafted unwillingly into show business but once on stage, ca n't get it out of their blood. The play chronicles the adventures of this ragtag bunch of performers, particularly the young and impressionable Pvt. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Flowers </PERSON>, played with just the right amount of innocence and earnest righteousness by <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fyfe </PERSON>. It's Flowers' introduction, indoctrination and assimilation into the troupe that takes up much of the action in `` Privates on Parade.'' The performers are led by Acting Capt. <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, a flamboyant, frustrated musical comedy star, played on the edge of manic outrageousness by <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> is a music hall marvel. He has a rapport not only with the other performers but with the audience as well. It's <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> who gets most of the musical turns, decimating in drag such campy icons as <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietrich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>. He also does a devastating turn as <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Coward </PERSON> wondering why things have turned out so rotten even though the Allies won the war. <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>' lyrics, when they can be heard in the Roundabout's sound-deadening auditorium, are witty The music by <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> affectionately echoes the old songs he is spoofing. And there's one little rouser, a catchy title tune that begins as a march and ends in a high-kicking chorus line fashioned by choreographer <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelzig </PERSON>. The play's nearly two dozen scenes blend fluidly into each other. Director <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> uses a front cloth, much like a curtain in old vaudeville theaters, to separate scenes as well as the musical numbers from the dramatic action. <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, author of `` Joe Egg,'' another fine Roundabout production, has been generous to the other actors in the play. Each gets a chance to shine, particularly <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>, as the troupe's one decent member who understands what the British have done wrong in <LOCATION> Malaya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickell </PERSON> as a foul-mouthed corporal, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hibbert </PERSON> as the world's most inept magician and <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, the company's sole female and love interest for young Flowers. For all its comedy, `` Privates on Parade'' has a serious _ and violent _ side <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> does n't let the audience forget the consequences of British rule, not only for the ruled but for the rulers themselves. The play was first done in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 1977 and had its American premiere at the Long Wharf Theater in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> four years ago. Why it has taken so long to get to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is anybody's guess. Just be grateful that `` Privates on Parade'' has finally arrived.

 The Voyager 2 spacecraft found at least one complete ring of debris orbiting <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, surprising scientists who discovered it while trying to relocate a partial ring dubbed the `` lost arc,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Two partial rings _ called ring arcs _ appeared in pictures <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> made Aug. 11 as it approached the solar system's fourth largest planet, but the arc that orbits 17,000 miles above <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s cloudtops could n't be found in subsequent images, prompting researchers to dub it the lost arc or `` ghost arc. When scientists rediscovered it in a series of 16 photographs sent back Tuesday, `` It seemed reasonable that this was indeed the lost arc our imaging team raiders were looking for,'' team leader <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` But instead of being an arc, it turns out to be a complete circle, a complete ring. ... It goes all the way around _ <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s first complete ring,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said during a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory The new photos also show the second and larger arc, which orbits 23,300 miles above <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s cloudtops, extends farther around <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> than previously believed, suggesting that it also may be a complete ring, but with `` regions of greater and lesser amounts of material in it,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. He said the answer may not come until <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s ring system is photographed while backlighted by distant sunlight. That will happen after Voyager makes its closest approach to <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> by passing 3,000 miles over the planet's north pole cloudtops at 8:55 p.m. PDT Thursday. Voyager already has discovered four Neptunian moons in addition to Nereid and backward-orbiting <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, which were discovered from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Asked if Voyager has found more moons, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> replied: `` Suspects have been seen here and there. ... I would expect several more satellites -LRB- moons -RRB-.'' By 9 a.m. PDT Wednesday, <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> will be 2.747 billion miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and 1.386 million miles from <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, speeding toward the giant planet at 37,855 mph. The spacecraft has traveled a curving 4.4-billion-mile path since it was launched in 1977. Voyager's activity list Tuesday included taking 39 more photos to look for ring arcs or rings, six photos of the recently discovered moon 1989 N1; 22 images of <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> and 66 pictures of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s surprisingly active weather patterns, which include a variety of clouds, 400-mph winds and an Earth-sized cyclone called the Great Dark Spot The spaceship also was programmed to make 73 ultraviolet images of the planet, some of them to look for southern and northern lights, or auroras, created as electrons are sucked toward <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s poles along magnetic field lines Voyager also used a light sensor Tuesday to look for variations in <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s surface brightness, providing clues to the moon's structure and makeup The moon's polar icecaps may extend to the equator during winter at each pole, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the moon may have snowstorms of frozen methane, or natural gas, at times. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON>'s infrared sensor was measuring heat patterns near <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s poles in an attempt to understand the planet's turbulent weather The discovery of at least one complete ring around <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> was surprising. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said two months ago that the planet might be orbited by 50 to 100 partial rings of debris. He backed away from that prediction Tuesday, saying it was based on the possibility that the gravitational pull of some still-undiscovered moon, inclined out of the planet's equatorial plane, might `` shepherd'' dozens of rings arcs. Instead, it looks like two of the moons discovered by <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> might be shepherds for the complete ring and ring arc. Both moons orbit the planet's equator. Scientists had said ring arcs could be the remnants of moons torn apart by gravitational forces or collisions. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said it is n't yet known if the ring material seen so far consists of boulder -, pebble - or dust-sized

 A giant elevator on the USS <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> ruptured a hydraulic line during an open house Tuesday, spraying oily fluid on visitors and sparking a panic that caused dozens of injuries. The rupture caused the elevator, one of four on the aircraft carrier capable of hoisting bomb-laden jets, to come to an immediate stop, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Etter </PERSON>, a ship's officer, said. The jolt and spray of hydraulic fluid caused riders to panic and stampede off the platform, he said. `` Panic seems to have been what caused most of the problems and injuries,'' <PERSON> Etter </PERSON> said. He added that he had never before seen such a hydraulic problem with the elevator, which is designed to carry up to 120,000 pounds. There were an estimated 60 people on the elevator platform and about 30 suffered some kind of injury, said <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanza </PERSON>, district supervisor of <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s emergency medical services. Two people were admitted to <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Klaer </PERSON>, 61, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, complained of chest pains, and <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, 61, of <LOCATION> Margate </LOCATION>, had a possible stroke. Both were listed in fair condition Tuesday night, said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Biles </PERSON>. The rest of the injured were treated for minor bumps and bruises, and had hydraulic fluid flushed from their eyes in the ship's infirmary, <PERSON> Lanza </PERSON> said `` It happened so quickly _ one minute we were riding the elevator and the next it was a stampede,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Boehm </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. `` All of a sudden we heard this loud hissing noise and people started running and pushing to get away from it,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Nitsch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. `` I did n't see anyone seriously injured, but we were all scared to death.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> quickly canceled the day's tours on the ship and evacuated all civilians on board. Officers did n't say immediately whether the planned two-day open house would resume Wednesday. The ship, which is the length of 3 -LCB- football fields and carries a crew of about 3,000 sailors, docked Monday at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. The JFK is the world's largest steam-powered aircraft carrier.

 Tau <PERSON> Kappa </PERSON> <PERSON> Epsilon </PERSON>, the nation's largest college social fraternity, announced Tuesday that it had ended pledging in an effort to stop dangerous hazing, making it the second fraternity in a week to do so. `` Hazing has long been a problem in the fraternity system,'' said <PERSON> T.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitz </PERSON>, the fraternity's executive vice president. `` We have tried numerous programs to eradicate it from the fraternity, but so far none have accomplished the task.'' Legislation banning pledging was passed by undergraduate delegates from the fraternity's more than 280 chapters during the 45th national convention here last weekend. Instead of a pledge period, new TKE recruits will be initiated immediately. TKE has more than 177,000 initiated members and 16,000 active undergraduate members. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Zeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tau </ORGANIZATION> announced that it was eliminating the traditional pledge period. Pledging evolved in the late 19th century and was meant to be a rite of passage for new recruits before their initiation as full members.

 Nine children lived as virtual prisoners in a dark, filthy apartment where they were sexually or physically assaulted by their parents, authorities said Tuesday. There may have been three other children who did not survive their first month and were secretly buried. `` There were 11 people living in a darkened apartment with little access to the outside world. They only knew this way of life. They were not born in a hospital, they were born in the apartment,'' said Deputy Chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMartino </PERSON>. It appeared that the eldest girl, 14, was the only one who had ever gone to school, he said. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, 42 and 34 respectively, were arrested Monday after three months of delicate questioning of the children disclosed a pattern of rape, sodomy and beatings in three gloomy rooms from which the six boys and three girls never emerged. The children were taken from their parents three months ago. `` The oldest children suffered most from the sexual abuse and the younger children from physical abuse,'' <PERSON> DeMartino </PERSON> said. Police dug up a slope where <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> told police he had buried two infants. No bodies were found Tuesday. Police said they believed those two children were born within the last 3 -LCB- years and died at less than a month of age, but whether of violence, disease or neglect was not known. `` We have no reason at this point to believe they were killed by the parents,'' said <PERSON> DeMartino </PERSON>. `` They disposed of the bodies.'' The last of the missing children may have been stillborn, <PERSON> DeMartino </PERSON> said. Police and city welfare officials went to the <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>'s one-bedroom apartment in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> borough of <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> on May 25 in response to neighbors' complaints that the children were being neglected. `` When the people went into the apartment, they found it to be extremely dark,'' <PERSON> DeMartino </PERSON> said. `` No electricity, filthy, strewn with dirty clothing and newspapers. ... Windows covered with dirty rags and sheets and the children appeared frightened and dirty.'' Welfare officials immediately took the children _ boys of 16, 12, 10, 5 and 2 years and a 4-month-old, and girls of 14, 8 and 6 years. Detectives returned for the parents Monday. They arrested the father on two counts of rape, four of sodomy, 13 of felonious assault, two of incest, two of reckless endangerment, nine of endangering the welfare of a minor and one of sexual abuse. The mother was charged with two assaults and nine endangerings. `` We do n't have any information that they were hyperreligious, cultish,'' said <PERSON> DeMartino </PERSON>. `` He was protective of his family. He believed his way of life was best, that he knew best how to educate his children ... `` They were recluses. The husband would come and go occasionally. The wife remained in the apartment. The children remained in the apartment. They did little or nothing,'' he said. <PERSON> DeMartino </PERSON> said that although the building was a known drug location, there was no evidence of narcotics in the apartment. Neighbors said <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> never spoke and ignored greetings as he came and went in the building. The children were heard but rarely seen. A man next door said that if any of the children looked out the kitchen window, <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> `` would grab them back and used to hit the kids and beat them.'' <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, originally from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, did occasional work as a laborer and received $ 554 a month from Social Security, the chief said. His wife came from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. It was not known how long they have lived in the city.

 Police said they arrested five suspects Tuesday night in the assassination of leading presidential candidate <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> at a campaign rally. Authorities have blamed cocaine traffickers for his death. The five were presented to local reporters at national police headquarters and shown on television. They were dressed in casual, well-worn clothing. All five are Colombians, police said, and identified them as <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernal </PERSON> <PERSON> Acosta </PERSON>, <PERSON> Norberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Morillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Charalca </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Zembrano </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON>, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Chacon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jubis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazvumb </PERSON>. Police said the five men were arrested at a downtown apartment. No other details were given. Police also announced that proceedings began Tuesday to extradite a purported manager of drug money to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he faces conspiracy charges involving a billion-dollar money-laundering scheme. Authorities reported more raids and seizures on the fourth day of their nationwide crackdown on the drug underworld. The country's judges planned to return to their duties, ending a strike called after a judge and police official were killed Thursday The extradition of <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, said to manage funds for the notorious <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, was seen as a test of a government pledge to hand over cocaine traffickers wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The powerful cocaine cartels have cowed the courts in the past through a systematic campaign of terror. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> escaped arrest last spring in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on the day <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials announced his indictment in connection with the drug-laundering scheme. The indictment followed an investigation which resulted in charges against 127 people and two Latin American banks. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is moving to extradite <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, even though his name was not on a list of the `` Dozen Most Wanted'' drug traffickers <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> sent Tuesday to the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government. The list focused on the leaders of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cali </ORGANIZATION> cartels. On Tuesday, columnist <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> expressed the public's outrage at the Friday murder of Sen. <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, an outspoken foe of the drug lords `` The killing of <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> has to be the drop that makes the cup overflow'' and end the terror that has paralyzed the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> establishment, he wrote in the daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION>. `` Let the country's bloody assassins know that the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> state indeed can fight them with energy and will. Officials said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was being held under strict security at the headquarters of the national police department's judicial investigations division. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was captured in a weekend raid on a rural estate at <LOCATION> Tolu </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast 550 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. Police said he offered no resistance. In an interview with a local reporter, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said: `` At no time have I had links to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel and I do n't know any of its members.'' Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmona </PERSON>, chief of the judicial investigations division, said the extradition process began Tuesday with the dispatch of notes to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> informing them of the arrest. Radio reports, quoting unidentified government sources, said officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s office were drawing up specific procedures for handing <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> One of several emergency measures Barco announced Friday gave his government the authority to extradite drug dealers without judicial review, relieving the besieged judiciary of responsibility. Since 1981, assassins working for the cocaine barons have killed 220 judges, magistrates and judicial aides. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> would be the first drug suspect sent to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1987, when the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nullified an extradition treaty that had been used to deliver 14 purported drug dealers.

 Prosecutors said Wednesday they have enough evidence to indict the leader of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s largest opposition party in connection with a legislator's secret trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. A statement issued by the prosecutor's office said it will decide whether to bring formal charges against <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> after further investigation. Prosecution sources said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, would not be physically detained. `` Should the prosecution indict me, I will fight squarely in court,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> told reporters. `` I am innocent and I expect truth to be established.'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> was released early Wednesday following 15 hours of interrogation, the second time in three weeks he has faced questioning about the illegal trip to communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by National Assemblyman <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-won </PERSON>. Prosecutors said they have enough evidence to indict <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> on grounds he knew about <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>'s August 1988 trip to North two months before the case was made public in June 1989. They said they also have evidence he received $ 10,000 from <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> who had received the money from North Korean agents. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> has vigorously denied the allegations and accused the government of harassment and trying to embarrass and discredit his party. The statement issued by the prosecutor's office said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Won-ki </PERSON>, the party's floor leader who was questioned Tuesday, may also be indicted in the Suh case. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>, who was arrested June 28, has been charged with espionage, violating a ban on unauthorized travel to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and receiving $ 120,000 from communist agents. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>, a 52-year-old farmer elected to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in April 1988, was expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> after his trip to the north was made public. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government prohibits unauthorized visits to the North and failure to report knowledge of such a trip is also a crime. Prosecutors quoted <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> as admitting he met with North Korean President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> in August 1988 and giving $ 10,000 to <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The prosecutors also claimed that <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> in mid-April told <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> about his secret trip. That would be two months earlier than <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said he was informed. Lawyers who belong to the opposition party said <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> was forced to make a false confession to incriminate the party leader.

 Hurricane <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> posed a danger to ships in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> on Tuesday, but had little chance of reaching land with its 75 mph winds, forecasters said.

The storm was moving west-northwest at about 12 mph.

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on Tuesday compared the killing of Palestinian collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to the slaying of Europeans who aided <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> occupation forces during World War II. He also hinted that the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> would reconsider its policies if what he called `` Israeli crimes'' continue, but said the organization stands by its peace proposals. Asked at a news conference about increasing <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> attacks on purported collaborators in the Israeli-occupied territories <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> responded: `` Are you against it? Are you against it?'' `` They are quislings, those who are coordinating with our enemies.'' `` How many quislings were killed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> during the Nazi occupation? And even after the withdrawal, you remember what happened in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>?'' he asked, referring to attacks on French people who collaborated with German forces during World War II. But he said Arabs collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should be given a chance to repent and should be singled out for punishment only by the Palestinian leadership, not individuals. Arabs have slain 97 Palestinians accused as collaborators during the 20 months of the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. Israeli troops and settlers have killed at least 545 Palestinians during the uprising and 38 Israelis have perished. The underground leadership of the uprising this month accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of trying to divide Palestinians by inspiring leaflets that falsely accused <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> patriots of being collaborators. Among those accused was <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Executive Committee member <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Milhem </PERSON>, who sat near <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on Tuesday and helped translate his remarks. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> Sunday and held talks with King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and senior aides.

 <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Pytka </PERSON>'s name might be unfamiliar to moviegoers, but his commercials certainly are n't. From <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'s short-lived <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> spot -LRB- `` Go ahead, make a wish'' -RRB- to <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s celebrity-filled <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> plug -LRB- `` Just do it'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Pytka </PERSON>'s TV ads rattle with vivid visuals of his eclectic, offbeat style But in making a movie _ `` Let It Ride,'' starring <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> _ the attention-grabbing director had to tone it down and make his bold camera work disappear. `` In a commercial, you kind of grab people by the back of the neck and shove them in,'' said <PERSON> Pytka </PERSON>, who also directed the `` Dirty Diana'' and `` The Way You Make Me Feel'' music videos for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` In commercials, I become a performer for my clients,'' he said. `` In a film, I was just one of the crew. I was invisible on this film. In a film, you have to let people participate. I think that films that tend to be bombastic wear you out before they're over.'' `` Let It Ride'' is a comedy about a compulsive gambler named <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotter </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> -RRB- who has a really good day at the races. Joining <PERSON> Trotter </PERSON> at the track are his unlucky pal, <LOCATION> Looney </LOCATION> -LRB- <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON>, also known as the musician <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> -RRB-, and his frustrated wife, <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Teri </PERSON> <PERSON> Garr </PERSON> -RRB-. The movie also co-stars <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. At 90 minutes, `` Let It Ride'' runs substantially longer than any commercial or music video <PERSON> Pytka </PERSON> has made. Among other things, the 11 weeks of filming showed him that the movie business operates on an entirely different level than the ad world. `` The level of performing you work with in a film like this is so far beyond what would be available to you in a commercial,'' <PERSON> Pytka </PERSON> said. `` Most commercials are populated by models and attractive people. They're not actors. `` Commercial spots are usually cast visually. You cast stereotypically in a commercial _ somebody has to look like somebody because you only have 30 seconds and that's it. You cast businessmen who look like businessmen; mothers who look like mothers. And the performance is usually just one note; you do n't have climaxes and you do n't have to work with range. `` Here, the care and feeding of the performer is the primary concern. This is a performance film, totally. This film will live and die on the merits of its performance.'' In its first weekend of release, `` Let It Ride'' failed to make a killing at the box office. It debuted at No. 12 on the charts, grossing $ 1.9 million. <PERSON> Pytka </PERSON> said he has wanted to make a dramatic feature films for years. `` I started out doing documentaries, and I got frustrated,'' he said. `` A film is the natural extension of any desire to work in film. It's the ultimate for an actor, it's the ultimate for a filmmaker. `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> was attached to the project when the script was given to me. And you do n't turn down an opportunity to work with a person of that caliber. For me, as a first-time film director, to be able to work with somebody like <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> is a thing you do n't turn down.'' Though pleased with his debut performance, <PERSON> Pytka </PERSON> is bothered that movies invite far less daring than commercials. `` I would love to do a film like my commercials,'' he said. `` But you ca n't get surreal in films too much. Filmmaking is a public art. It needs a big public response. `` I just did a commercial where these lumberjacks are being chased by a yeti. They run into their truck. Their truck is too small to carry them all. So they get out of the truck, they pull on the truck and stretch it into a bigger truck, get into the truck and drive away. `` The yeti just misses them and kicks the dirt. That is surreal. When you try to do something like that -LRB- in the movies -RRB- it does n't get a response.

 He's at it again, trumpeting the beginning of the end, `` the rapture.'' <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> misdated it before, incorrectly exciting a lot of people. But now he's touting a new deadline _ next Friday. `` Everything points to it,'' says the retired <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> rocket engineer. `` All the evidence has piled up.'' This time, however, warning criticisms were being sounded against buying his revised end-time scenario, although there were indications of another Bible Belt surge of attention to it. Heavy circulation of <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON>'s new, 96-page book, `` The Final Shout: Rapture Report _ 1989,'' was reported across the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, in many cases in free mailings by the <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, publisher, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` The time is short,'' says <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON>. `` I'm telling people the end is near and to get their children and everyone they care about under the blood of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> interfaith witness department, issued a paper urging people not to be deceived by <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON>'s `` rapture'' predictions. `` Whisenant builds his predictions upon misinterpretation, misapplication and conjecture,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> says. `` He constantly takes Scriptural passages out of context and gives them meanings which the biblical writers would find strange.'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> says <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON>'s book reads more like an `` Indiana Jones'' movie than good theology. <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON>, 56, of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview, `` I do n't care what they call me, or what they say about me as long as they've heard what I'm telling them. `` Like <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON>, they can believe it or not. They do n't have to be surprised when it happens unless they choose to be. `` If I did n't tell them, then their blood would be on my hands. God would hold me accountable. No matter what they say, I'll say what I think even if it kills me when I believe it's the truth and it's important. `` I'm giving it my best shot. Win, lose or draw, I'm home free with God.'' <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON>, formerly a Kennedy Space Center electrical engineer involved in the early rocket launches and moon-landing program, retired in 1968. He said he has concentrated since then on analyzing biblical prophecy. `` It's an obsession,'' he said. `` But it's not an ego trip. It's a fear trip, the fear of God. He first gained public notice with his small book, `` 88 Reasons Why the Rapture Will Be in l988,'' with a reported 4.5 million copies sold or given away. <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> said he was mistaken in setting the date as September 1988, chiefly because his mathematical calculations were off by one year due to a quirk in the modern Gregorian calendar. Comments <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>: `` The amazing thing is that so many Christians took him seriously.'' Citing reports indicating another huge distribution of the revised prognostications, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> says: `` The Lord <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> will come again when the Father chooses and not according to Mr. <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON>'s timetable.'' <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> said he previously failed to consider that the calendar counts only 99 years in the first century, beginning with A.D. 1 instead of a zero year. Other centuries begin with a zero year, such as 1900. He said that detail, plus a maze of other numerical computations and allusions from Scripture and historical events, put the date ahead to this coming Sept. 1, 1989. `` I'm confident about it, more strongly than before,'' he said, adding that he was 96 percent certain, with the other 4 percent allotted to the next four years up to 1993. He said he had concluded that last year actually was intended as a preliminary notice or shout that `` the Bridgegoom cometh,'' as mentioned in Matt: 25:1 -13, before actually appearing `` This shout gave God's people a one-year awakening so they would be ready,'' <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> said. At the `` rapture,'' he said, 40 million born-again Christians will undergo an instantaneous chemical body change, their new bodies able to appear and disappear and pass through walls. He said they'll remain on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> up to nine days before joining <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> in heaven's third level after which there will be seven years of earthly tribulation, including three nuclear wars before a final Armageddon. At that point, he said, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> will descend with his angels, victorious in the final war, and beginning a 1,000-year reign of peace and prosperity before the Last Judgment. <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> said his book last year earned $ 5.5 million for the publisher, but he himself took no royalty. `` I'll get all my reward in heaven,'' he said. He said it's OK if the publisher prefers rewards in this world, adding: `` I'll take mine in the next. I do n't think I'm wrong. I've put my life on it. I just believe the Bible, the way it's written... Get your heart right with <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. It's like picking up a thousand-dollar bill on the sidewalk. It's that simple.''

Rounding out the band are <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> on guitar, <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Fig </PERSON> playing drums, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> as keyboardist and frontman. Together and individually they have developed a devoted following, almost cult-like. `` We get quite a lot of mail,'' said the drummer in the band's dressing room, which is just large enough for a small couch and water cooler `` Especially this guy,'' interjected <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, indicating Fig. `` He gets mail, he gets clothes, he gets trailer houses. Some woman sent him a casino one time. He's doing great.'' <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> himself is also a genuine fan. `` He loves musicians. And airline pilots. And professional sportsmen,'' said Fig. `` They're the most entertaining and best part of the show each night,'' <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` The band is always a constant source of energy regardless of whatever else goes tumbling down.'' The band is an integral element of the one-hour talk show. Although they play music for a total of four to five minutes, the band creates a mood. Their `` break tunes,'' going into and coming out of commercials, raise the energy level of the studio audience. Often, the songs are chosen on the spur of the moment to play off a remark made by <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> or a guest. Sometimes the right song is one they've never played before. `` We have a basic song list that we fall back on. But through the whole show we're whispering over there,'' said <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON>, who is seen most nights wearing his yellow and black sneakers that match the bumble bee color scheme of his guitar. The band also plays with the show's healthy spectrum of musical guests: from the Bee Gees to <ORGANIZATION> Iggy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pop </ORGANIZATION>, Yma Sumac to <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>. In one week `` Late Night'' had <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Townshend </PERSON> and XTC. `` We all have to do our homework and play like we're in that band,'' said <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON>, whose bespectacled <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> look dates from his days arranging music for `` Saturday Night Live.'' `` Our duty is to back up the artists. We dissect the record, see what style we have to play each day.'' Band members receive tapes of the chosen performers the day before that particular show, but there's usually little time for group rehearsal outside the roughly 45 minutes the band has with the featured guest before taping begins at 5:30 p.m. -LRB- The show, in its eighth season, airs weeknights at 12:30 a.m. EDT. -RRB- `` It's getting easier _ it's like, listen to the song on the way to the show and you got it,'' said Fig. The `` Late Night'' band is active off camera, performing at various festivals, concerts, and with artists such as <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Summer </PERSON>, Was Not Was, The <ORGANIZATION> Neville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oates </PERSON>. They even did a wedding. `` It was a favor to a good friend,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. `` And we needed the rehearsal.'' `` We played the set we were going to play the next night for our concert,'' added Fig. `` The wedding was sort of incidental.'' That concert was their first live recording for two songs on <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON>'s debut album, `` Coast To Coast,'' released this month on Capitol Records. <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> collaborated with artists he admired, including the members of the World's Most Dangerous Band, producing music ranging from guitar rock to blues, surfing instrumentals to `` a marriage of doo-wop and hip-hop.'' Guest artists include <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dion </PERSON>, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Maestro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Toussaint </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Womack </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and The Fresh Prince. `` Maybe so many of them did the album because they could hear themselves in my music,'' speculated <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON>. `` They understood what I was doing.''

<TEXT>
 Among the affects of Public Law 100-418, which is supposed to enhance American competitiveness, is to convert the nation's forests into massive piles of studies that few people will read. As those paper mountains grow, so will the bureaucracy needed to tend them _ to store them and index them, for example, and to exhume them now and again for seminars and conferences that produce nothing These are some of the results of the law, whose full identification is the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. In the name of competitiveness and the furtherance of it, the law contains at least 272 reporting and paperworks requirements. It mandates new studies, reports, advisory committees, interagency groups, meetings, seminars and conferences `` to feed the insatiable curiosity of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The phrase in quotations marks is from <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Weidenbaum </PERSON>, chief economic adviser in the early months of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. He is appalled at the legislation, which he says would flunk a truth-in-labeling test. After reading the 467-page law, <PERSON> Weidenbaum </PERSON> describes it as `` an example of the inability of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to control itself.'' Under the guise of dealing with competitiveness, he says, it responded to pressure groups and idle curiosities. It also reversed the recent trend toward reducing the federal paperwork burden. `` Ecologists should mourn for all the trees that will be cut down to provide paper for what will literally be an endles array of studies,'' he says <PERSON> Weidenbaum </PERSON> now heads the Center for the Study of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, an academic-type institution at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, that affords him the time to indulge in a study of the massive document. While in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he never could have done so. He does n't think many of those now there will either. For the president alone, he says, the law dictates four one-time reports, two periodic reports, two open-ended reports and two new committees. Is this the way to increase American competitiveness, he asks? Such a burden is awesome, he says, and he suggests it becomes depressing to dwell on the possibility, indeed the likelihood, that many of those reports will never be read, especially by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who demanded them. Every time the president makes a trade agreement with a foreign country he must _ in addition to telling <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> what if anything they must do to implement the agreement _ send them a report on efforts he has made to obtain international exchange rate equilibrium. The report must also indicate what effect the agreement will have on `` increased international monetary stability.'' In addition, his report must describe the extent to which any country signing the agreement maintains a `` noncommercial state trading enterprise'' that may impair <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> benefits. The law is an omnibus, to be sure, adding new duties to the Departments of Agriculture, commerce, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, Education, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, State and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. It involves the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Under the guise of dealing with trade and competitiveness, the statute responds to `` all sorts of pressure groups and personal curiosities of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' says <PERSON> Weidenbaum </PERSON>. In quite a few instances, he adds, it appears that <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> approval of new studies are little more than consolation prizes for members whose substantive legislative proposals were rejected. The Secretary of Agriculture must study the market for lamb in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. If appropriate, `` the report should include proposals on ways to bring about a long-term increase in per capita consumption of lamb meat products.'' The law, concludes <PERSON> Weidenbaum </PERSON>, `` illustrates the unrestrained nature of congressional mandates at a time when national policy ostensibly is to focus on improving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efficiency and productivity.'' He asks: `` Can the taxpayer expect the members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to read the detailed reports they require?'' Good question. Obvious answer. If they were to be so industrious as to read these reports they'd have little time for anything else. But maybe they should. Maybe that's the way to prevent more omnibus laws from getting passed.

<HEAD>Baptists And Catholics Find Basic Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Southern Baptists and Roman Catholics, the nation's two largest denominations, generally have been regarded as doctrinally far apart, but their scholars find they basically agree. Despite varied terminology and some real differences, `` we do share a basic understanding of what it means to be followers of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> by the grace of God,'' says their joint report. After 10 years of periodic discussions, the Baptist-Catholic dialogue group, quoting Ephesians 4:5, concludes, `` We not only confessed but experienced ` One Lord, one faith and one baptism.''' The 163-page report is seen as the most full-scale, mutual examination of respective positions of the two traditions. Achieving it was an unprecedented experience for <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptists </ORGANIZATION>, commonly averse to ecumenical affairs. Both sides admitted past unfairness toward each other, with predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> countries discriminating against Southern Baptist missionaries and the latter laboring among Catholics without respecting their faith. Such `` competition and conflict'' in missionary work `` can become a stumbling block to those who have not heard the gospel,'' the dialogue team said. Its report was issued recently in a special issue of `` Theological Educator,'' a journal of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION>, and in a book called `` To Understand Each Other,'' published by <ORGANIZATION> Paulist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphreys </PERSON>, a Southern Baptist theologian and participant in the dialogue, said it was a rare process for his denomination, which generally has shunned ecumenical efforts for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> unity. The talks, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecumenical </ORGANIZATION> and Interreligious Affairs and the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interfaith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witness </ORGANIZATION>, involved 18 meetings beteen 1978 and 1988. There were about 20 participants in each meeting, but due to turnover through the decade, 39 people altogether took part. A new set of meetings is to begin next March. Dealing with such topics as Scripture, salvation, spirituality, church and ministry, grace, missions and escatology -LRB- end of time -RRB-, the team agreed `` that the ultimate authority and object of faith is the triune God'' _ Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Participants concurred that the `` primary source of our knowledge of God'' is the Bible, which is `` the inspired Word of God, authoritative for faith and practice.'' But the report notes that Baptists, while valuing past tradition in understanding the Bible, say tradition must be tested by Scripture, while <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> say interpretation of Scripture must be measured by tradition. `` The Bible has always been the center of Southern Baptist life,'' the report notes, adding that since the reforming <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of 1962-65, Catholicism `` has also become strongly biblical.'' On the central Christian task, the report says: `` We all agree that the proclamation of the offer of salvation to all peoples is the prime mission of the church.'' However, the report says Baptists `` stress the experience of salvation when, in faith, a person accepts <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as ... personal Savior,'' while Catholics stress the redemptive `` work of Christ'' through faith and church sacraments. `` We both set the highest priority on seeking a conscious relationship with God in this life and on striving for the ultimate goal of living in glory with God in heaven,'' the report says. `` We affirm that our love for God is best achieved in a close relationship with <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, coupled with a Christ-like love of neighbor.'' Noting that <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> devotion to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and the saints `` has been a source of division and misunderstanding,'' the report says: `` While Roman Catholics affirm with Baptists the sole mediatorship of Christ,'' they also honor the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> as `` inseparably linked'' with her son's `` saving work'' and invoke her support in prayers. Baptists `` honor <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> as the mother of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'' but consider the `` communion of saints as primarily a present reality among Christians,'' and do n't pray to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> or `` deceased Christians lest such infringe the sole mediatorship of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>.'' However, `` great progress has been made in mutual understanding'' on this matter, the report says, with <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> devotion to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> undergoing `` significant change'' since the Second Vatican Council, seeing her more in biblical terms. `` Both Southern Baptists and Roman Catholics agree that salvation is God's free gift of grace, unmerited by any human works or righteousness,'' the report says. The report says both Baptists and Catholics regard the church as `` the body of Christ,'' but Baptists stress the individual congregation, while Catholics see the church in broader dimensions as the entire `` People of God.'' <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and Baptist worship differs `` in tone and style,'' Catholic worship centering on liturgical prayers and Holy Communion, while Baptist worship centers on preaching, singing and prayer, the report says, adding: `` Both groups have a strong sense both of human sinfulness and of God's love even amid our sins and failings; both stress strong family life and sexual morality; both stress active engagement in church life.''

 Repesentatives of two Orthodox branches that split in the fifth century over presumed differences about the nature of Christ have agreed on a joint statement of common faith.

They divided in the fifth century when the Orientals did not participate in the <ORGANIZATION> Ecumenical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chalcedon </ORGANIZATION>, which defined two natures of Christ, divine and human. Orientals affirmed one united divine-human nature. The joint statement says, `` Those among us who speak of two natures in Christ do not thereby deny their inseparable, indivisible union; those among us who speak of one united divine-human nature in Christ do not deny the continuing dynamic presence in Christ of the divine and the human ... `` We neither separate nor divide the human nature in Christ from his divine nature, nor do we think that the former was absorbed in the latter and thus ceased to exist.''

 <LOCATION> Colstrip </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, spends $ 5,148 per pupil. The district's 6-year-old high school is flush with computers, up-to-date labs, even a greenhouse and indoor pool This eastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> district, with a tax base enriched by the presence of four power plants, offers high school pupils several foreign languages and such electives as zoology, microbiology and geology. Superior, in the western end of the state, spends about $ 3,000 per pupil. The newest school building is 28 years old. There are no science electives beyond basic biology, chemistry and physics, in labs described as `` woefully inadequate'' by former superintendent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>. Indoor swimming pools or greenhouses like in <LOCATION> Colstrip </LOCATION>? `` Those would be dreams,'' said <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>. Such contrasts between rich and poor districts, endemic to virtually every state, put school finance at the top of the education reform agenda this past year. As 43 million children prepare for a new school year, an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey found 11 states defending against lawsuits brought by parents or school districts challenging the constitutionality of school funding systems _ systems that critics have long held discriminate against those living in communities with lower property tax revenues. `` While many people talk about the importance of educational reform, children in low-wealth districts would be helped a lot just to be brought to where high-spending districts now are,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, a school finance expert at The <ORGANIZATION> RAND </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think-tank. States with active lawsuits or court orders concerning school finance are <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. A coalition of poor <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> districts says it will probably sue that state this fall. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, 22 districts sued the state in 1986. The state won a summary judgment in 1987. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, under court order since February to reform its funding system, held a special legislative session this summer, which boosted state education spending by $ 61 million but which critics say failed to solve the equity problems. <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> legislators likewise have been meeting in special session this summer to consider sweeping proposals by Gov. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> that would substitute income and other taxes for much of the school property tax. So far, nothing has been decided. The equity issue has reasserted itself in the school reform agenda this year for several reasons. Chiefly, many state funding systems are simply out-of-date, formulated in the early 1970s during the last great wave of school finance reform. `` In many states, you have a finance system dating from the early 1970s. You still have that system in 1989 when the school expectations, the demographics and the economics are all different. You can take me to any state from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, and I could tell you that same story,'' said <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> who follows such money matters for the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> of the States in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. And school reform, with its mandates requiring rich and poor districts alike to fund smaller classes, higher teacher pay and other costly measures, has pushed many small, tax-poor districts to their financial limits. `` It's clear that as the reform agenda moves on, that's anted up the cost,'' <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said. In many states, the school finance issue is pitting rural districts with poor tax bases against bigger, wealthier ones. With farm values declining and fewer children interested in pursuing agricultural careers, the quality of schools in rural districts has become a more urgent concern. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, nine school districts and 48 parents filed suit in June, claiming the state's system of providing aid to schools is unconstitutional. A school district's ability to finance eduction is `` unfairly and inequitably linked'' to its property wealth, said <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolfson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION> attorney representing the plaintiffs. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where a lawsuit brought by a group of smaller districts is pending before the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, lead attorney <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> said, `` They have no chemistry, no physics, no calculus, foreign language, pre-kindergarten, or college prep, no extra-curricular, no band, choir, football, no debate. They have 96 percent low-income students. Those students are not being given a chance in this society.'' `` We've managed to just squeak by year after year,'' said <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Parra </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizario </LOCATION> school district. `` But taxpayers in our school district will probably face another tax increase. How long can you stretch a rubber band?'' In <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, by contrast, the poor children suing the state live in metro areas. The non-profit Education Law Center, in a suit on behalf of 20 school-aged children in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Irvington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, won its first victory last summer when Administrative Law Judge <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefelt </PERSON> ruled that the 1975 state formula for funding public education has failed and is unconstitutional. In a scathing ruling, <PERSON> Lefelt </PERSON> found that poorer, urban districts are overcrowded, have fewer teachers, poor equipment, decaying buildings, and more limited course offerings than wealthy suburban districts. State education commissioner <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooperman </PERSON> has rejected those findings, as has Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> who dismissed <PERSON> Lefelt </PERSON>'s ruling as `` an interesting liberal treatise.'' The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to hear arguments Sept. 25. In <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, where the state is being sued by a group of urban schoolchildren and parents, assistant superintendent <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamas </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> said his district fights a constant budget battle. <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> spends $ 5,431 per year on each of its 19,270 students. Affluent <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, just 10 miles away, spends $ 8,299 per pupil. `` If you look at the state as a whole, you see two Connecticuts,'' one rich and one poor, <PERSON> Shamas </PERSON> said. `` If you look at what we're spending per pupil and what other -LRB- more wealthy -RRB- towns are spending, that tells the whole story.'' <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION> Schools Comptroller <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nigri </PERSON> rejects the argument that rich and poor towns offer substantially different educational opportunities. `` For the basic educational program, a child can get a great deal out of a big-city system if they're motivated,'' <PERSON> Nigri </PERSON> said. `` We may have some better enrichment programs, perhaps a little better drama program, but I like to think there's some education equality.'' While not yet the subject of a lawsuit in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, school finance has become one of that state's thorniest issues. After failing to solve the problem, the legislature has placed two competing referendums for voters to decide in November. One would raise some $ 400 million in school funds with a sales tax hike; the other would hike sales taxes by $ 468 million but offer $ 1.3 billion in property-tax relief. `` There has never been a time that I've been told by the districts and educators that we've provided enough money,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a legislator in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> where 48 school districts have filed suit claiming that state's funding formula is unfair. `` Nobody knows what really is enough money. That's a judgment call.''

NEW <LOCATION> MEXICO </LOCATION> _ Since 1986 when a state law limited school property taxes, more than 95 percent of the operational funds for public schools come from state appropriations. But with school spending still lagging, some now support increasing reliance on property taxes so long as it's equitable. <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YORK </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> voters, angered by property tax increases of as much as 60 percent, rejected school budgets in 28 districts this spring, greatest number in at least a decade. Governor's commission recommended changes in state aid formula, but <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> took no significant action <LOCATION> NORTH </LOCATION> <LOCATION> CAROLINA </LOCATION> _ Most school funding comes from state, and all counties get same amount of funding. But state sources say <ORGANIZATION> Reidsville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> is considering suing state over its funding formula. <LOCATION> NORTH </LOCATION> <LOCATION> DAKOTA </LOCATION> _ Nine school districts and 48 parents filed suit against state in June, claiming <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s system of providing aid to public schools is unconstitutional. Suit pits urban districts, which have more students but less property wealth, against rural districts, with fewer students and more property from which to draw tax revenue. <LOCATION> OHIO </LOCATION> _ Lawmakers have for years debated dozens of proposals that backers say would close the funding gap among <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> schools; none have passed. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> approved local-option income tax provision. Some 85 districts as of July 7 had taken initial steps to compute income tax rates. <LOCATION> OKLAHOMA </LOCATION> _ Legislators this summer considering Gov. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON>'s ambitious plan to replace most of the property tax with a special school tax and a system of income tax surcharges. <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> says his plan would add $ 281.5 million for <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> schools; it faced stiff opposition. <LOCATION> OREGON </LOCATION> _ Federal lawsuit filed this spring on behalf of three <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> high school seniors challenges state's school funding method. Group of school districts plans similar challenge. State pays about 30 percent of costs of local schools; local property taxes pay most of remainder. <LOCATION> PENNSYLVANIA </LOCATION> _ Voters in May trounced referendum backed by Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> designed to rework the way local governments tax residents. Plan sought to reduce residential property taxes by allowing local governments and school officials to impose new income and sales taxes. <LOCATION> RHODE </LOCATION> <LOCATION> ISLAND </LOCATION> _ Legislature voted in 1985 to limit local property tax increases to 5.5 percent a year in exchange for increased state education aid. The state, which contributed 40 percent of local education costs in 1985, now kicks in 50 percent; goal is 60 percent by 1993. <LOCATION> SOUTH </LOCATION> <LOCATION> CAROLINA </LOCATION> _ The Education Finance Act passed in 1978 includes formula to calculate tax-paying ability of each school district. Assessors must meet minimum standard for that school district, then the state provides additional funds. <LOCATION> SOUTH </LOCATION> <LOCATION> DAKOTA </LOCATION> _ The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> froze local property taxes effective July 1 at request of Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON>. Local governments have the power to exempt themselves. The freeze was imposed to give state time to study school funding methods, which depend almost solely on property and sales tax. <LOCATION> TENNESSEE </LOCATION> _ Sixty-six school districts have sued state claiming smaller districts come up short in school funding and state fails to make up the difference. No court date set. State provides about 50 percent of school funding, virtually all from sales tax. <LOCATION> TEXAS </LOCATION> _ Group of school districts has sued state claiming funding method is discriminatory. The districts won lower court ruling, which was reversed by appeals court. Case pending before <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> UTAH </LOCATION> _ State's funding system, the `` weighted pupil unit,'' is among the most equal in the nation, providing about $ 2,400 per student in state funds. But per pupil spending still ranks near bottom. <LOCATION> VERMONT </LOCATION> _ State equalization formula changed over the last three years to take property tax rates into account, and state money for local schools doubled from $ 71 million in 1985 to $ 137 million. Still, property tax rates have soared in several large districts; <LOCATION> Bennington </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> defeated school budgets. <LOCATION> VIRGINIA </LOCATION> _ Legislative commission created this year looking at ways to ease school property taxes. State budget for 1988-90 included a $ 550 million-plus boost in school aid, with state increasing its share of local school costs from 50 percent to 52 percent over the two-year period. Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> has set goal of 55 percent. <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> _ Ten-year-old court ruling required state to fully fund education. Local levies permitted only for enrichment, and now average about 17 percent of the state allocation. Voters this fall will decide a `` Children's Initiative'' to increase spending. <LOCATION> WEST </LOCATION> <LOCATION> VIRGINIA </LOCATION> _ State remains under 1982 court order declaring school finance system unconstitutional and ordering <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> to draw up a plan to correct inequities. Second ruling declared state's property tax system unconstitutional. Changes would cost $ 1.3 billion, but entire state budget is only $ 1.7 billion. <LOCATION> WISCONSIN </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in February upheld school funding formula under which state apportions about $ 1.3 billion a year among districts. <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> school officials argued unsuccessfully that children in large cities have special high-cost problems. <LOCATION> WYOMING </LOCATION> _ Superintendent of Public Instruction <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Simons </PERSON> in August urged <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to add a 1 percent sales tax to ease financial problems in state education funding to raise $ 50 million a year. <PERSON> Simons </PERSON> suggested increase to make up for <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s dwindling oil and gas money reserves that have been used to fund school programs.

 <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommars </PERSON> plays both <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>'s courtroom adversary and his love interest in <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Matlock. `` I'm frequently the prosecutor going up against defense attorney <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>, so that makes me the loser of the week,'' Sommars said. `` I'm the modern-day <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>, who was defeated every week by ` <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>.' `` <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> said we have to have a show where I win a case. ... Actually, I did win once. <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> was accused of jury tampering. I quit my job with the district attorney's office and defended him. I was wonderful and he got off.'' Sommars made a guest appearance on the show near the end of the first season in 1987. It was to be a one-time appearance. But she did a second episode that season and was put under contract as a recurring character at the opening of the second season. Battling lovers is an old dramatic custom that <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> used and that <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> honed to perfection in their movies. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> as <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> and Sommars as Julie March generally confine their confrontations to the courtroom. `` <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> writes most of our scenes together, which is why they work so well,'' she said. `` He wants our relationship to be entertaining but he also wants it to be mature and grownup. He makes it work and that's why they keep asking me back. `` We ca n't do what they do in ` <LOCATION> L.A </LOCATION>. Law.' We ca n't jump into the shower. It has to be a relationship. This is an eight o'clock show. When you have two people talking together, yet you have to show love, that's very hard to write. I do n't know if they've ever been to bed. But I think they have and that's the way I play it. I do n't know if <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>'s playing it that way. Although `` Matlock'' generally runs second to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s comedy block, it was 14th in the ratings for the 1988-89 season. It leads off <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s Tuesday night schedule and is followed by `` In the Heat of the Night'' and `` Midnight Caller.'' Sommars celebrates her 30th year in show business this year, but `` Matlock'' is only her second series. She co-starred with <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dailey </PERSON> as his daughter in `` The Governor and J.J.'' from 1969 to'72. She won a <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> as best actress in a comedy series in 1969 for the role. `` I came here right out of high school in <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, and the very first thing I did was on ` The Loretta Young Show,''' she said. `` I played her daughter. I had no wardrobe of my own, but it turned out <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and I were the exact same size. She let me wear some of her wardrobe. The hairdresser said, ` She must like you. She's never done that before.' `` I wore a pair of her earrings and on the first day she came by and told me to take good care of them because they were emeralds. Any time I was n't on camera I had my hands on my ears to protect the earrings. <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> saw me and said, ` I was only kidding. They're not really emeralds. I just wanted to impress upon you not to believe everything people tell you in this business.' I wish I'd taken her advice. <PERSON> Sommars </PERSON> said a guest spot on `` Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' led to a role in the feature film `` The Pad'' and to `` The Governor and J.J.'' One of the writers on `` U.N.C.L.E.'' was <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Hargrove </PERSON>, co-executive producer of `` Matlock.'' She's married to an attorney and has a 16-year-old daughter from a previous marriage and two stepchildren. `` A recurring role is great for me,'' she said. `` It's nice to be part of a series family but it's also nice not to have to go to work every day. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> is the hardest-working actor I've ever known. He not only knows his lines, he knows your lines, too. `` <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is like that, too. We were on an episode of ` Gunsmoke.' I was the sweet young thing and she was the mean ranch owner. I was the low man on the totem pole, so they did my close-ups last. They'd tell her she could leave but she always stayed to read her lines off-camera to me.''

<HEAD>War Forever Changed America's Role, Vision of Self</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s troops crossed into the stubble fields of western <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Sept. 1, 1939, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s Fair was beguiling visitors with its vision of `` The World of Tomorrow.'' Now, 50 years later, the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> you see around you may not bear much resemblance to some of the predictions of that exposition in <LOCATION> Flushing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meadows </LOCATION>, but it was shaped irreversibly by the world conflagration touched off in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The fair demonstrated that television pictures could be transmitted not only in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan area but to viewers all of 130 miles away. There were other glimpses of the future, some accurate and some not. But as the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> observed in an editorial, the world of tomorrow still had `` a great deal of unfinished business in it.'' In <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, the young poet <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> observed a robbery in his neighborhood, `` an unheard of thing, an augury of things to come after the war.'' The war. To Americans of <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>'s generation, the words would mean only one thing: World War II. When it started, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was a nation of 132 million people, struggling out of the Great Depression. It had an Army of 189,839 men, including the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, and a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> of 125,202. The federal government employed a civilian work force of 905,000. Except for the wealthy and a handful of expatriate artists, few Americans went abroad. Republican <PERSON> Alf </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON>, warning in that last pre-war summer against being drawn into `` the balance-of-power game'' in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said, `` Never has there been a more urgent call to be Americans, first, last, and all the time.'' Looking back at that time, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaumont </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M military historian on leave to teach at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, said in a recent interview, `` There was a long period of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> having a very weak willingness to be involved in world affairs except during that very tiny moment during World War I, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lunged onto the stage and then looked kind of bewildered and jumped back off again. `` We've got a completely different history behind us now,'' <PERSON> Beaumont </PERSON> said. What a history! <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bataan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> the Riveter. The Marshall Plan. The Cold War. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Radar. Computers. The atomic bomb. `` For most people my age, the war and its aftermath were the most intense experience of our lives,'' <PERSON> Telford </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> prosecutor at 12 of the 13 <ORGANIZATION> Nuremberg </ORGANIZATION> war crimes trials, told oral historian <PERSON> Studs </PERSON> <PERSON> Turkel </PERSON>. By the time the war ended, 293,986 Americans would have died in combat, nearly as many as the total enlistment in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in 1939. Today, in a nation of 247 million people, more than 2.1 million Americans wear their country's uniform and 3.1 million work for the federal government as civilians. The latest <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures for a 12-month period show 14.4 million Americans traveling abroad, not including trips to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The nation enjoys unprecedented affluence, but its cities are beset by crime and drugs. When war came, `` millions of people were itching to get to work,'' said <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>. `` The war gave them a chance to get to work.'' Many of the millions were women. When peace returned, many kept on working. The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> says 11,178,000 women 14 and older were employed in 1939. In 1989, counting only those 16 and older, the figure is 52,997,000. In world affairs, an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that had been reluctant to get involved emerged from the war to find itself a superpower confronted by another. In <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, it would be involved as never before. Television signals bouncing off satellites in space bring live pictures of turmoil abroad into American living rooms. The radar screens perfected during World War II to track enemy ships and planes now catch speeders on the interstate highway system, itself a legacy of <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, World War II general turned president. In the popular Futurama exhibit at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s Fair, architect <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bel </PERSON> <PERSON> Geddes </PERSON> predicted an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> fueled chiefly by liquid air. Atomic energy would have only a minor role. The bombs dropped on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> changed all that. As the war began, President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s isolationist ambassador to <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, harbored hopes that his eldest son would enter politics and perhaps become president. But in the summer of 1944, Lt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was killed when his <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plane exploded over the English Channel. It would be <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the ambassador's second son, who would succeed the wartime hero <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> as president. <LOCATION> JFK </LOCATION>, whose father had opposed aid to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and said the war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was not `` our fight,'' would proclaim in his inaugural address that Americans were `` unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.'' The vision of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a world policeman would come under attack as the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> deepened, and in succeeding years public opinion polls would show disenchantment with it. Nevertheless, few believe that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will ever return to the kind of isolationism that prevailed in the 1930s. The change in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, says historian <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, is `` a huge complex phenomenon, which is almost equivalent to the waves of immigration that had gone on to settle <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' That's an academic talking. The poet <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, now 75 and writing his memoirs, puts it more succinctly. Speaking of himself and his friends in the Baltimore of 1939, he writes: `` The war was hanging over their heads like a cobra ready to strike.''

 `` Rain Man'' -LRB- MGM Home Video. VHS-Beta, $ 79.95. Rated R -RRB- `` Rain Man,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>'s compelling drama about an autistic savant and his hustler brother, won the Academy Award for best picture of 1988 by beating out one of the decade's most original and artistic gems, `` Who Framed <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>.'' Where the innovative and fresh `` Roger Rabbit'' was a movie best seen on the large screen with Dolby sound, `` Rain Man'' is in many respects ordinary and more comfortable on the home screen. And without the star presence of <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON>, that's exactly where the movie would have been launched _ on television Cruise is the slick younger brother who kidnaps his institutionalized sibling to fight a will. After using him at the blackjack tables in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, he begins to understand his brother, becomes protective and forges a relationship. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> gives an excellent performance as the autistic older brother who has an uncanny talent for computing numbers, storing baseball statistics and recalling isolated and esoteric facts, such as <ORGANIZATION> Qantas </ORGANIZATION> being the only airline never to have suffered a crash. At times, though, he comes on like a grown-up <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Braddock </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Graduate'' -RRB-, fumbling, troubled, raging. Similar performances by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sellers </PERSON> as the illiterate gardener in `` Being There'' and <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> as the retarded genius in `` Charly'' somehow evoked more pathos but tiptoed around the laughs <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> managed to squeeze out of the inspired script by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> -LRB- based on <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>'s story -RRB-. `` Rain Man'' is a nice little movie almost tailor-made for home video.

 `` I'm Gon na Git You Sucka'' -LRB- MGM Home Video. VHS-Beta, $ 79.95. Rated PG-13 -RRB- Filmmaker <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivory </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON> was sitting around with a couple of friends one day laughing about the absurd blaxploitation movies of the 1970s. Light bulb! Fireworks! An idea. And what a jewel of an idea it was _ the enormously funny `` I'm Gon na Git You Sucka,'' a fast-moving flick that manages to skewer just about every so-called `` black'' movie ever made `` Sucka'' opens with the death of <PERSON> Junebug </PERSON> <PERSON> Spade </PERSON>, who `` OG's'' or `` over-golds'' _ he wore so many gold chains, necklaces, bracelets and belts that his face and body were almost obscured. `` He was ready to die!'' the preacher says at his funeral. Junebug's cleancut brother, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, returns from the Army to help capture those responsible for his brother's death. Assisting <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> are an aging band of superheros, geriatric Shafts and <PERSON> Superflies </PERSON> played by <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, who composed the theme to `` Shaft.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>, the dreaded <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Wermer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Faber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in `` Animal House,'' plays the villain Mr. Big. He's the evil person behind the proliferation of gold chains. <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON> has a nice touch for satire, and keeps the pace and dialogue fast. There also are wonderful, outrageous moments: Watch for `` The Street Gang Olympics,'' in which rival gangs must best each other in stripping cars or outrunning Dobermans while carrying color TVs.

 Industry analysts say that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s plan to partially deregulate local phone rates could influence other states that are considering such steps. About 30 other states already have moved away from traditional rate-setting methods to improve efficiency and bring new services to homes and businesses. Because of the state's size and the research behind the proposal, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> plan is likely to be examined closely by states that have n't made major changes, analysts said Monday.

<HEAD>Steinhardt Partners Has 6.9 Percent of Eastern Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group headed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinhardt </PERSON> disclosed that it has a 6.9 percent stake in the junior preferred stock of strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. According to a filing Monday with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the stake in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 3.12 cumulative junior preferred stock is split among <ORGANIZATION> Steinhardt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> limited partnership, and two <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> corporations. Preferred stock has a fixed, and usually guaranteed, dividend and has priority over common stock in the event of liquidation of assets, such as after a bankruptcy. But preferred stock usually has no voting rights. Junior preferred is a lesser class of preferred stock that is subordinate in the payment of dividends. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since March 9, five days after the start of a strike against the carrier. Eastern, whose common stock is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is seeking to reorganize at two-thirds its size before the walkout. <ORGANIZATION> Steinhardt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> owns 71,737 shares, or 3.1 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s preferred; <ORGANIZATION> SP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> owns 79,520 shares, or 3.4 percent; and <ORGANIZATION> GamCan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> owns 8,504 shares, or 0.37 percent of the preferred shares outstanding, according to the filing. Under SEC rules, `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinhardt </PERSON> may be deemed to own beneficially the shares of preferred stock owned'' by all three which `` constitute approximately 6.9 percent of the shares outstanding,'' according to the filing document. <PERSON> Steinhardt </PERSON> Parners purchased 23,982 shares at $ 11 per share for a total of $ 215,600 between May 19 and August 16, the filing stated. During that same period, SP International purchased 26,270, also for $ 11 per share, or $ 234,300 total, and <ORGANIZATION> GamCan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> bought 3,109 shares at between $ 10.80 and $ 11 per share, for a total of $ 28,580. The filing, an amendment to one filed in April, did not specify the purpose of the stock purchases.

<HEAD>California Rate-Change Plan Could Be Influential Elsewhere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, often a trend-setter, could influence the way other states set local phone rates by moving ahead with its plan for partial rate decontrol, analysts say. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> plan is designed to speed up rate decisions while giving phone companies an incentive to cut costs and introduce new services. State regulators will vote on it next month. The state's size, the thoroughness of its 350-page plan and its reputation as a source of new ideas all could help make its rate-setting proposal a model for other states, say analysts. `` In a way, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was embarrassed a few years ago because other states had started moving in this direction and it had n't,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said Monday. `` But there's a benefit in being late in that they've been able to pick and choose from what the other states have done.'' <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> have almost totally deregulated local phone rates, while states such as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> have introduced some free-market features to their rate-setting mechanisms. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, at the other extreme, still has a conventional rate-of-return system. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> are exploring changes now, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. In all, about 30 states have taken at least small steps away from traditional rate-setting methods, at least in small ways. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is planning to take another look at a modified rate-setting method that has not worked as intended, said <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Noam </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. A proposal by an administrative law judge that was made last week to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> combines features of plans that have been tried elsewhere at the state and national level. The commission is expected to approve the plan, possibly with modifications, next month. The plan represents a compromise among the state regulatory staff, consumer advocates and the state's two biggest phone companies, <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> and GTE <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The plan would give the two phone companies a profit incentive to be efficient by allowing them to keep half the profits they make above a benchmark 12.75 percent rate of return on assets. Above a 16.75 percent return, all profits would go back to ratepayers. In traditional rate-setting methods, all profits above the benchmark go back to ratepayers. That has tended to discourage efficiency and encourage `` gold-plating'' _ spending excessively to increase the asset base and thus increase total allowable profits. The plan assumes that phone companies will be able to achieve 4 percent improvements in productivity each year, so that if the inflation rate were zero they would be required to cut rates by 4 percent. If inflation hit 5 percent, they would be allowed a 1 percent rate increase. That is a higher standard than the 3 percent imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comission </ORGANIZATION> on <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year when <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T was given a price-cap rate-setting mechanism. Still, it is lower than the 6 percent standard some <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> consumer advocates had sought. The 4 percent productivity standard is tough but probably achievable, officials of San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telesis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, told security analysts Monday at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> briefing. `` That is definitely a hurdle. It will definitely create challenges for management and the company,'' Executive Vice President <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> McBee </PERSON> said. `` There are a lot of people who are nervous about 4 percent,'' <PERSON> McBee </PERSON> said later in an interview. `` If <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s economy stays as strong as it's been we ought to be able to manage that as long as we manage our business well,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON>, vice president for state regulatory affairs, said in an interview. `` I do n't like it but I do n't know what the heck to do about it.'' In addition to pricing flexibility, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> would be given the right to spend more than $ 400 million to replace outdated switches that relay calls. One switch in <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was installed in 1934, <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON> said. `` This is what we consider a real win-win decision for all the major parties,'' said <PERSON> Lap </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> analyst. If it really is win-win it is bound to be copied by other states, where the issue of phone rates is lose-lose politically. `` There are a lot of regulatory bodies that would like to get out of the pervasive regulation business,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, a senior analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Probe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Knolls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Japanese Drug Maker Launches Lyphomed Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ROCKS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Japanese pharmaceutical maker that owns 30 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has launched a $ 649 million takeover bid for the drug maker, which has suffered quality-control problems but gained fame for its drug used to treat AIDS-related pneumonia. <ORGANIZATION> Fujisawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has offered $ 31 per share for the stock of the suburban Rosemont-based drug company it does not own, <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday. Industry analysts said the move would give <ORGANIZATION> Fujisawa </ORGANIZATION> the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence of any Japanese drug maker. `` This gives -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Fujisawa </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- a better-trained sales force and increases their visibility'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaffe </PERSON>, a health care analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` It makes a ton of sense.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapoor </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and founder, has agreed to sell his 14 percent stake in the generic drug company to the suitor if <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION>'s board approves the deal, a company said. `` <ORGANIZATION> Fujisawa </ORGANIZATION> has been a -LRB- stock -RRB- holder for a long time,'' <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> said. `` We have had a friendly relationship with them and we have some projects under joint development.'' News of <ORGANIZATION> Fujisawa </ORGANIZATION>'s offer sent <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> stock soaring $ 7.75 a share to close at $ 30.25 Monday in heavy over-the-counter trading. <ORGANIZATION> Fujisawa </ORGANIZATION> has owned 30 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> _ about 9 million of the company's 29.9 million outstanding shares _ since October 1986, Ms. <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> said. But an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> requires board approval if <ORGANIZATION> Fujisawa </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, wants to buy more than 30.1 percent of the stock before Jan. 11, 1991. The offer was presented to <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> over the weekend, Ms. <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> said. She said <ORGANIZATION> Lyphomed </ORGANIZATION> was consulting with financial advisers and considering the proposal. The company rose to national prominence for its sales of pentamidine, a drug used to treat AIDS-related pneumonia. Company sales soared from $ 4 million in 1981 to $ 172 million in 1987.

<HEAD>Industry Pushed To Pollute Less By Using Less Toxic Material</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM KRATTENMAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRIDGEPORT, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Though the <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant here sports a new device to `` scrub'' pollutants from its emissions, company officials say that's not enough to reach their goal of a 90 percent reduction in air discharges. <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION>, like a growing number of companies, says it now must concentrate on reducing pollutants before they come out of its plants by using and producing less toxic materials in the first place. `` This is the wave of the future, the whole notion of preventing pollution rather than continually seeing ourselves in the position of having to clean it up,'' said <PERSON> Margie </PERSON> <PERSON> Alt </PERSON>, toxics program director for the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> passed laws last month requiring industries to work to reduce the amount of toxic chemicals they use. Similar bills are being pushed in the legislatures of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The challenge, says <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> toxics campaign director <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapaport </PERSON>, `` is not disposal, but how not to generate waste in the first place.'' Noting that waste reduction makes good economic sense in a time of soaring disposal costs, companies like <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> say they're already doing the best they can to use and make less hazardous materials <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> has declared a goal of reducing air emissions by 90 percent by 1992 and solid waste by 70 percent by 1995. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> quickly followed suit, announcing its own ambitious waste reduction goals. It is the idea of mandatory, government-ordered steps that irks the petrochemical plants that line the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Chemists and plant managers are wary of legislators forcing them to tinker with the delicate reactions and processes that produce everything from pharmaceuticals to vinyl floor coverings. The Monsanto <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> plant makes `` plasticizers,'' basic building blocks for a host of products. They are made from benzyl chloride, the fruit of a chemical reaction between toluene and chlorine, hazardous substances that are mixed in a vacuum chamber in precise amounts. Besides the desired product, the process yields an unwanted toxic residue. `` Believe me, we've been working very hard to reduce that,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoegel </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> environmental specialist. `` We really do n't want to make it. ... But it's very hard not to.'' So far, <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> chemists have n't figured out a way. Yet under a bill pending in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, the state would not accept no for an answer anymore. The proposal would force the state's industries to reduce their use of hazardous materials and production of hazardous waste by 50 percent over five years. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, is considering a bill to require industries to develop source-reduction plans. To help, legislators propose establishment of a hazardous waste reduction institute in the state's university system. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> bill passed with one-sided votes after a rare bit of cooperation between the environmental community and a business coalition. `` There are a lot of companies that want to get ahead of environmental issues and not just react to them,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>, a lawyer and former state legislator who represented the business coalition. But at the <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> plant here _ which produces less than one unit of waste for every 100 units of product _ reducing toxic byproducts by half in a few years could prove impossible, <PERSON> Hoegel </PERSON> says. `` It's very hard to dictate a fixed number for reduction because it's very much dependent on the chemical process itself,'' he said. `` If you're already very efficient, to get that extra little bit out may be absolutely infeasible.'' In the case of pharmaceutical makers, all-important <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> approval hinges on a product's precise chemistry. Altering the process to make less waste may harmfully alter the product, said <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozarth </PERSON>, a lobbyist for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s powerful chemical industry But environmental leaders in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> say it is n't good enough to trust industry's pace or good intentions. `` It's great that some companies out there are pursuing -LRB- toxics reduction -RRB- aggressively, but without legislation there's no way you're going to make this happen in a comprehensive manner,'' said <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Bormann </PERSON>, environmental advocate for <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PIRG </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bormann </PERSON> says it's hardly a coincidence that shellfish from the industry-heavy lower <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> are unfit for human consumption. Decades of industrial discharges have left sediments laden with chemicals and altered the mix of plants and animals in the river. `` While <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> may be setting a goal, there are a lot of companies that are n't,'' he said. `` I think the fact <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> has the worst water quality in the country speaks for itself.''

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar dipped against the Japanese yen today for the second consecutive day while share prices fell marginally on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar closed at 142.78 yen, down 0.57 yen from Monday's close of 143.35 yen After opening at 142.78 yen, it ranged between 142.70 and 142.87 yen. The dollar had fallen 0.17 yen on Monday. Currency dealers said today's trading was light and stayed in a narrow range as many market players still were on vacation. `` Because of the lack of market-affecting incentives, players find it difficult to take positions,'' said a dealer at the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Philly and Amex Exchanges Restrict Trading in `Stock Baskets'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and American exchanges have limited trading on their new `` stock basket'' products while denouncing a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> federal court ruling that has thrown the products' legitimacy into question. `` The real loser in this controversy is the American investor,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Leibler </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The exchanges began offering stock baskets to investors three months ago. <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON> said the Friday decision by the 7th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> was `` a major step backward in the regulation and development of innovative new products.'' Stock baskets are financial innovations priced to reflect changes in broad market indexes such as the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock index. Investors receive quarterly cash payments equal to a proportionate share of any regular cash dividend declared on the stocks in the index. The exchanges said trading in stock baskets would be largely restricted to liquidation, meaning holders would be able to sell them for cash. Market makers at the exchanges are obligated to buy them if no other buyers emerge, ensuring an orderly market and preventing panic selling. The uncertainty over stock baskets was raised Friday by the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> court, which ruled that such products resemble commodity futures, such as those for pork bellies and grain, and should be monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, not the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and American exchanges began trading May 12 on stock baskets after receiving approval from the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> exchange calls its product a Cash Index Participation and the Amex calls its product an Equity Index Participation. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> had asked the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to delay trading on the baskets, saying they were thinly disguised stock index futures that must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>. When the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> refused, the two futures exchanges appealed the decision to the <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which agreed with them. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement it had not had a chance to review the decision and thus had no comment. A <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said in a statement: `` We believed that they were futures contracts when they were initially submitted, and we are pleased to find the court agrees with our interpretation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> is planning to introduce its own basket, but <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsin </PERSON> predicted it would not be affected by the appeals court ruling. `` Our product is very different from theirs,'' she said. `` The index participation baskets only represented an index of stocks. With ours, you are actually buying the stocks themselves and there is actual ownership.'' The basket, known as the Exchange Stock Portfolio, is still awaiting <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> approval but the exchange hopes to begin offering it around the end of September, Ms. <PERSON> Gamsin </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> exchange is exploring what strategy to take as a result of the court's decision, <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON> said, but he predicted federal legislation would be needed to resolve the question. `` The real loser here is the individual investor for whom Cash Index Participants were originally designed,'' <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON> said. `` The regulation of <ORGANIZATION> CIPs </ORGANIZATION> as futures would dramatically diminish their potential distribution to individual investors and effectively nullify their potential to allow individuals to compete in financial markets dominated by institutions,'' <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest supermarket chains, has denied a television report's claim that it knowingly sold adulterated orange juice produced by a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> company. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that a series of <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> memos from 1979 to 1982 indicate the company continued to sell as 100 percent pure orange juice a product bought from <ORGANIZATION> Bodine </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> despite laboratory tests showing the juice was tainted. A federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> indicted two former owners and a top executive of the now-defunct <PERSON> Bodine </PERSON>'s July 25 on charges the company sold orange juice concentrate from 1978 to 1985 that contained waste water and illegal additives such as beet sugar. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernish </PERSON> denied that the grocer knowingly sold the adulterated juice, and said <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> repeatedly sought and received written quality assurances from <PERSON> Bodine </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Bernish </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> indictment would show that <PERSON> Bodine </PERSON>'s `` lied to its customers, including <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>, and provided explanations that satisfied us but, seen in retrospect, were part of a pattern of apparent deception that was used against us. Cincinnati-based <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> owns supermarkets, convenience stores and food-processing plants in 32 states. <PERSON> Bernish </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> sold <PERSON> Bodine </PERSON>'s orange juice from 1979 to 1985 under the grocery chain's Cost Cutter and <ORGANIZATION> Avondale </ORGANIZATION> brand names The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said consumers who drank the orange juice were not at risk because of the additives, but one person suffered a negative reaction to the sugar in a can of juice. <PERSON> Bernish </PERSON> said a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> has convened to investigate the case. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said a series of <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> memos from company employees recommended the grocer stop using <PERSON> Bodine </PERSON>'s juice because of the impurities. But <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> continued to sell it because <PERSON> Bodine </PERSON>'s charged less than market price, saving the grocer $ 2 million annually, according to the broadcast. <PERSON> Bernish </PERSON> said the company bought <PERSON> Bodine </PERSON>'s orange juice because the company charged less than other generic suppliers. He said <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to test the orange juice, but the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> reported there were no tests that could confirm the product's purity. <PERSON> Bernish </PERSON> said that after the company developed its own tests for orange juice, it discovered `` results that seemed to be a problem.'' After the tests and the 1983 discovery of excessive preservatives in some juice, <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> sought and received written guarantees of purity from <PERSON> Bodine </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Bernish </PERSON> said. The broadcast quoted a <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> lawyer it did not identify as saying <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> ignored the warnings from its own laboratories and the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> that said <PERSON> Bodine </PERSON>'s orange juice was n't pure Instead, <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> cited independent tests that said the juice was pure, according to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bernish </PERSON> declined to comment on the unidentified lawyer's comments.

<TEXT>
 Bingo, once a quaint game played in church basements and fraternal clubs, has become such a big business in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> that one city has started cracking down on bingo parlors. Bingo is the fastest growing of a variety of games of chance that the state has allowed charitable organizations to run in the past decade. But there is some concern that gaming has encouraged problems ranging from cheating and theft to excessive gambling. The bingo action attracts players like <PERSON> Merrlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Meland </PERSON>, a 58-year-old widow from <LOCATION> Moorhead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, just across the state line from <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>. She comes to Fargo three or four times a week for the prospect of big money, prizes and companionship. `` I think a lot of it is just to get away from the house,'' she said during a recent session. `` I ca n't stand being around that place. I have to get out where there's people.'' <PERSON> Meland </PERSON> finds plenty of company at <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Top </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Prairie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>, which operate the largest of <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON>'s five bustling bingo parlors. Prairie Public, the network for the state's public radio and television stations, has had as many as 490 people playing in its modern facility, which sports electronic scoreboards and video monitors. Prairie Public uses the funds from its gambling operations to run its broadcasting operations. Bingo, raffles and pull tabs _ a paper simulation of a slot machine _ were the first games introduced 12 years ago after <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> allowed gambling for charitable purposes. Since then, sports pools, parimutuel horse racing, blackjack, poker and video poker have been legalized. Ironically, voters have rejected a proposed lottery. In June, 327 organizations held gambling licenses at 576 sites across the state. State regulations list more than 100 ways charitable gambling proceeds may be used, including broad categories of educational, religious and fraternal activities. Eligible uses also include a category called `` other.'' Among the organizations supported by bingo or other gambling revenues are <ORGANIZATION> Bishop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION>, a Roman Catholic school; the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dance </LOCATION> and Performing Company in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>; and the <ORGANIZATION> Souris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Overall, gamblers wagered a record $ 205 million last year, with $ 18 million going to charitable groups. The state also gets a cut, with taxes ranging up to 15 percent of revenues and sales tax charged on bingo cards and some other gaming items. The revenue is welcome in a state with a troubled farm economy. But there are also worries that gambling has brought other problems to the state. Recently, the <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted to limit the number of bingo parlors. `` Bingo, in fact, is large gambling, and gambling is not like any other business,'' Councilwoman <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. Social problems are evident in the number of groups like Gamblers Anonymous, said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON>, the state's attorney general. `` Ten years ago, you could n't open up a newspaper in the state and find such a group,'' he said. `` But now there is n't a major city in the state that does n't have one.'' Cheating and theft also have been a problem, although how much goes on is hard to determine, <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON> said. Still, bingo is still accepted in most places outside of Grand Forks. Charities operating the games do n't express any qualms that they may be encouraging excessive gambling. <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON> said he expects the bingo business _ which grew 28 percent in 1988 to a total of $ 41.1 million _ to keep growing. `` It's the lure of the big jackpot that draws people in,'' he said. Prairie Public, the biggest bingo operator with revenues of nearly $ 8.5 million last year, offers nightly prizes that include a car and a $ 20,000 payout to anyone who blacks out a card in 50 numbers or fewer. Players can call 24-hour bingo hotlines that give a rundown of the day's biggest prize offerings. <PERSON> Meland </PERSON>'s winnings have included a $ 1,300 prize and a trip to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. `` It's fun to win, but I'm not like some people who are hooked on it,'' she said. Bingo is nearly a 24-hour activity at <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Top </ORGANIZATION>, run by the <ORGANIZATION> Plains </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moorhead </LOCATION>. Six days a week it offers a morning brunch bingo, two afternoon matinees, evening and moonlight sessions and, on weekends, `` red-eye'' bingo that runs until 4 a.m., said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Haaland </PERSON>, the museum's gambling manager. `` I find a parking lot of a bingo facility rather interesting,'' <PERSON> Haaland </PERSON> said. `` You see everything from Fords to Saabs in most lots. We have people from all socioeconomic groups playing.'' The large number of halls in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> is a good thing, <PERSON> Haaland </PERSON> said. `` It's absolutely great for the bingo player,'' she said. `` And I believe the competition has been good for the organizations, too. It keeps them sharp and makes us all run a good, honest game.''

<HEAD>Dealer Profits Continue Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A hot, five-year car and truck selling pace has not stemmed the decline in profits for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dealerships, and 10 percent of them may be out of business next year, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says. <ORGANIZATION> NADA </ORGANIZATION> said Monday in a report received in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> profits have dropped from 2.4 percent of total dealership sales in 1984 to 1.7 percent last year. The report forecast a continuing trend. `` The steady decline in dealership profits concerns all dealers, especially in light of the record profits the manufacturers have had in recent years,'' <ORGANIZATION> NADA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonkin </PERSON> said. However, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> last month reported their second-quarter earnings were down 3.4 percent and 15.4 percent, respectively, compared with the second quarter of 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> profits were 6.6 percent higher than the quarter last year. The <ORGANIZATION> NADA </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 20,000 businesses holding more than 41,000 separate car and truck franchises, forecast a decline in the number of dealerships in the next two years. The study said some large, highly leveraged dealerships in metropolitan areas have gone out of business, and `` <ORGANIZATION> NADA </ORGANIZATION> expects more such failures to occur in the near term.'' The declining profitability of dealerships comes amid forecasts of a weaker car and truck selling market ahead. Each of the Big Three automakers has estimated vehicle sales for this year to be around 1 million units fewer than last year's 15.8 million, the second-best year in history. The <ORGANIZATION> NADA </ORGANIZATION> originally forecast sales of 15 million cars and trucks for 1989, but has reduced that to 14.5 million. The report said dealership parts departments showed an increase in profits, but other aspects of the business, including new vehicle sales and service, showed falling profits.

 Stock prices weakened in early trading today after dropping in the previous session by the biggest amount in nearly two months. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 6.26 to 2,640.74 in the first half-hour of trading. Losers outnumbered gainers more than 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 288 up, 646 down and 548 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 21.72 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Matching the decline in stock prices was weakness in the bond market, where the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond was off 3-16 point, or nearly $ 2 per $ 1,000 in face value. New factory orders for durable goods fell a seasonally adjusted 1.9 percent in July, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Bond prices briefly rose in reaction to the report, since a weak economy holds down inflation, the enemy of fixed-income securities. But traders began to focus on an upward revision in June durable goods orders, to 1.4 percent from 0.4 percent, and bond prices fell.

On Monday the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 40.97 points to 2,647.00, for its biggest one-day loss since it dropped 46.47 points on June 29.

 <ORGANIZATION> HAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stock declined further in early trading today on the news that investors including former baseball commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> would buy control of the parent company of troubled <ORGANIZATION> Hawaiian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> for far less than the market price. HAL's board of directors unanimously accepted a tender offer of $ 22 a share from the group headed by <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Talbot </PERSON>, a former airline executive from <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Investors include <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> John </PERSON> Last spring, <PERSON> Talbot </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> headed a group that unsuccessfully bid $ 464 million for strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. HAL stock was down 87 -LCB- cents at $ 24.37 -LCB- a share in early <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading today. The stock, which has been boosted in recent months by takeover rumors, fell $ 6.37 -LCB- a share on Monday in heavy trading. A source close to the deal, who asked not to be identified, said <PERSON> Talbot </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> were equal partners in the buyout and that <PERSON> Talbot </PERSON> would likely become chief executive officer and <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> co-chairman of the company. The group plans to buy at least 51 percent of <ORGANIZATION> HAL </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. At $ 22 a share, it could purchase a majority of the company's 1.95 million outstanding shares of common stock for about $ 21.9 million. <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> stockbroker <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Havre </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> J.B. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Havre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said the offer was reasonable and estimated the stock's true value at $ 15 to $ 20 a share. `` The bottom line is the employees are going to win on this because they're getting new management which will reduce the instability caused by financial losses over the past few years,'' said <PERSON> Havre </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Magoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> HAL </ORGANIZATION>, owns about 57 percent of the company. An airline spokesman said Monday that <PERSON> Magoon </PERSON> would sell enough of his shares to ensure the deal, but he was expected to stay on as chairman or co-chairman. HAL lost $ 13 million in the first half of this year and has lost a total of $ 30.6 million over the past 2 -LCB- years. Last year, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> paid almost $ 20 million for a 20 percent stake in the company. In a critical article in June, Forbes magazine blamed <PERSON> Magoon </PERSON> for the airlines' poor performance during an economic boom, saying he `` has managed to run the state's leading carrier almost into the ground.'' Hawaiian consistently has ranked among the industry's leaders in consumer complaints compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. Last week, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> witnessed such discontent when his Los Angeles-bound Hawaiian flight departed four hours late, sources said. <PERSON> Talbot </PERSON> acknowledged the airline's problems but said his group would solve them by infusing the company with capital to buy better planes and equipment. The investors, who were attracted by the airline's routes in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, also said they would boost Hawaiian's image by improving and expanding service and sticking to schedules, he said. `` Performance is the key and making sure we operate on timely schedules will be a top priority,'' he said. `` These changes wo n't happen overnight, but they will happen. The 60-year-old airline is the state's largest inter-island carrier. It also serves <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tahiti </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> points. Its 31 planes carried 5.5 million passengers last year. After graduating from <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1959, <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> worked here for <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> as an operations manager and vice president through 1962. He has earned a reputation in professional baseball and as head of the Olympics for turning problem enterprises into moneymakers. The tender offer must clear several hurdles, including the airlines' unions, several government agencies and the company's shareholders, <ORGANIZATION> HAL </ORGANIZATION> said

 <ORGANIZATION> Anchor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Container </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said today its board of directors rejected as inadequate a $ 280 million takeover bid from <ORGANIZATION> Vitro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>. Anchor also said it was exploring alternatives to the unsolicited $ 20-per-share offer from the Mexican manufacturer. Anchor, the country's second-largest glass maker behind <ORGANIZATION> Corning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>, said the board's unanimous decision to reject the Vitro offer was based in part on an opinion from its financial adviser, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc The board also adopted a `` poison pill'' shareholder rights plan that would make a hostile takeover of the company prohibitively expensive. The plan provides for Anchor stockholders to buy additional shares at a steep discount, driving up the cost of a buyout. Anchor Chairman <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Naimoli </PERSON>, in a letter to shareholders, said the plan was intended to protect the interests of stockholders in light of the Vitro offer. It was not intended to prevent an acquisition of the company that would be in shareholders' best interests, he said. Vitro has called Anchor a struggling company that can not control its future and claimed Anchor's plants needed upgrading. Anchor denied Vitro's claims.

 Grain and soybean futures were mostly lower in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, largely in response to badly needed rain in some critical growing areas of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The nation's oldest operating distillery has filed for bankruptcy court protection, apparently thwarting an attempt by a bank seeking to recover 585,000 gallons of whiskey it owns. <PERSON> Michter </PERSON>'s Distillery, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Aquarii </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and its subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mash </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distilleries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, filed on Friday for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. That section of the law frees the company from creditors' lawsuits until it can develop a plan to put its finances in order The action came three days before before the company was scheduled to appear Monday in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Common Pleas Court for a hearing on a dispute with <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> over more than 6,000 barrels of whiskey. The bank, which loaned $ 4.8 million to the distillery's former owner, T.D. <PERSON> Veru </PERSON>, seized the whiskey and other assets when that company declared bankruptcy. In 1987, the bank sold the distillery to <LOCATION> Aquarii </LOCATION> but retained ownership of the rye, corn, bourbon and sour-mash whiskey, valued at $ 842,000. A dispute over insurance for the whiskey caused the company to ban the bank from the distillery. The bank later agreed to insure the whiskey and pay nearly $ 62,000 in back taxes, but the distillery would not allow the bank to remove or sample the liquor until the tax was paid. The bank was trying to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> to reduce the tax. Under a court order in June, the bank was allowed to sample the whiskey, which remains stored at the distillery. <PERSON> Michter </PERSON>'s was established in 1753 and continues to operate.

<TEXT>
 A group of 46 Japanese set sail Tuesday to visit the graves of their ancestors on a Soviet-held island off northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an official said. It was the first grave visit in 19 years by Japanese to <LOCATION> Kunashiri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s `` northern territories,'' said <PERSON> Hirotoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawata </PERSON>, an official in the city of <LOCATION> Nemuro </LOCATION>. The visits were suspended in 1970 partly because of a Soviet requirement that Japanese obtain Soviet visas before traveling there, <PERSON> Kawata </PERSON> said. The issue of the Kuril islands has been a major stumbling block in relations between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> claiming sovereignty over them and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> saying a dispute does not exist. The problem has prevented the countries from concluding a peace treaty formally terminating their hostilities in World War II. The visit to <LOCATION> Kunashiri </LOCATION> came after then Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> and Soviet officials agreed in May that Japanese be allowed to go to the Soviet-held island without visas or passports, <PERSON> Kawata </PERSON> said. About 17,000 Japanese lived on the northern islands, including 7,300 on <LOCATION> Kunashiri </LOCATION>, before they were forced to leave when Soviet forces took over in 1945. The group will land at <LOCATION> Yuzhnokurilsk </LOCATION>, a port on <LOCATION> Kunashiri </LOCATION>, to hold a memorial service for their ancestors, and return home Wednesday, <PERSON> Kawata </PERSON> said. Another group of Japanese will make a four-day grave visit to the islands of Shiotan, <PERSON> Taraku </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shibotru </PERSON>, all small islands near <LOCATION> Kunashiri </LOCATION>, beginning Thursday, <PERSON> Kawata </PERSON> said.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar declined in late European trading Tuesday, pressured by a few large sell orders in a thin market and the West German mark's strength against the Japanese yen. Gold prices rose. Currency dealers said news that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> durable goods fell 1.9 percent in July, a larger-than-expected rate, and big sell orders depressed the dollar. The dollar also was hurt by the mark's rise against the yen, they said. The dollar was quoted at 1.9410 West German marks, down from 1.9520 marks late Monday. `` The 1.95-mark level was a big chart point,'' said one dealer. `` When the dollar broke through that level it triggered a lot of stop-loss orders which pushed it lower.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.57 yen to 142.78 yen. It closed lower in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at 142.52 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.5840 to buy one pound late Tuesday, a gain for the British currency from late Monday's rate of $ 1.5745.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> began filing lawsuits today in nearly a dozen states against demolition companies that allegedly failed to take proper precautions while working on asbestos-ridden buildings. Civil lawsuits were filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in eight cities and additional court papers were expected to be filed later in the day naming a total of 34 defendants in connection with violations of asbestos removal requirements, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Today's coast-to-coast effort to punish violators is a message to those who ignore the law,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> deputy administrator. `` Asbestos is a known cause of cancer in humans, and it can be a killer.'' <PERSON> Habicht </PERSON> said the agency intends to enforce requirements for safety measures when dealing with asbestos removal by seeking civil penalties from companies that do not comply with the safeguards. Fines could range up to $ 25,000 for each violation. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to name all the defendants until the court papers were filed. The eight lawsuits filed today involved work on school buildings in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state as well as various buildings from warehouses to restaurants in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. Papers also were being prepared for civil action involving work on at least 80 school buildings in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, officials said. Federal law requires certain precautions when removing asbestos from buildings so that its microscopic fibers are not spread through the air. Violators can be subject to up to $ 25,000 fine per violation and face criminal prosecution in some cases. The inhalation of asbestos fibers is known to cause lung cancer, asbestosis, a scarring of the lung, and mesothelioma, a cancer of the chest and abdomen. Asbestos was used in past years in insulation and other building materials. Improper removal practices pose health risks to construction workers and people who return to the building or to other nearby buildings since asbestos particles often linger in the air for a long time, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that up to half of all asbestos-involved renovations may be done without the precautions required by the federal Clean Air Act. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said none of the new actions involves criminal charges, but that civil penalties in some of the cases could be over $ 250,000. Agency sources, who asked not to be identified by name, said papers were also to be filed later in the day as a result of violations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The projects cited include work on at least 80 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> school buildings; public schools in <LOCATION> Woodinville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>; a high school in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; a junior high school in <LOCATION> Holyrood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>; and colleges in <LOCATION> Pittsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Berea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. In one case, a contractor was being cited for transporting wine tanks by helicopter from a winery in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, without removing asbestos insulation pads, causing asbestos particles to scatter over miles of countryside. Other cases involved a <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> casino; an apartment building in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; a boiler room at the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Quantico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; the <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, and two <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> restaurants. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> crackdown comes only weeks after a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study indicated that in many cases the improper removal of asbestos from buildings may pose more of a health risk than leaving the material in the building. The study by <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s Energy and <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> suggested that if precautions are not taken the `` removal of asbestos may actually increase exposure to building occupants'' as well as workers involved in the renovation. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that more than 730,000 commercial buildings in the country still contain some asbestos material. Last year it received about 50,000 notifications of renovation projects involving asbestos, and that number is expected to increase by about 30 percent this year, according to agency officials. By law, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> must be notified when renovation or demolitions involve buildings containing asbestos.

 Share prices ended lower, and sharply below session highs, Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as a weak opening on Wall Street undermined the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market. The market opened lower following Wall Street's sharp decline Monday, rallied around midday as several key stocks attracted investor interest, and then slid back into negative territory as Wall Street opened weaker. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended down 3.9 points, or 0.2 percent, at 2,370.8, down from a session high of 2,385.2. The index opened at its low of 2,361.5, a loss of 13.2 points. Dealers said, however, that the retreat occurred in thin trading, and did n't reflect significant profit-taking. Volume totaled 391.6 million shares, up from 349.7 million traded on Monday. `` The market is still very short of stock,'' one dealer said. `` Although private clients are sticking to the sidelines, most institutions are still on the lookout for a good, reasonably priced line of stock.'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index ended down 2.7 points at 1,966.3. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index fell 2.93 points to 1,330.64.

<TEXT>
 A late flurry of technically inspired buying pushed most grain and soybean futures prices to a higher close Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the action was in the soybean complex following the expiration at noon of the contracts for August delivery of soybeans, soybean meal and soybean oil, analysts said. Some traders sold the August contracts and bought those for September, October or November delivery. The result was a sharp drop in the August price and strong rallies in most of the later-delivery contracts. Reports of badly needed rain in critical crop-growing areas had sparked selling of soybean and corn futures at the opening of the session but those markets closed with substantial gains. Buying of soybean futures accelerated when the November contract's price surpassed the Monday session's high of $ 5.92 a bushel. August soybeans went off the board at $ 6.06 a bushel, 22 cents lower than Monday's settlement prices. Wheat settled -LCB- cent lower to -RCB- cent higher with September at $ 3.90 a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 3 -RCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.37 -LCB- a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 2 \ cents higher with September at $ 1.41 a bushel; soybeans, excluding August, closed 8 -LCB- cents lower to 9 cents higher with September at $ 6.03 a bushel

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that starting Labor Day weekend it will try to sell its new fall prime-time lineup at <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> through an ambitious publicity campaign also geared toward boosting sales at the nation's No. 1 retailer. The month-long joint program, which was first disclosed last spring, is seen by industry experts as an important step by the television networks in halting the erosion of audiences to cable, independent TV outlets and video tapes. CBS and <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced a similar arrangement in May. The networks provide air time for the retailers and their products in exchange for help in publicizing TV programs to a wide range of retail customers. Both the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS promotions include contests. Network executives hope the promotions will encourage people to tune in to the shows at least once, and possibly become regular viewers. `` It really uses the strength of both,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, senior vice president for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, said of the network-retail tie-in. `` What we're trying to do is make people aware of the new shows and interested in the new shows. `` This gives us broad-based reach, which is very important.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> _ the three major networks _ claimed only 67 percent of the audience in prime time during the 1988-89 TV season, down from 70 percent in the 1987-88 season and 92 percent a decade ago. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Brightest Stars: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> and You'' promotion, which begins Sept. 3 and will continue for the next four weeks, attempts to entice viewers and advertisers to five new TV series through a combination of games, store displays, advertisements and direct mail. In the past, the networks touted their new shows mainly by running promotional spots on their own network or placing ads in newspaper TV listings. Last year <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> ventured into other marketing techniques by including its fall schedule on some cereal boxes. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> says it will begin traditional promos on Wednesday, and take those a step further by running `` prommercials'' on closed-circuit sets at Sear's 850 retail stores next month. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> will also insert an eight-page brochure about <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s shows in its catalog and in bills to its 20 million charge-card customers. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said it hopes to increase sales and store traffic, now at around 2.2 million people daily, as a result of the contest and joint publicity effort. Included in the promotion is a weekly sweepstakes beginning Sept. 3 that offers winners, among other things, a small part on one of the new prime-time NBC series: `` Baywatch,'' `` Hardball,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Mancuso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` Sister Kate'' and `` Nutt House.'' Contestants must answer questions about <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> programs in a questionnaire that will appear in <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> advertising supplements. Those playing the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> game will have to watch specific shows to see if they have won, while those participating in <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s contest will be able to find the answers in the advertising supplement itself. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, will also provide round-trip tickets to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> grand prize winners, in addition to 300 pairs of tickets to other sweepstakes winners. An in-flight video will outline the fall schedules of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and the airline. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> division will provide two dozen 1990 Reattas for the contest. Both <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> will get mentioned in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> ads.

 The dollar fell sharply Tuesday against most key currencies in thin, nervous trading, pressured by concern that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank could be raising interest rates soon. Gold prices also slipped after gaining overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery closed 50 cents lower at $ 367.90 a troy ounce. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid for gold at $ 366.25 an ounce, down 10 cents from Monday. Currency dealers said speculation that the West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> plans to boost interest rates at a regular meeting later this week sent the dollar tumbling against the mark. In both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European trading, the dollar slipped below the psychologically important 1.95-mark level. `` The 1.95-mark level was a big chart point,'' explained one dealer in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` When the dollar broke through that level it triggered a lot of stop-loss orders which pushed it lower.'' Higher interest rates tend to support a currency partly because they make securities denominated in that currency more attractive to foreigners. <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodland </PERSON>, chief corporate trader for <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the dollar also was depressed by a drop in the stock and bond markets. But he said the dollar showed little reaction to a government report showing durable good orders tumbled 1.9 percent in July to the lowest level in nine months. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.57 Japanese yen to 142.78 yen. It closed at 142.52 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and at 142.145 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, down from 143.05 yen late Monday.

 Stock prices pulled out of a skid with a late rally Tuesday, ending roughly even one day after the biggest decline in nearly two months. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished up 3.99 at 2,650.99 after having been down roughly 20 points in late-morning trading. Other indicators were mixed. Tuesday at first appeared to be a repeat of Monday's decline, when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrials fell 40.97 points. But stocks rose from their bottoms around noon, leveled off, and then erased all their losses with a spurt of program trading in the final hour. Traders said there was no major news to account for either the early decline or the late recovery.

<HEAD>Georgia Gulf Gets Stock `Enhancement' Plans From Simmons</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, through one of his holdings, has contacted the head of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, suggesting a variety of moves that could `` enhance'' the value of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> company's stock, of which <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> owns almost 10 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> stock jumped $ 6 a share following the release of the letter Tuesday, but analysts said the correspondence was vague and shed little light on the Texan's intentions. The letter, dated Monday, was signed by <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> NL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a chemical and oil service company acquired by <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> last year. It was released in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to comment on the letter, saying in a statement `` it would be given appropriate consideration in due course.'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> owns 2.3 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION>, a chemical and polymer spinoff of Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said his interest in the company was `` no longer held solely for the purpose of investment.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing set off speculation that <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> might launch a takeover bid and kept <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price rising. Two months ago, the price was $ 35 a share; it closed Tuesday at $ 58.75 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, up $ 7.25. `` We believe that the value of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION>'s common shares would be enhanced by a transaction in which shareholders receive $ 55 per share in cash,'' said the letter to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuse </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION>. `` Such a transaction might take the form of a leveraged recapitalization, merger or other transaction. In our present view, <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION>'s foreseeable cash flow could service the amount of debt required to fund such a transaction as well as fund needed capital expenditures,'' the letter read. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> was ready to participate in such a transaction, for example, by contributing its existing holdings to fund a new equity base. `` I see it as just another pressure tactic,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Wertheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schroder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` There's nothing concrete in the statement He's not saying he's going to buy the company.'' Because no offer has been made, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> does n't have to respond A possible move, however, might be for <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> to establish an employee stock ownership plan to fend off a hostile takeover attempt, he said. Analysts previously have said a takeover is unlikely without the consent of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> management because the company's managers own 25 million shares and the company has little debt. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> has built a fortune estimated at more than $ 1.6 billion by buying and selling major corporations. His holding company, Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Valhi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, had 1988 sales of $ 2.25 billion. He got <ORGANIZATION> NL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 1 billion deal, his largest, last year. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION>, created in 1985 by <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, had 1988 sales of $ 1.06 billion.

<HEAD>Sugar Futures Surge On Rumored Indian Buying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Sugar futures prices rose sharply Tuesday amid rumors that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> had made a long-expected purchase of refined white sugar on the world market to partly offset its projected shortfall of nearly 1 million metric tons. On other markets, grain and soybean futures finished mostly higher while livestock, oil and precious-metal futures were mixed. Sugar futures settled .42 cent to .60 cent higher on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with the contract for delivery in October at 13.95 cents a pound World sugar stocks are so low, due to several years of poor sugar-cane crops and steadily rising consumption, that any hint of new purchases by large-scale consumers like <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> tends to throw the market into a bullish frenzy. There was no confirmation of Tuesday's rumor, which began on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Analysts said Indian buying had been expected for months. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s government recently approved emergency funds to buy refined white sugar, known as `` whites'' in the trade, to offset an expected shortfall of nearly 1 million metric tons `` They're talking 200,000 to 300,000 tons,'' said analyst <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Badenhop </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` They may just take that tonnage in one clip, and the whites situation is so tight that it's really going to have an impact on prices.'' But another analyst, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> rumor had surfaced only to justify heavy computer-based buying by commodity funds. He conceded that supply and demand factors pointed to higher prices but contended that Tuesday's buying was triggered by the market's failure on Monday to significantly extend the sharp losses registered Friday. `` When the market lacked this followthrough, it found itself in an oversold condition and buy-stops today propelled the advance,'' <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said. A late flurry of technically-inspired buying pushed most grain and soybean futures higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the action was in the soybean complex following the expiration at noon of the contracts for August delivery of soybeans, soybean meal and soybean oil, analysts said. August soybeans went off the board at $ 6.06 a bushel, 22 cents lower than Monday's settlement prices. Wheat settled \ cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with September at $ 3.90 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 4 cents higher with September at $ 2.38 \ a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 2 \ cents higher with September at $ 1.41 a bushel; soybeans, excluding August, were 6 -LCB- cents lower to 9 cents higher with September at $ 6.03 a Most cattle futures prices rose on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in line with higher spot-market prices for fed cattle. Hog futures were mixed while pork-belly futures advanced on expectations of stronger demand for bacon. Live cattle settled unchanged to .35 cent higher with the contract for delivery in September at 74.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent lower to .15 cent higher with August at 84.20 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent lower to .25 cent higher with October at 40.65 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .02 cent to 1.08 cents higher with August at 26.82 cents a pound. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled unchanged to 12 cents higher in lackluster trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the September contract expired at $ 19.08 a barrel and the October contract climbed 5 cents to $ 18.69. Heating oil settled .03 cent to .13 cent lower with September at 51.79 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .46 cent to .76 cent higher with September at 53.58 cents a gallon. Gold finished unchanged to 50 cents lower on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange with August at $ 367.90 a troy ounce; silver was 0.3 cent to 0.8 cent lower with September at $ 5.235 a troy ounce.

<TEXT>
 Oil futures prices ended mixed Tuesday in uneventful trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The September contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, closed flat at $ 19.08 a barrel, unchanged from Monday, despite the final day of trading on the contract. Contracts for delivery later in the year posted slight gains. Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasoline for September delivery rose 0.76 cent to 53.58 cents a gallon. Other contracts had smaller advances. Domestic heating oil for September slipped 0.10 cent to 51.79 cents a gallon and later contract months also declined. Traders said that except for two brief buying spurts, one early and another shortly before the closing bell, activity was slow with products leading the way. Crude for September delivery dipped to $ 18.88 during the session, but strong selling in the gasoline market helped recover some of the losses. `` Strength in gasoline helped hold up crude,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Unger </PERSON>, energy broker with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said anticipation of a drop in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gasoline stocks helped boost prices. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> releases weekly inventory statistics on crude and refined products after the close of trading on Tuesday. Traders expect a rise in heating oil stocks and only minimal changes in crude supplies, <PERSON> Unger </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Mazda Shows Three New Models for '90, Plans Brand ID Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday introduced three new 1990-model cars, two of them subcompacts, and unveiled an advertising campaign aimed at making the Japanese automaker's name more recognizable to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> buyers. The new models include the 929 S, which basically is the same as <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>'s flagship 929 sedan but with a 190 horsepower engine, compared with the 158 horsepower engine in the standard 929. The more powerful engine will add $ 1,500 to the 929 base price of $ 23,300. The 929's base price for 1989 is $ 20,900. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> also introduced two new subcompacts, a restyled 323 Hatchback and the 323 Protege sedan. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> will keep the 323 designation in front of the Protege for a year then drop it. The 323 Hatchback's base price is $ 6,599, the same as in 1989, and the Protege's is $ 9,339. In other product news, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> said it was offering a four-wheel-drive version of its MPV minivan and would begin building 1990 models of its 626 sedan at its plant in <LOCATION> Flat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> also makes its MX-6 coupe and the Ford Probe at the plant. By the time 626 production at Flat Rock reaches full production of 54,000 cars a year, that plant will produce most of the 80,000 or so 626 cars it expects to sell in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> next year. That gives the company more room in its import quota for the Miata two-seat, convertible sports car, which has met with heavy demand. The company plans to import 40,000 of the cars a year, although it does n't plan to boost availability in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> began a new series of brand-identification advertisements earlier this month and will show off its 1990 cars and trucks in another series of ads beginning in September, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, deputy general manager and group vice president for sales of <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marketing arm `` Compared with <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> consistently trails in the areas of brand image and brand familiarity,'' <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> said. `` Our image is generally positive, yet it is not nearly as well defined as <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s or Toyota's.'' He said the campaign would focus on a new theme involving the Japanese concept of `` kansei engineering,'' or incorporating a driver's five senses into design and engineering of a car. The company's new advertising slogan will be `` It just feels right.'' Separately, a <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> executive said the company is exploring development of a second dealer network to market luxury cars as <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has done with <PERSON> Acura </PERSON>. This fall, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will deliver Lexus cars to a second dealer network and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plans the same with its Infiniti line. <PERSON> Yoshinori </PERSON> <PERSON> Taura </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said his company is studying what <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> are doing, but a target date has n't been set for deciding whether <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> would develop another dealer channel for luxury cars.

<HEAD>Request Delay of Federal Court Decision on `Stock Basket' Securities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it had asked a federal appeals court to delay an order that would halt trading in a new type of security that is based on the value of broad stock market indexes. Amex spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shabazian </PERSON> said the exchange made the request partly to give investors who have bought these securities, known as `` stock baskets,'' more time to liquidate them for cash. A ruling Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> threw into question the legitimacy of stock baskets, which have been traded on the Amex, <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> for three months. Agreeing with a complaint brought by the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> futures industry, the court ruled that the securities resemble futures contracts, not stocks. As such they should be regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and not the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which originally sanctioned them. The American and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> exchanges denounced the court's decision, saying it reflected a jurisdictional dispute between two federal regulatory agencies and inevitably would harm small investors for whom the baskets were designed Baskets are priced to reflect changes in indexes such as the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials. Investors receive quarterly cash payments equal to a proportionate share of any regular cash dividend declared on the stocks in the index. The appeals court gave holders of stock baskets until Sept. 8 to liquidate their positions. But the Amex, in its request for a delay of that deadline, said late September was a more logical deadline time, because it would permit holders to receive a regularly scheduled dividend payment Sept. 15 and give the Amex time to complete the settlement process. <PERSON> Shabazian </PERSON> said it was too early to say whether the Amex would join the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> exchange in appealing the federal court ruling. He said 229,000 baskets were traded Tuesday on the Amex, compared with 817,000 Friday, and it did n't appear that investors were rushing to dump them.

<HEAD>Anchor Board Rejects Takeover Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Anchor <ORGANIZATION> Glass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Container </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its board of directors has recommended that shareholders reject a $ 280 million buyout offer from <ORGANIZATION> Vitro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The recommendation came after the board rejected a $ 20-a-share takeover bid from the Mexican manufacturer, saying it was n't in the best interest of the shareholders. Anchor, the nation's No. 2 glass maker after Corning Glass Works, said the board's decision was based in part on an opinion from its financial advisor, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which called the Vitro offer financially inadequate Vitro said it had offered a good price. `` We believe that the price we are offering shareholders is full and fair,'' the company said in a statement. `` Market analysts have uniformly concluded that the $ 20 price is not only fair but generous.'' The Mexican company said Anchor's stock was trading at a price below $ 10 a share the week before its offer was made. In a related development, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment banking company, has bought 9.7 percent of Anchor stock, raising speculation of a possible bidding war for the glass company. According to a report filed Monday with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 26.6 million or $ 19.70 a share for Anchor common stock from Aug. 9 through Aug. 14. The report said the purchase, which started the day Vitro announced its offer, was for `` investment purposes only.'' But <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> said it will continually evaluate Anchor and reserves the right to change its plans. `` I think they've left the door more open than a typical passive investor would,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Corso </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s tender-offers office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Anchor said its board also has instructed management to work with the company's legal and financial advisors to explore and investigate a `` variety of alternative courses of action intended to maximize stockholder values.'' Vitro, which holds 10.3 percent of Anchor's stock, had called Anchor a struggling company that could not control its future and claimed that Anchor's plants needed upgrading. The Mexican company, which intended to merge Anchor and <ORGANIZATION> Latchford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, had already chosen <LOCATION> Latchford </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> to head the merged operations. Vitro said Tuesday that it saw `` no sign that Anchor's management can reverse the deteriorating situation. `` Anchor's board claims to be exploring alternatives, including the payment of a special dividend,'' <PERSON> Vitro </PERSON> said. `` But Anchor has previously stated that it can not pay any dividends because of covenants in its debt agreements.'' Anchor said the board has unanimously adopted a shareholder rights plan, which it said was similar to defensive plans adopted by many other publicly traded companies. The plan provides for preferred stock-purchase rights which will be distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of common stock held as of the close of business on Sept. 1, 1989. In a letter to Anchor shareholders, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Naimoli </PERSON>, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the plan is intended to protect the interests of shareholders in light of the Vitro offer. It is not `` intended to prevent an acquisition of the company pursuant to an offer for all outstanding common stock on terms that are in the best interests of all stockholders and it will not be used for that purpose,'' <PERSON> Naimoli </PERSON> added. Vitro said it may reconsider its proposal. `` Giving this deteriorating financial condition and the Anchor board's apparent intent to try to block our offer,'' Vitro `` reserves its right to reevaluate its offer if it is delayed in consummating the transaction,'' the company said in a statement.

<HEAD>Michter's Files For Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEBANON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's oldest operating distillery has filed for protection under federal bankruptcy law, apparently stalling an attempt by a bank seeking to recover 6,000 barrels of whiskey it owns. <PERSON> Michter </PERSON>'s Distillery's filing under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act on Friday came just days before before the company was scheduled to appear in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> for a hearing on the liquor dispute with <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. That hearing, scheduled for Monday, was stayed by the filing. Chapter 11 frees a company from creditors' lawsuits until it can develop a plan to put its finances in order. The contested whiskey was seized with other assets by the bank after <PERSON> Michter </PERSON>'s former owner, T.D. <PERSON> Veru </PERSON>, declared bankruptcy; the bank had loaned <PERSON> Veru </PERSON> $ 4.8 million. In 1987, the bank sold the distillery to its present owner _ <ORGANIZATION> Aquarii </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and a subsidiary _ but retained ownership of the 585,000 gallons of rye, corn, bourbon and sour-mash whiskey, valued at $ 842,000. The company banned the bank from the distillery after a disagreement over insurance. Under a court order in June, the bank was allowed to sample the whiskey, which remains stored at the distillery. `` We own the whiskey. I do n't think there is a whole lot of dispute about that. But what we're going to do at this point, we're not really sure,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Nealon </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, an attorney for the bank <PERSON> Nealon </PERSON> said he planned to meet with bank officials later this week. <PERSON> Michter </PERSON>'s officials declined to comment. A distillery has been operated at the Michter's site since 1753.

 Losses by the nation's savings institutions rose to $ 3.7 billion in the April-June quarter, the worst in a year, regulators said Tuesday. They warned that the red ink wo n't end soon despite enactment of a multibillion-dollar industry bailout. The second quarter loss was up from $ 3.5 billion in the first three months of 1989 and was the worst since the record $ 4.1 billion in the same period of last year, the Office of Thrift Supervision said. For the first half of the year, losses were mounting at a rate that could make 1989 the worst year for the savings industry since the Depression, topping 1988's record of $ 13.4 billion. The law signed Aug. 9 by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is intended to end the hemorrhaging by shutting down failed thrifts or selling them to new owners. Eventually, the legislation, which will pump $ 50 billion into <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls over the next 26 months, should put the industry on an even keel, but not right away, warned <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON>, chief economist of the thrift office. `` You should not expect losses to instantly go away because of the signing,'' <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> said, adding, `` I would not be totally suprised'' to see no improvement in the industry's earnings in the quarter ending Sept. 30. As in the past, losses were concentrated in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, but for the first time <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> rivaled the oil-producing states in <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, which have been plagued for several years by bank and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L failures. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> losses totaled $ 1.3 billion, a little more than a third of the $ 3.5 billion in red ink recorded in the state during the same period a year ago. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> thrifts lost $ 950 million, the second-worst total in the nation, a sharp turnaround from profits of $ 126.7 million a year ago. They were followed by <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, which lost $ 515 million, a marked deterioration from the $ 58 million loss a year ago. <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> said thrifts nationwide suffered from rising interest rates during the second quarter, but the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> loss was heavily influenced by two large institutions which were taken over by regulators and forced to recognize losses from sour loans. <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> posted a $ 788 million loss, while <ORGANIZATION> Gibraltar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 332 million, he said. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, meanwhile, is suffering from a severe real estate downturn. Other measures of the industry's health declined as well. The number of insolvent S & amp; Ls rose from 394 at the end of the first quarter to 401 at the end of June. Only 68 percent of the nation's 2,934 thrifts earned a profit, down from 73 percent in the first quarter Profitable thrifts earned $ 1.2 billion, which was more than swamped by $ 4.9 billion in losses at the other institutions. The industry's capital _ the cushion between losses and government deposit insurance funds _ slipped from 2.89 percent of loans and other assets to 2.59 percent. <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> said the industry's loss rate should improve as the government closes institutions or finds new owners and the embedded losses are transferred to the government's books. At a separate briefing for reporters, officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the new agency created to dispose of failed S & amp; Ls, said they have already injected $ 921 million into 11 badly insolvent S & amp; Ls in an effort to cut interest rates paid on deposits and reduce losses. The agency expects to inject an additional $ 14 billion to $ 15 billion by the end of next month, which it estimates will trim the industry's losses by $ 500 million a year. `` It is a way to instantly cut down the $ 20 million a day that is being lost,'' said <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is staffing the new agency. `` The reason institutions are losing money is they are paying more for their money than they are receiving. That's bad business.'' <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> said it is clear from <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls' balance sheet that the industry will undergo a massive restructuring under the legislation passed earlier this month. A key requirement of the law is that thrifts raise more capital. Excluding the 293 most deeply insolvent S & amp; Ls, only half of the remaining institutions, representing 85 percent of the industry's assets, meet capital requirements going into effect by the end of this year, he said He said those institutions will either have to shrink their operations or find new investors to inject $ 30 billion in fresh capital. Also, one in four institutions ca n't meet the new requirement that they maintain 70 percent of their assets in housing-related loans. The old standard was 60 percent. Thrifts are already moving to meet one requirement of the law, a prohibition on junk bond ownership taking effect in five years. <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls owned $ 12.6 billion in junk bonds at the end of June, down from $ 14.4 billion three months earlier.

<HEAD>Ice Cream Maker to Campaign Against Hormone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WATERBURY, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An ice cream maker famous for its campaigns to save the rain forests and promote peace has targeted another issue: the use of hormones to increase milk production in cows. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Homemade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION> says it will use 6 million of its ice cream pints to lobby against bovine growth hormone. The pints will be labeled with a message to `` Stop <ORGANIZATION> BGH </ORGANIZATION>, Save Family Farms.'' News of the campaign prompted officials from <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a lead developer of the hormone, to fly to <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> on Tuesday to meet with company officials. `` If the intent of the program is to try to stop the product, I think it's unfair, it's unfortunate, it's misinformed and discouraging,'' Montsanto spokesman <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from the company's headquarters in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> also suggested that <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> & amp; <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s not turn its back on a technology that could potentially help <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> dairy farmers. Bovine growth hormone, which is expected to win federal approval next year, is a genetically engineered copy of a naturally occurring protein. When injected in cows, it can increase milk output by up to 15 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION>, one of four companies developing the hormone, argues that <ORGANIZATION> BGH </ORGANIZATION> is a management tool that can help dairy farmers produce more milk with the same number of cows. But many farmers, as well as some industry leaders and economists, fear that greater milk production will decrease milk prices paid to farmers and force smaller producers out of business. `` We feel it presents a clear threat to the dairy industry as we know it here in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, and to small-scale, family-based dairy farming around the country,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Ben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> & amp; <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s is one of the nation's leading producers of super-premium ice cream and, consequently, a major purchaser of milk and cream. The 6 million pints have been labeled with the anti-BGH message, as well as a telephone number, 1-802-BGH-FARM, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. Callers will hear a recorded message from company founders <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON> opposing the hormone technology. `` We do n't think the big companies that are hoping for big profits by selling <ORGANIZATION> BGH </ORGANIZATION> are taking into account the human and social costs of putting more and more small farms out of business,'' the recording will say when it begins this fall. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON> also will ask for callers' names and addresses so that they can send materials about the hormone. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said the pints will be distributed in more than 35 states in September and October. To help save rain forests, <ORGANIZATION> Ben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s is donating 40 percent of the profit from its Rainforest Crunch bars to rain forest-based organizations to protect these areas. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Ben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s launched a campaign to promote peace by donating 1 percent of the profits from sales of its Peace Pops to a lobbying effort to have 1 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military budget spent on peace promotion.

<TEXT>
 In two hearings Tuesday, a stern <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> told lawyers and speculators in the high-stakes corporate takeover business that the justices will not tolerate violations of their orders or courtroom rules. Saying that sneaking a portable telephone into the courtroom was `` reprehensible,'' the justices found <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer and arbitrageur <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metviner </PERSON> in contempt of court and fined him $ 1,000. <PERSON> Metviner </PERSON> was accused of lying to the justices about having a portable telephone in the courtroom during the <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> battle for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In a hearing immediately following, the court dismissed contempt proceedings against <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, a partner with the New York-based law firm of <LOCATION> Wachtell </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lipton </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rosen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>. The court said it was convinced she mistakenly released confidential documents to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> concerning the <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> bid for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But the court chastised <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtell </PERSON>, one of the nation's top corporate lawyers and <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' attorney, for not apologizing to the court for the `` discomfort the mistake caused the court. The newspaper reported the documents had been released by the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Metviner </PERSON>, who works for <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, ran afoul of the court in March when he prematurely left the courtroom after the justices dealt a major blow to <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>' $ 3.2 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>. At a March hearing in which <PERSON> Metviner </PERSON> was found in contempt, he said he had merely `` jumped the gun'' in his effort to reach his portable telephone hidden in bushes outside the building. He denied having the phone in the courtroom in violation of court rules. Twenty days later, however, he admitted he had the phone with him in the courtroom during the entire proceeding. Chief Justice <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> told <PERSON> Metviner </PERSON> the dignity of the court was at stake and `` violations need to be taken seriously.'' `` We need to send a message to those who act in a very unseemly way in the courtroom. We need to send a message this will not be tolerated ... a very strong message,'' <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said. In the <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> case, the court said it felt a responsibility to prevent any future mistakes. The justices suggested <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyers consult with <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> attorneys before releasing documents, or that they contact lawyers who request confidentiality on behalf of their clients.

<HEAD>Group Including Goldsmith Buying 25 Percent Of Mexicana Airlines</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A partnership that includes British investor Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> and a Mexican investor group are jointly buying 25 percent of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s state-run airline, <PERSON> Mexicana </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Aviacion </PERSON>, the government announced Tuesday. The foreign partners, which include <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ are pumping in slightly less than half of the $ 140 million total investment, with the private Mexican investors adding the rest, officials said. `` So the airline can face its nesessities in the future, it will need, as does the rest of the sector, significant investment,'' <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogozinski </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> council </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference. <PERSON> Rogozinski </PERSON> said that within the next two weeks, the government will release more specific details of the deal. He emphasized that the $ 140 million is made up of fresh capital, none of it `` swaps'' for Mexican debt owed to foreign creditors. Mexicana has been plagued by cash-flow problems related to its debt, which totaled $ 253.6 million at the end of 1988. The federal government, which now owns 51 percent of the airline, will own 40.05 percent under the new plan. Current private investors will own a maximum of 34.95 percent. Mexicana posted a profit of $ 136.3 million last year on revenues of $ 753.2 million. Total capitalization of <ORGANIZATION> Mexicana </ORGANIZATION> will be $ 550 million. The government envisions an investment of more than $ 3 billion in the airline over the next 10 years and adding 21,500 employees to the airline's current 14,000 workers, <PERSON> Rogozinski </PERSON> said. He said in the future, the government share of the airline will steadily decrease, perhaps to zero. The Mexican government, saddled with the second-highest foreign debt among developing countries, $ 107.4 billion, has liberalized rules governing foreign investment to attract additional capital. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> is one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s wealthiest investors. He currently is involved with a group that has launched a hostile takeover of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a British tobacco-retailing-insurance conglomerate. In the past, he has taken control of <ORGANIZATION> Crown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zellerbach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, among others. He also attempted to take over <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> is the second-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commerical bank, while <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> is an investment house. Mexicana _ <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s largest and oldest airline _ flew 8 million passengers on 80,000 flights last year, company data show. Of that, 70 percent were domestic flights. Of all flights between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Mexicana accounted for 40 percent of the passenger traffic, the company says. The airline, established as a private business in 1924, was nationalized in 1982. <PERSON> Mexicana </PERSON>'s sister airline, Aeronaves de <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> Aeromexico </ORGANIZATION>, was grounded by bankruptcy in April 1988, but has since reorganized under 65 percent private ownership.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar was up slightly from its opening against the Japanese yen Wednesday morning, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> rose moderately. The dollar started trading at 142.30 yen, and moved in the narrow range of 142.20 to 142.45 yen. It was changing hands at 142.42 yen at late morning, down 0.36 yen from Tuesday's close of 142.78 yen.
