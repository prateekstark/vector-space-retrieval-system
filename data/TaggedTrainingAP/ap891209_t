It continues: `` Now I'm home for Christmas `` My home is on the ground. `` Family all have left me, `` And strangers all around. `` It is n't what I fought for `` But what is there to say. `` I fought for flag and country. `` Please God, help me this day.''

<HEAD>Plaintiff in Prominent Abortion Case Reunited with Last Missing Child</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY L. CARTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman who was the anonymous plaintiff in one of two landmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions legalizing abortion said Friday she will be reunited with the last of the children taken from her 20 years ago. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, who was identified as <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> in <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>, said her 22-year-old daughter April will fly to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> on Saturday. It will be their first meeting in more than 17 years. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision in Doe vs. <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>, which struck down <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s abortion law, was issued Jan. 22, 1973, the same day the court struck down <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' abortion law in the more famous case labeled <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. Earlier this year <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> was reunited with the daughter involved in that case. Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> said she gave that child, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, up for adoption in 1970 after deciding not to go through with the abortion. Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, of suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, noted that two older children, a son <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> and a daughter April, had been taken from her a year before that. She said she lost custody of the children after a dispute with a sitter and `` because of me being young and naive.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, whose name was <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Bensing </PERSON> at the time, said she tried to regain custody of the children from the family they had been placed with and finally got the boy 12 years ago, when he was 11. She has not seen the girl, however, since 1972. Child welfare officials thought it best that the family not be reunited. `` Family and Children Services just kept telling me she was happily adopted and to let her alone,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. She said she managed to track the adoptive parents to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> and then <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, but hit a dead end eight years ago. In November, a week after Thanksgiving, April called. Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> said her daughter told her she had been trying to find her mother since being abandoned by her adoptive family and placed in a mental hospital at age 14. She said her adoptive father, who refused to have anything to do with her, was the one who finally told her to contact <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> social services, leading her to her birth mother. Now that she has her family back, Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> said, she plans to increase her involvement in the pro-life movement. Because of her connection to the court case and her present stand against abortion, she has been invited to represent the anti-abortion position on talk shows and at meetings. After she identified herself as the case's <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> in February, she said, her car was shot at, two trucks were stolen and graffiti was scrawled on another vehicle. She and her husband moved out of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to a suburb, she said, declining to identify their hometown. `` I'm going to start coming out, start speaking out and being more active now, because we've got the children back,'' she said. `` Not many people get that second chance.''

 You've seen flashing lights, glowing Santas and red-nosed <ORGANIZATION> Rudolphs </ORGANIZATION> plugged in to mark the Christmas season. <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lederman </PERSON> opted for something different this year: an electric chair.

 Federal regulators are reining in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s largest savings and loan, <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>, which lavished millions of dollars on expensive art, yachts, corporate jets and limousines <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> called the action unnecessary, saying the thrift was in its best financial condition in five years. In a legal order issued Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> told the institution to sell what's left of its $ 29 million art collection, some of which had been kept at the home of <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. It forbid <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> from increasing its executives' salaries or paying dividends to stockholders, told it to sell its limousines, jet and a $ 233,000 sailboat known as `` Bodacious.'' Within 90 days, the institution must stop paying the crew and other expenses for the yacht owned by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, `` Grand Cru.'' The thrift office said in a statement that it issued the order to `` curb serious dissipation of the institution's assets'' after determining that <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> had `` engaged in regulatory violations and unsafe or unsound practices.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, criticized the OTS action. `` The OTS is clearly trying to use <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> as a test case to impose its views on the thrift industry after it failed to get its views adopted by the accounting profession,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. `` Our financial statements ... have been reviewed by a leading accounting firm and found to be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. `` We intend to vigorously contest this unilateral and misguided OTS action.'' S & amp; L bailout legislation enacted in August `` gave us the enforcement power to move quickly, and we are taking full advantage of this authority,'' said thrift office director <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>. However, a private analyst said <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> will almost certainly fail and that the `` cease and desist'' order came too late to save taxpayers much money. `` Centrust is a gone institution. I think the order in and of itself is n't going to do anything. The damage has been done,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, a financial institutions analyst in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. At the end of June, <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> was reporting assets of $ 9.7 billion, making it the nation's 22nd largest S & amp; L and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s It was $ 43.3 million in the red, as measured by tangible capital, having slipped over the previous year from being in the black by $ 12.89 million. The S & amp; L and its 71 branch offices remain open during normal business hours, with all deposit accounts federally insured to $ 100,000. <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> has been seeking federal approval to sell 63 of its branches and deposit accounts assigned to those offices to <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the nation's second-largest <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> speculated that the thrift office's order was issued to buy time until the branch sales can go through One provision of the order forbids <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> from further sale of its uninsured debt to its retail customers. Such sales have drawn the close scrutiny of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since the spring when 22,000 customers lost an estimated $ 250 million by purchasing the debt of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member who is sponsoring legislation banning S & amp; Ls from selling debt through their branch offices, said <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION>'s debt also was `` potentially worthless. Earlier, it received permission from the thrift office to sell $ 50 million in debt in minimum denominations of $ 2,000. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said thrift office records show that shaky S & amp; Ls are more likely to issue their debt in small denominations, which attracts unsophisticated investors who can be misled into thinking they are buying insured certificates of deposit. <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION>, under orders from state regulators, has already sold much of its 22-painting collection, bought for $ 29 million, including `` Portrait of a Man as Mars'' by Flemish master <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubens </PERSON>. According to the thrift office, <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> also spent $ 329,000 on four sculptures, $ 208,000 for four oriental rugs and $ 84,000 for crystal stemware. Maintenance and hangar fees for its corporate jet exceeded $ 1 million a year. It spent $ 26,000 a year to lease a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION> limousine in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and $ 40,000 to buy a <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> limousine maintained in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Despite <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION>'s deteriorating condition, its chairman's compensation increased from $ 550,000 a year in 1988 to $ 950,000 a year currently Over the period, he also received bonuses, stock dividends and insurance benefits worth nearly $ 4 million. Additionally, the thrift paid $ 308,000 from January 1987 through July 1989 for guard services at his home and spent $ 45,000 in 1988 to put the chairman up for 35 nights at the Stanhope Hotel in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. As part of the order, <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> was required to make its books and records immediately available to federal regulators, who began examining the institution May 31 and complained that they were denied access to records. <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION>'s books `` are so incomplete'' that examiners can not determine its true financial condition, the thrift office said. <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> stock, which had been selling on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> for as much as $ 6.87 -LCB- within the past year, on Friday fell from $ 1.37 -LCB- to $ 1 at the close of trading.

<HEAD>Administration May Relax Ban on High-Tech Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, in the wake of the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit and the dramatic changes occurring in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> bloc, is reviewing whether to relax the ban on sale of high-technology exports to Communist countries. Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said in an interview Friday that he expected the administration would reach a decision by April, predicting that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> could be early beneficiaries of a more liberalized policy. The dispute involves a 40-year-old prohibition intended to keep high technology products with military applications from falling into Communist hands. The administration is under growing pressure to ease the controls as a way of boosting the economic and political reforms sweeping through <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Western allies argue that with Cold War frictions easing, it is important for the West to supply the technology needed for Communist countries to boost living standards. Controls on high-technology exports are administered by the <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multinational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controls </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION>. It consists of the 15 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations along with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said the administration hoped to reach a decision on easing controls in time to present the proposals at the next meeting of <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION>, scheduled for early April in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> are already discussing with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials how to prevent the transfer of militarily strategic items to neighboring Communist bloc countries. He said that such assurances would allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to look favorably on giving those two countries access to more sophisticated technology. `` Everybody is discussing what we should be doing about <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, whether it is politically, economically or technologically,'' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is considering `` a shortening of the list -LRB- of restricted items -RRB- to those things which are truly important and essential,'' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said in a separate interview taped for public television's American Interests program. `` The shortening will be substantial ... that would be our recommendation,'' he said. The administration has been split between hardliners such as <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, who oppose the easing for national security reasons, and others such as <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, who argue that liberalization is needed in light of the changes. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> was the third administration official in recent days to discuss the possibility of lowering export controls. Similar comments about possible changes have also been made by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> and Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> planned to eliminate the case-by-case approval required to export `` dual use'' high-technology items to other <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> members. `` Dual use'' refers to technology that has both commercial and military applications. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has repeatedly clashed with its allies, especially <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, over what it argues are violations of <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> rules regarding dual use technology. In the latest such case, the administration accused the Italian computer manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> of selling the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> computerized machine tools that the Soviets used to make jet fighter engines. In a speech last week, <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said the requirement for individual licenses will be lifted within six months. Referring to the question of easing restrictions on exports to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said the `` nature of the military threat faced by the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is changing'' and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> needed to `` signal our clear willingness to respond constructively to the democratization under way in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Traffic Safety Head Opposes On-Board Vapor Units</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government's top highway safety official says devices inside cars to capture gas vapors when a tank is being filled would pose safety risks. `` It appears to be an idea whose time has not come,'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> said Friday in his first speech since being sworn in last week as administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> said the agency will join safety groups in opposing legislation that would require the units on all new cars. A bill supported by environmental groups and the oil industry is pending in the House. <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> said his agency's first priority in dealing with auto and truck issues would continue to be highway safety, followed by better gas mileage and clean air. The former <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> major general said <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>'s technical evaluations show that some important safety concerns remain with the systems to capture gas vapor and return it to a car's engine through a special holding unit containing charcoal. <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> said there have been problems even with some of the simple systems cars have had since 1971 for returning some vapor to the gas tank, which have resulted in fires, injuries and vehicle recalls. Several areas of the country require gasoline stations to equip their hoses with units that suck vapors back into the station's tank The requirements often are part of state and city efforts to meet <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> air quality standards. <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> supports the idea of a vapor recovery system and will continue to work with the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to test proposals for effectiveness and safety. On other issues, <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> said he: _ Supported laws requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets, saying he would wage a campaign of letters and support legislation to require them _ Would base future recommendations for auto mileage standards, or Corporate Average Fuel Economy -LRB- CAFE -RRB- standards, `` on facts, not on theology. Environmentalists are pushing for tighter standards, but auto manufacturers say that would prevent them from building many larger cars and could decrease overall auto safety.

 This Christmas season is bittersweet for striking coal miners, who've been living off meager union payments for eight months but enjoying a groundswell of support from workers around the country and the world. Other unions are shipping tons of donated food, clothing and toys to the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> coal fields, where the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> are locked in a strike that began just after Easter. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> today are bringing toys, treats and clothes to the <LOCATION> Russell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fairgrounds </LOCATION>, where they'll sing Christmas carols for miners' During Thanksgiving week, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> had a 15 - to 20-pound turkey delivered to each striking miner's family `` This is going to be a terrific Christmas for the strikers' kids because of the support that we've got from other unions around the world,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a striker who supports a wife and two daughters `` This may be one of the best Christmases they've ever had. The strike has become a symbolic line in the sand for members of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> labor movement who want to stop the erosion of collective bargaining. They portray <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> as the prime example of a union-busting company. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> officials say they are offering a fair contract and are being unfairly targeted by the union's national leadership. The strike started after <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> bolted from a contract between the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bituminous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, saying health benefits offered by the owners' group were too generous. Labor solidarity with the miners was bolstered in October when <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> brought the union, which had been independent for 40 years, back into the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. Strikers say Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s interest in resolving the strike only increased after an official of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity movement visited the coal fields in November and criticized treatment of the miners in a meeting with Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> About $ 300,000 has been donated to a Christmas fund set up for the miners on Nov. 10. The money will be distributed next week to families of the 2,100 striking and laid-off miners in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. `` We've had people calling from all around the contry wanting to send money or donate food or clothing,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, a striking miner and the Christmas fund trustee. `` It seems like people are getting into the Christmas feeling that giving is better than receiving.'' `` They see the hardships we're going through,'' said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, 35. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 42, an electrician, said he would use his share of the Christmas fund to buy winter coats for his two children. But what his family really needs, he said, is for him to get back to work. `` It wo n't be the happiest Christmas,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` With all this support it's not going to be all that grim. But we still do n't know what tomorrow is going to bring. Union and company negotiators are planning to meet Monday in northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> for another round of contract talks mediated by former <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Usery </PERSON>. <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> is optimistic that the negotiations will lead to a settlement, but striking miners are skeptical. `` Nobody thinks it will be settled by Christmas,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The miners are preparing for the strike to last through winter and on Thursday opened an indoor rally site, Camp Solidarity II, near <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to demonstrate their resolve The miners, used to earning as much as $ 635 a week, have been receiving $ 225 a week in strike wages, and that pays only for necessities, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said. In many cases, wives who did not work before the strike have taken jobs. `` Things have gotten tight,'' <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said. `` You just hold off on the luxuries of life when you're on strike and not working.''

 Stormy weather forced <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> to delay the first commercial launch of its Titan 3 rocket carrying British and Japanese communications satellites. The attempt was called off Friday about two hours before the planned liftoff when a storm dumped heavy rain on the launch area. The delay will last at least until next week because a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> rocket scheduled for Sunday carries a military navigation satellite for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and has priority. Officials said the Titan could be delayed until later in December because it also has lower priority than both the Titan II missile launch scheduled next week and the flight of the Space Shuttle Columbia planned for Dec. 18. The flight was to have marked <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON>'s entry into the highly competitive commercial launch business. Liftoff had been postponed on Thursday night by a computer software problem.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials say the battleship <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> has entered the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> _ the first time such a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship has sailed the sensitive waterway in modern times. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Army Col. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said Friday that the 58,000-ton vessel entered the gulf Thursday night on a `` routine operation to demonstrate a continuing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to the region.'' The oil-rich gulf was the scene for much of the decade of hostilities between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, marked by fighting that sank or damaged more than 500 commercial ships and killed 300 people. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sharply expanded its naval force in the region in 1987, using it to protect merchant ships flying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags. After the August 1988 truce between the two nations, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reduced its naval presence. One Pentagon official, commenting on condition he not be identified by name, said port calls in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> are scheduled for the warship, but that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offer to have the ship visit a port in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> was turned down. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said he could not disclose the ship's schedule nor the ports it planned to visit. He did say the battleship was not being accompanied by a battle group of support vessels. While <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> battleships have entered the <ORGANIZATION> Straits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hormuz </ORGANIZATION>, which links the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to the northern <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, none has ever sailed deep into the waterway that divides <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> peninsula, other sources said. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, who said he could not confirm the movement of the battleship, said the service `` does n't have a record that indicates a battleship has been in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in modern times.''

 While most European Communist nations surge toward democracy, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, once a socialist showcase, is sinking ever deeper into its apparently unending political crisis. Faced with ethnic and social tensions, rapidly growing inflation and labor unrest, the country is now split into what looks like an unbridgeable rift between two of its six republics _ <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. Some lawmakers, newspapers and organizations even raise the issue of civil war. In an unprecedented move, <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> on Nov. 29 severed all political and business ties with the northern region of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> after authorities there banned a rally planned by Serbs seeking to topple <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s liberal leadership. Except for a desperate warning that the country's unity is `` seriously'' threatened by the clash, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s divided leadership has done nothing to ease tensions. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has for years been a socialist showcase despite its one-party system, with a relatively free press and no travel restrictions. But its political, economic and social problems have mushroomed since the death in 1980 of President <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, whose charisma was seen as a major force in keeping <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> together and submerging regional tensions. The man in the center of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s current turmoil is <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, described in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and some other republics as `` a Stalinist, dogmatist and totalitarian leader.'' In his speech to the Serbian Parliament Tuesday, <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> denounced the Slovenian leadership for not allowing an anti-Slovenian rally by Serbs planned in the Slovenian city of <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> vowed that <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> will not re-establish ties with <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> `` until the conservative, aggressive and brutal'' Slovenian leaders step down. Commenting on <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s speech, the Croatian Vjesnik daily said Thursday that the Serbian leader's `` stubborn ultimatum'' is aimed at imposing his hard-line brand of Communist orthodoxy on the rest of the country. The newspaper described as `` grotesque'' <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s accusations against <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and appealed to the country's leadership to stop the <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> president and prevent him from `` leading the country to civil war.'' Similarly, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zagreb </ORGANIZATION> last week said, `` <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is on the verge of war with itself.'' <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> has purged thousands of opponents in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, and several independent political and human rights groups, which are growing elswhere in the country, have been banned in the southern republic. On Thursday, a prominent Serbian journalist appeared in court to answer charges of leading an unofficial gathering that described <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s recent re-election as <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s president as `` undemocratic.'' In <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, its liberal-minded leadership advocates regional autonomy and has already legalized several opposition parties that are to contest the first-ever free, multiparty elections in postwar <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, scheduled in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> for March. `` <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s move against <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> represents an attack by a totalitarian concept of -LRB- Communist -RRB- party monopoly against all who strive for democratic reforms and whose oppinions differ from those of Serbian political leaders,'' said a statement released by Slovenian <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Slovenian leaders believe <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> wants to provoke a showdown with their republic in order to turn public attention away from his economic and political failures. An announced $ 1 billion public loan, described as a centerpiece of <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s economic policies in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, has all but collapsed when government officials were able to secure only about 3 percent of the planned sum. Despite <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s promises to halt ethnic Albanian unrest in the southern <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, disturbances there have continued unabated. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s parliament is to meet next week for an urgent session to discuss the country's crisis. `` Comrades, our country is falling appart,'' said a parliamentary deputy Thursday. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> point out that the split within <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> could not have come at a worse time for the reformist government of Premier Ante <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>, which is currently negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> on obtaining crucial new loans designed to repay the country's $ 17 billion foreign debt. The diplomats say <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s `` irrational moves'' could collapse the delicate negotiations that began Thursday, thereby threatening radical market-oriented reforms <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> is trying to implement in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Quayle Tells Soviets They May Like Star Wars After All</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says the Soviets may find they like Star Wars after all. `` I have a hunch, over a longer period of time, the more the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> thinks about the SDI, there may be a change of heart, because this is defending against ballistic missiles, not just a threat from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, but a threat from other countries,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in an interview published Friday in the Soviet daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. The Strategic Defense Initiative `` makes sense for both sides,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in the interview conducted Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. SDI calls for a space-based high technology network that would shoot down incoming enemy missiles. U.S.-Soviet disagreement over the plan, long a bone of contention between the two superpowers, wrecked the 1986 summit in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>. `` As we look at this world in the future, becoming less dependent on offensive weapons for deterrence, reducing -LRB- but not eliminating -RRB- offensive strategic weapons, we'll see other countries gaining ballistic missile technology,'' the vice president said. `` Instead of having only the ability of going in and attacking after an attack, you might want the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to have a more effective defense than it has today _ against Third World threats. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has always thought in terms of defense _ strategic and conventional _ so SDI, which was a sticking point in the past, perhaps will not be in the future.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he regarded the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as `` very positive'' meeting that could lead to conclusion of an agreement on strategic nuclear arms by the next summit next summer. `` Neither side is going to do anything to jeopardize its security by rushing,'' he said. `` But we'd like to meet that timetable. By making that statement, we're making a significant step forward. `` So, we're very hopeful for improved relationship, for new opportunities for reduction of tensions. But as we are hopeful, we must also maintain our preparedness, and that we will do. `` As you see those reforms take place in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, there will continue to be improvement and perhaps you can say, then, that indeed the Cold War is over. But it depends on whether the democratic values that President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> talks about can actually be implemented.'' Regarding <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that `` the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people need to ask the question: Why are we spending $ 7 billion on <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> when we could be spending it on meat and food and assistance back home?''

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has approved plans to increase <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> support in the war against illicit drugs, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> says. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized $ 450 million for <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> anti-drug programs in fiscal 1990, with some $ 70 million used to fund specific state and territorial anti-drug plans, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Friday. The largest allotments went to border states, such as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with $ 10,936,000; <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> $ 7,991,000; <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> $ 6,037,000; and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> $ 4,912,000. The decisions on the allotments were made by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> `` in coordination with the federal law enforcement agencies,'' the statement said. While the Guard may not take part in such law enforcement activities as arrests and seizures, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the activities outlined in some of the plans include: radar surveillance; detection and monitoring of drug smuggling through air surveillance; aerial photography; assistance in searching containers; transportation of law enforcement personnel, equipment and seized substances; expanded training of law enforcement personnel; and increased loans of military equipment.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is back in the snowy capital today after spending two days on the campaign trail in a three-state swing to drum up support for Republican <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates and reverse <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> political fortunes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stumped Friday for Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, the last stop in two days of appearances that included fund-raising events for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Iowa Republicans hoped <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s appearance would give <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> an early boost in his underdog bid to unseat first-term Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> canceled plans to spend the weekend at the Camp David presidential retreat in the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> countryside when a snowstorm swept the region Friday. He opted to stay at the White House instead. The president arrived in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> on a day when the <ORGANIZATION> Des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> published a poll showing his approval rating at 74 percent statewide. But Republicans acknowledged a tough road ahead for <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lightfoot </PERSON> said Friday night that the party faces `` one of the toughest most difficult years that any of us have gone through'' before the November 1990 election. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> helped raise $ 250,000 for <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> in what <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> aides said was the biggest single political fund-raiser in the state's history. `` His values reflect the greatness of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, praising <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> record. Earlier Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> at a luncheon for Rep. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman who hopes to succeed retiring Republican Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>. Republicans have pinned their hopes on <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> to retain the seat for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> and would consider it a crushing blow to lose the seat, one top <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adviser said. The night before, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> helped <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> raise $ 2.4 million in a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Astrodome dinner. <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, who accompanied <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the two-day trip, said that was the most lucrative single political event in the nation's history. However, <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, a one-time Democrat who enjoys solid backing in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is not considered to be in any danger for re-election. Speculation persists that he has presidential ambitions. Sending <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the political trail is part of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> strategy as the party tries to reverse its dismal 1989 election record that followed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s resounding victory in the 1988 presidential race. In November, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lost gubernatorial races in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and the mayor's race in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, all campaigns in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> personally campaigned. Last week, a Republican stronghold district in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, elected Democrat <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Killea </PERSON> to the State Senate. The election followed a campaign rocked by a Catholic bishop's public censure of <PERSON> Killea </PERSON> for her pro-choice position on abortion. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, acknowledging the party's losses, remarked to reporters that he had a far happier year in 1988, but insisted the party's fortunes will turn around in 1990 The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> hopes to get a solid footing early by sending the president to big-ticket fund-raising events. In <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Finch </PERSON> said the party wanted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the state early to raise money because <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> will be able to collect a sizable war chest. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy turned out for the dinner _ Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, and the state's three other <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lightfoot </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON>. Before the dinner at the <ORGANIZATION> Des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> on a call-in radio show for 15 minutes at station WHO. In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talked about the environment, holding down taxes, farm policy and international relations as he plugged <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s candidacy. `` <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is what you need and is what this administration needs _ a senator to make <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> strong, to make this nation proud, and a leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that I can work with as president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Also Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with drug policy director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> at his side, delivered an anti-drug speech to an enthusiastic auditorium of students at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the young people that if they have ideas on how to solve the drug problem they should let their schools and their government know about them.

 When <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> musicians dumped their board of directors and rechristened themselves the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Symphony </LOCATION>, in partnership with a local rock impressario, skeptics predicted disaster. It has n't happened. While things are far from rosy for the 53 musicians, they have arranged a concert season with guest conductors and soloists and launched a catchy advertising campaign that seems to be attracting larger audiences. The money is n't great _ but who joins an orchestra to get rich? And what's most important, said violinist <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Goble </PERSON>, `` We are still a very good orchestra.'' `` I think we know we still have hurdles. Sure, it's still going to be lean for the orchestra,'' said violist <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeingst </PERSON>, a member of the new musician-run orchestra's board. `` -LRB- But -RRB- we really now have got our feet under us.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> arose from the ashes of the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, which had accumulated debts of $ 2.5 million and owed $ 700,000 in unpaid rent to the city of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> symphony's troubles are far from unique _ orchestras in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, to name a few, have suffered financial worries recently. In the last two years, the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> musicians' pay was cut, the concert season scaled back. But this fall, when the board proposed a 1989-1990 season of just 11 weeks paying $ 530 a week _ down from $ 670 a week for 41 weeks the year before _ musicians decided to begin their own orchestra. `` It's unique,'' said <PERSON> Yeingst </PERSON>. `` You do n't find an orchestra where the musicians accept the responsibility not only for the music-making but the actual operation.'' <PERSON> Yeingst </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> CSO </ORGANIZATION> is paying musicians a base salary of $ 22,000 for a 26-week season. `` If the gate is larger, they'll make more; if it's smaller, they'll make less,'' he said. `` Nothing is guaranteed, just like real life.'' Rock promoter <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fey </PERSON>, who is helping to produce and bankroll the new orchestra, is more accustomed to booking acts such as the Rolling Stones. He admitted in September that he had never attended a symphony. <PERSON> Fey </PERSON> wants the orchestra off the society pages and onto entertainment pages. `` There will be some highs and some lows along the road, but at the end of the year, we'll be fine,'' <PERSON> Fey </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, an administrator for the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Symphony </LOCATION>, which is going through bankruptcy reorganization, said he sees many empty seats when he attends <ORGANIZATION> CSO </ORGANIZATION> concerts. `` Naturally we are concerned and disturbed -LRB- by the -RRB- very low level of community support for those concerts,'' he said. `` Patronage has been very low. It can not be economical for the musicians.'' <PERSON> Yeingst </PERSON> said musicians did not expect sold-out houses and improved paychecks right away. But `` we have been more than meeting expenses, and with any successful fund-raising, any kind of support, we'll be fine,'' he said. Community support, however, is a problem. <PERSON> Yeingst </PERSON> said patrons have grown resentful over the years with having to support an organization in perpetual financial crisis. `` People now are simply not willing to write a check and let it go at that. Those who are coming forward are interested to know exactly where the money is going,'' he said. `` They want to know about costs, budget.'' The symphony's new fund-raising drive is aimed at the general population, from whom it is soliciting donations of $ 18.12, after <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>'s `` 1812 Overture.'' The season opened in November with a `` Symphony Sampler'' concert in <ORGANIZATION> McNichols </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arena </ORGANIZATION> that attracted nearly 12,000 people. But a few days later, when the classical series began at <PERSON> Boettcher </PERSON> concert hall, only a few hundred showed up. `` But after finishing our fourth week things look a lot better,'' <PERSON> Yeingst </PERSON> said. `` We're getting decent houses, and they will improve. And we've had very favorable talks with the governor and the mayor'' about support for the new orchestra.

<HEAD>Federal Regulators Take Over New Jersey's Largest Thrift</HEAD>

 There was little surprise when federal regulators took over <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION>'s largest savings and loan, removing its chief executive officer and directors. <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bedminster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, had been recording increasingly large losses from real estate ventures in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Its third quarter results showed bad loans outweighing equity by about nine times. Furthermore, the savings bank said last month that it would be unable to meet new capital requirements that became effective Thursday under the thrift bailout law signed last summer. `` It's not surprising,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrystal </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who has been following the institution's faltering performance, said Friday. `` They had an extremely large amount of non-performing assets in excess of their equity.'' As of Sept. 30, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> had $ 747 million in non-performing assets _ past-due loans and loans that do n't pay interest _ and only $ 89 million in equity, compared with $ 326.2 million at the end of 1988. `` Under normal conditions, non-performing assets are no more than 25 percent of equity,'' <PERSON> McCrystal </PERSON> said. `` With $ 89 million in equity, their losses probably would have wiped out equity had the feds not stepped in.'' The thrift's dire straits prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to transfer control to the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a federal agency created in August to dispose of failed S & amp; Ls. `` City Federal was below all its capital requirements. It does n't look to us like they could recapitalize this institution without federal assistance,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Albanese </PERSON>, senior deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` And the institution is continuing to experience operations losses and loan losses,'' <PERSON> Albanese </PERSON> said. Bad commercial real estate and construction loans lie at the heart of the thrift's troubles. Only recently, City Federal sold a mortgage banking operation in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McCrystal </PERSON> said. City Federal was the lead lender in <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberte </ORGANIZATION>, a $ 750 million luxury project planned for <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McCrystal </PERSON> said. `` They got very aggressive in the real estate market, but it began to soften,'' he said. The thrift also was hurt by new rules that phase out by 1995 an accounting break known as goodwill. City Federal was among several institutions in the early and mid-1980s that bought ailing thrifts when regulators had no money to deal with savings banks and were able to persuade institutions such as City Federal to take over the thrifts in exchange for goodwill. According to <PERSON> McCrystal </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> had $ 213 million in goodwill on its books as of Sept. 30. <PERSON> Albanese </PERSON> said representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> gathered at the savings bank's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> offices Friday. They replaced Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Atherton </PERSON>, other top City Federal officers and the thrift's board of directors with a government-selected managing agent and oversight team, but retained some employees, <PERSON> Albanese </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> officials did not return repeated phone calls. According to <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>, which has taken control of 280 thrifts and disposed of more than 30 nationwide, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> had $ 9.8 billion in assets and $ 7.3 billion in 858,348 deposit accounts. <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> will help find a buyer for the institution, which maintained 105 retail branches in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> that are considered a valuable network. It also could decide to liquidate the thrift. `` For right now, it's business as usual,'' <PERSON> Albanese </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> will oversee a newly created federal mutual association, known as <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which will continue handling depositors' funds during normal business hours as a permanent solution is negotiated. <PERSON> McCrystal </PERSON> said the corporation's stock had become worthless, trading at just one-eighth Friday, but noted `` the significant loss has been over the last year or two. This is n't going to wipe out anybody.'' Four other <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> thrifts already have been taken over by federal regulators. <PERSON> McCrystal </PERSON> said the federal action was an indicator of things to come now that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has clamped down on the floundering savings industry. `` This says the government is going to follow through on the legislation passed to do something about these large, troubled thrifts.''

<TEXT>
 The battle for the presidency between a socialist labor leader and a conservative reformer has widened divisions in a country already threatened with social and economic chaos. Former Gov. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> and socialist <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Inacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> are in the Dec. 17 runoff to become <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s first directly elected president in 29 years. Neither won a majority in the 21-candiate election on Nov. 15, when about 82 million Brazilian cast their ballots. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, barred by law from seeking re-election, won a 1985 electoral college vote controlled by the military that ruled <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> from 1964-1985. Four economic plans introduced by <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s government failed to halt inflation, which is at an annual rate of 1,460 percent. Political anaylysts have expressed fear that the runoff election will be a showdown between rich and poor. They say civilian rule, reeling under an economic slump, the social impact of rapid urbanization and a $ 110 billion foreign debt, may not be ready for such a harsh test. `` This radical polarization is dangerous for <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, which now must choose between two extremes that do not represent all political options,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Industrialists say a da <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> victory would accelerate the flight of capital from the country. Labor leaders counter that if <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> leaves social reforms to free-market forces the unrest could boil over. The prospect of a socialist victory disturbs <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s right-wing military chiefs. `` We are now facing the dilemma of choosing between one man's savior and another man's devil,'' said <PERSON> Jair </PERSON> <PERSON> Meneguelli </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a labor umbrella group <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, 40, a former governor of <LOCATION> Alagoas </LOCATION> state, founded his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconstruction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> last February on a platform of moral cleanup. He vowed to root out corruption and cronyism and blamed <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> so sharply for <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s economic ills the president ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to file suit for slander. <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> has publicly refused the support of ultraright groups but they back him. <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, a 44-year-old former lathe operator, calls for a redistribution of land and wealth, increased worker control of state monopolies and a moratorium on foreign debt payments. He is the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and is backed by Marxist groups, labor unionists and the liberal wing of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> built his power base in the industrial belt around <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> and has broad support in the drought-ridden northeast. Polls taken in early December gave <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> a 10-point lead. Both candidates are trying to soften their images as they campaign to win centrist support. The main targets are the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has the largest number of legislators in both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Both candidates must form alliances. Together their parties have less than 6 percent of the seats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and the winner will have to put together a broad congressional coalition to govern. <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> has been more successful than Collor de Mello in wooing support. He has won limited endorsements from the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and from <PERSON> Leonel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brizola </PERSON> of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> who came in a close third behind da <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> in the November balloting. Rigidity in the Workers' Party could jeopardize a broader leftist front, accoarding to some analysts. `` The Workers' Party is a one-class party. It will have to open up more and become multi-class,'' wrote political scientist <PERSON> Helio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaguaribe </PERSON>.

Two radio stations that cater to Colombians have scheduled rallies today for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, convicted Thursday on two counts of manslaughter in the January deaths of <ORGANIZATION> Clement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, who remains suspended from the force with full pay pending a police department hearing, echoed feelings among <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s Hispanics that he was convicted in order to avoid further rioting by <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s blacks `` I do n't think it was fair,'' said <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, 31. You have to realize -LRB- there have been -RRB- a lot of problems in the community in the past. I was just being used as a scapegoat for this.'' <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> also said he knew the verdict would be guilty as soon as the six-member jury entered the courtroom Thursday. `` Because when the jurors came out, everyone, every single person from the jurors, they were looking down,'' he said. `` They were sad, and you can read in their eyes that nobody wanted it. And I knew, right there and then.'' Three days of racial disturbances ensued in the Liberty City and <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> neighborhoods after the shooting of <LOCATION> Lloyd </LOCATION>, 23. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24, suffered fatal injuries in the crash of the motorcycle that <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> was driving. The two were fleeing another group of police. Rioting also followed trials in the past where white officers were acquitted in the slayings of blacks. But all was quiet Friday in the black neighborhoods. Leaders of the black community praised <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s guilty verdict as a victory for justice, but many Hispanics, including the 200,000-strong Colombian community, have said the officer was shortchanged by racial politics. `` We are deeply hurt,'' <PERSON> Hernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. `` We are convinced that officer <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> was doing his duty defending the community.'' The two radio stations organizing the rally, WOCN-AM and WKAT-AM, said they would seek money for <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s expected appeal and signatures for a petition asking Dade Circuit Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> to show leniency in <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s Jan. 24 sentencing. On Friday, Jewish, <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and lay religious leaders held a joint news conference and declared a weekend of prayer for the shooting victims's families and for <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s family. `` Our prayers should be directed at preserving the unity of our community within which the opinions are as diverse as our population,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s Community Relations Board `` I think the worst thing we can do as a community is to sit back smugly and say we came through this time without fires and riots.'' <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s family issued radio appeals earlier in the day for more legal funds. `` We need money urgently,'' <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Jairo </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police officer, told listeners on WKAT. `` I could n't sleep all night worrying about it.'' `` It seems like things are better off here for a drug trafficker than for a police officer _ maybe it would have been better for us that way,'' he said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s brother, <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>, and his wife, <PERSON> Ana </PERSON>, also are <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police officers.

<HEAD>Hunter Indicted for Manslaughter in Woman's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A deer hunter who shot to death a woman last year in the woods behind her home has been indicted in a case that has aroused strong feelings, pitting hunters against non-hunters. A <LOCATION> Penobscot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury returned the indictment Friday against <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogerson </PERSON>. It was almost exactly a year after another grand jury refused to indict <PERSON> Rogerson </PERSON>, finding neither criminal negligence nor criminal recklessness in the Nov. 15, 1988 death of <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, 37. Mrs. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>, who has moved to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> with the couple's twin daughters, who were a year old at the time of the death, said he felt the grand jury had reached `` the only decision logic and reason would allow.'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said the case should be viewed the same as any other criminal proceeding, not as one that inflamed debate about hunting. <PERSON> Rogerson </PERSON>, a supermarket produce manager and an experienced hunter, has said he believed he was firing at a deer. The case has stirred strong emotions among hunters and non-hunters alike in this rural state where deer season draws thousands into the woods each autumn. In local newspaper opinion pages and elsewhere, discussion has centered on how far from the Wood house <PERSON> Rogerson </PERSON> was when he shot Mrs. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, and why Mrs. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> was not wearing orange-colored clothing, recommended for the woods during hunting season. No arraignment date has been set for <PERSON> Rogerson </PERSON>, who faces up to 20 years' imprisonment if convicted, said Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hjelm </PERSON>. Chief Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilbreth </PERSON> said news stories which raised questions about the fairness of the first grand jury's decision prompted the state to present the case a second time. A nephew of <PERSON> Rogerson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vafiades </PERSON>, served on the first grand jury, and <PERSON> Kilbreth </PERSON> said that was `` the most important aspect'' of the decision to reopen the case. However, he stressed there was only the appearance of a conflict and an investigation by his office turned up no evidence of wrongdoing. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> settled a wrongful death lawsuit against <PERSON> Rogerson </PERSON> in May for $ 122,000. <PERSON> Vafiades </PERSON> described <PERSON> Rogerson </PERSON> as `` disappointed, obviously'' at Friday's grand jury action.

 <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON> was remembered for his vision, spirit and spice at a funeral service with dance and music that alternately mourned his passing and exuberantly celebrated his legacy to modern choreography. `` He made us believe we could fly,'' <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamison </PERSON>, a former lead dancer in <LOCATION> Ailey </LOCATION>'s company, told hundreds who gathered Friday in the <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> the Divine in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jamison </PERSON>, now a choreographer, called <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON>'s life `` a poem without words, in an improvised meter.'' <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON>, whose company performed for millions in 45 countries, died Dec. 1 at 58 of a rare blood disorder. The funeral service included somber organ music and African-tinged drumming, five dances by members of <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON>'s company and a song by <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>. Attending the service were scores of current and former members of the company, which under <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON>'s direction blended African, <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and gospel elements with jazz, modern dance and ballet. In a statement read to the gathering, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON>'s `` dedication to dance was singular and compelling.'' `` <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> was not only a pioneer in choreography but also a teacher, a man committed to weaving his African-American heritage into our nation's cultural tapestry,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Mayor-elect <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> called <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON> `` an apostle of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> culture for the rest of the world.'' `` Though he has left us, we all stand immeasurably enriched by his brief time among us,'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said. Before the service, current and former members of the troupe gathered in the cathedral basement to reminisce. `` He made dance accessible to everyone,'' said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON>, who danced with the company for eight years. `` You did n't have to have a trained eye or read a book _ all you had to do was open your heart. That's what <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> was all about, that spark of spirit.'' <PERSON> Nat </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, who danced with <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON> for five years, praised his `` ability to pull people's spirit out, getting people to communicate. His influence is going to be felt for many, many years.'' `` <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> was a spicy character, full of life, and a great mentor,'' said <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON>, another former dancer. `` He had a wild sense of humor, and he could be a pain in the neck. He had visions that, when you're young, you did n't see. But now we realize it.'' <PERSON> Babette </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffey-Fisch </PERSON>, a former dancer, said <PERSON> Ailey </PERSON>'s art was n't just for black dancers _ `` It was for anyone who had a soul, anyone who could express their spirit through movement.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen at <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> are roaming nearby streets and bars after their superiors lifted an order confining them to their quarters during an attempted coup by mutinous Philippine soldiers. `` Everybody is still real friendly'' toward the GIs, a senior airman from <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D'Alene </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, said today at the front gate of the sprawling base, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. F-4 Phantom jets from <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> flew air cover Dec. 1 for loyalist forces at the request of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, helping to thwart the revolt. The jets did not fire on the rebels but prevented them from continuing air strikes on the presidential palace and military camps in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> servicemen said they were restricted to the base or their off-base residences from Dec. 1 until Thursday and security was tightened. Troops also were told not to talk to reporters. A sergeant from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, who refused to identify himself further, said the general feeling on the base after the flights was, `` Oh oh, now for the first time we're actually involved. What's going to happen? What retribution is going to happen?'' Concern was not restricted to what the mutinous soldiers might do in response to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action. Soldiers said there also was concern about the Communist rebels active in the region, who are believed responsible for at least five slayings of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> GIs in recent years. But when travel off the base was resumed, the airmen rushed for the gates to the streets of <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, a city of dank honky-tonk bars and restaurants that cater largely to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> community of 10,000 active servicemen and about 16,000 dependants. The main strip features McDonald's, <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION>, Pizza Hut and <PERSON> Shakey </PERSON>'s restaurants `` When I heard at 20 minutes after 3 o'clock I could go off base, I was downtown by 4,'' said the sergeant. `` It was nice just to get out of the room again,'' said the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> airman, who also refused to give his name. Several soldiers in shorts and T-shirts strolled off the base this morning, shooing away vendors selling sunglasses or catching rides into town. One GI hurrying from the base was dressed in full baseball uniform with glove tucked under his arm. Angeles had been a ghost town during the days airmen were restricted to quarters, with many businesses shut down completely. An Australian bar owner said his business was down at least 60 percent. `` I would say it had a very big effect on the working girls'' in the bars, said <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Doggies </PERSON>, across the street from the base. He said prostitutes were particularly hard hit because the Christmas season traditionally is when they need money to send to their families in the provinces. In October 1987, the economy of this city in central <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> was devastated after troops were confined to barracks following the killings of three Americans by Communist rebels. <PERSON> Josie </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>, `` mama-san,'' or madam, at the <ORGANIZATION> Bombay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> down the street, also complained that business was `` so bad since Dec. 1. We had no GI customers.'' But Friday night, the bar was again filled with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen drinking <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> beer and shooting pool on the <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>'s two faded billiard tables. `` We still like Americans,'' the mama-san said, leaning across the bar for emphasis. `` We do n't want the business to go away.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has been sued by a family claiming the company spied on them, said it was only practicing the American way of product research. <PERSON> Maritza </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> claim fraud, invasion of privacy, trespassing and unfair business practices by <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Morimoto </PERSON>, a Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> employee who rented a room in their <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> home last summer. `` They feel violated, they really do,'' said the Frenches' attorney <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> `` They just wonder what he was writing down, what about their private lives is in a <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> file somewhere.'' <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> denied the couple's claims in a statement Friday from its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> is in the business of building cars,'' the company said. `` We try to build cars that meet the needs of Americans by studying the way Americans drive and buy their automobiles. `` That the media, the courts and our legal system are being tied up because Mr. <PERSON> Morimoto </PERSON> did research on how we buy and use cars is a truly regrettable situation.'' <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Morimoto </PERSON>, 29, was frank about the fact that he was a <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> employee `` and that he was in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to better understand <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lifestyles and attitudes about cars.'' <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> said that not only was <PERSON> Morimoto </PERSON> not secretive, `` he was plainly seen in the neighborhood photographing various cars, homes and garages.'' Ms. <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said the family was aware that <PERSON> Morimoto </PERSON> worked for <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> but thought he had been temporarily assigned to the company's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION>. The company's statement said, `` the saddest element'' of the litigation was `` that our judicial system would even allow -LRB- the lawsuit -RRB- to be filed.''

 Two suspended investigators of a county prosecutor's office were on the verge of pleading guilty to a single extortion charge nine weeks ago _ with the promise of probation for their sentence. Today they face more than 50 years in prison. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Maryanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> refused to accept the plea, saying it would violate her conscience in light of the charges' seriousness, and the case went to trial. A federal jury Friday convicted <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilsenan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicalese </PERSON> of conspiracy, racketeering, extortion and drug charges. The government said the <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> investigators protected a drug dealer in exchange for cocaine, cash and valuables. The jury largely accepted the word of the man the investigators protected: convicted drug-dealer and admitted murderer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> was the bulwark of the government's case. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the case was difficult, and authorities felt they had less than a 50 percent chance of victory at the trial's outset. `` It's always difficult to convict law enforcement officers of corruption,'' he said. <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> added that the verdict opened new `` avenues'' for investigation, and the probe into law enforcement corruption in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> would continue. He would not elaborate. The defendants showed no reaction when the verdict was announced. From the section where family and friends were sitting, sharp gasps could be heard. `` The word disappointment does n't do justice to this,'' said <PERSON> Gilsenan </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhnke </PERSON>. He and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Critchley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cicalese </PERSON>'s lawyer, promised appeals. <PERSON> Gilsenan </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Verona </LOCATION> was a detective in the <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor's office since 1971. <PERSON> Cicalese </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> is a former <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> police officer and worked in the investigator's office since 1984 Both were suspended after the indictment. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> set sentencing for Feb. 14. They face more than 50 years in prison terms. <PERSON> Gilsenan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cicalese </PERSON> were each found guilty of racketeering conspiracy, racketeering and drug and extortion conspiracy. <PERSON> Gilsenan </PERSON> was also convicted of nine individual extortion, drug and obstruction of justice counts and acquitted of 11 other counts. <PERSON> Cicalese </PERSON> was found guilty of 11 individual extortion and drug counts and was acquitted of six others. The crimes were committed between 1984 and 1986. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said that the two investigators tipped off <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> about a police informer in his organization, told him of wiretaps and protected him from arrest. In exchange, he said <PERSON> Cicalese </PERSON> received mainly cocaine and <PERSON> Gilsenan </PERSON> got cash, appliances, a car, suits and jewelry.

 Saving the Earth is not such a difficult thing. For instance, if Americans recycled all their Sunday newspapers it would save more than 500,000 trees a week. And with the junk mail Americans get each day _ 44 percent of which is never opened _ they could produce enough energy to heat 250,000 homes. Just pumping up tires to the right pressure would save about 2 billion gallons of gasoline a year. These and other practical points are listed in a book offered at the Earth Expo and <ORGANIZATION> Earth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, which opened Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and is aimed at offering tips to individuals on conserving earthly resources. It is the first of a series of fairs planned for seven cities. `` Most people believe that the problem is so overwhelming that no one person can do anything,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Javna </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Earth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` That's simply not true.'' His book, `` 50 Simple Things You Can Do To Save the Earth,'' appeared Nov. 1 and already has sold more than 100,000 copies. <PERSON> Javna </PERSON> and his book are crammed with `` pop facts,'' some of them downright scary. -LRB- For instance, <PERSON> Javna </PERSON> says there are more artificial chemicals in the average <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> home today than there were in the average chemical laboratory 100 years ago -RRB-. There are suggestions, too: <LOCATION> Mothballs </LOCATION> are made from 100 percent paradichlorobenzene, harmful to the liver and kidneys. Alternatives: Cedar chips or cedar oil work just fine. Another fair participant, pharmacist <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyerson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, has developed the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delivery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, specializing in products for people sensitive to the increasing number of chemicals in the home and elsewhere. `` This is the first generation to be exposed so totally to chemical products _ chemicals, dyes, preservatives, contaminants in the water,'' he said. His company markets water-based paints and dyes, water and air filters and biodegradable products such as soaps, adhesives and cleaners. Show coordinator <PERSON> Zenia </PERSON> <PERSON> Richler </PERSON>, who researched the applicants and pared the list to about 68 based on credibility, said many of the new products, such as biodegradable cellulose bags that resemble plastic but are made from plant fiber, still are more expensive than their synthetic counterparts because they are n't yet mass-produced. The biodegradable plastics also raise environmental concerns. For one, the material breaks down into plastic particles that may contain toxic metals such as cadmium and lead. For another, recycling centers are refusing degradable plastics because they are not as strong as plastics do n't degrade, thus contaminating the recyclable mix. The fair also includes displays for reusable diapers that have the convenience of disposables, herbal skin creams, insulation that does not use fiberglass and an attractive bench made completely of recycled plastics. For a fee Watercheck, of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, will check your tap water for over 90 contaminants and send you a printout of the results. If your water flunks, <PERSON> Watercheck </PERSON> recommends seeing a qualified water treatment specialist. Entrepreneurs say the problem of impure water is getting worse as more and more dangerous chemicals go into landfill dumps and find their way back into the water system. `` The water systems ca n't keep up with the chemicals that are going into them,'' Ms. <PERSON> Richler </PERSON> said.

The former president strolled the <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mall </ORGANIZATION> on a shopping excursion on Friday, buying stuffed toys for underprivileged children and even a few treats for himself. Startled shoppers along the poinsettia-lined open-air mall broke out in wide smiles at the sight of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> meandering down the concourse. Some waved. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stopped to shake hands, nuzzle infants and sign autographs. With his half-dozen <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents leading the way, he journeyed to a candy store to buy a 5-pound box of chocolates for the White House switchboard operators. There was a 9-inch chocolate <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, too. `` I'm sure she'll like this better than the diamond bracelet,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was next off to his favorite store _ Blue Chip Cookies. Asked if the $ 9.75 worth of chocolate chip cookies were for him, he said, `` Yep, mainly me.'' `` I like everything about Christmas,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said when asked if he enjoyed shopping after eight years of security-minded limitations. `` There were a lot of restrictions before.''

<HEAD>Search Continues For Missing Crewmen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rescue ships fought raging winds and towering waves early today in search of survivors from two cargo ships that sank in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION>. There was no sign of 39 crew members from the ships, which sank about 125 miles apart. Search and rescue efforts were hampered by high winds, heavy seas, bitter cold, snow and poor visibility. `` As the hours wear on the possibilies of survival become much decreased,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>. Coast Guard officials said the 400-foot Capitaine <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> and 270-foot <PERSON> Johanna </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON> disappeared Thursday night in rough seas about 120 miles apart and north of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Breton </LOCATION>. It said all of the 23 crewmen aboard the Capitaine <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> and 16 on the <PERSON> Johanna </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON> were foreigners, including many Filipinos. On Friday, searchers said they came within sight of some of the seaman aboard the Capitaine <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, which foundered about 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Breton </LOCATION>. Pepper said the captain of the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter Sir <PERSON> Wilfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Grenfell </PERSON> spotted survivors on a life raft. `` He saw them waving,'' said Pepper. `` He could n't get to them right away ... as he was maneuvering the ship he saw two very high breakers hit the raft itself, sweep through it. By the time he got back around and recovered the raft there were no personnel on it.'' The <PERSON> Grenfell </PERSON> spotted several life jackets, the wreckage of a wooden life raft and two empty rubber rafts. The fourth life raft on the ship was not accounted for on Friday night. The Capitaine <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> was crewed by French, Fijian, Dutch and Filipino men as well as sailors from the small <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> republic of <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>, where the ship is registered. The Capitaine <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> had sent a distress call saying the cargo had shifted, some of it tumbling over overboard, causing it to list badly. The ship said the crew was abandoning ship in enclosed rubber rafts about 36 miles north of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Breton </LOCATION>. The Capitaine <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> was carrying general container cargo from <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. A cargo container _ the size of a boxcar _ can weigh several tons when fully loaded. The <PERSON> Johanna </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON> was carrying pig iron when it radioed for help. The ship was destined for <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Passing commercial ships continued this morning to join the search by matching their courses with coordinates set by the search and rescue center, and keeping a lookout, said a rescue official. Some crew aboard the <PERSON> Grenfell </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ships returned to work in spite of a month-old strike by civilian crew members of federal government ships, including coast guard and fisheries vessels.

<HEAD>25 Children Injured in Subway Escalator Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A child's clothing became ensnared in an escalator at a subway station, causing an emergency stop that sent screaming children tumbling backward, police said. At least 25 children were injured, none seriously. About 60 fourth and fifth graders were riding the escalator Friday at a subway station in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on their way back from a trip to see the giant Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center, officials said. A child's clothing became snagged at the top of the escalator, said transit police spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>. `` The kids began stacking up and someone, possibly two people, hit an emergency stop button,'' <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> said, attributing the report to an officer at the scene. A homeless man who saw the accident was credited with pulling some of the children to safety. `` I was scared,'' said one of the children, 9-year-old <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Narvaez </PERSON>. `` I thought I would slip into the bottom of the escalator. I was afraid I was going to be eaten up.'' <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> said it was n't clear who may have pushed the stop button, adding it could have been one of the teachers who accompanied the students. `` Pandemonium, in short,'' said transit officer Sgt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Capaldo </PERSON>. `` They were all crying, upset and confused.'' A spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Bellevue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, said one child may have broken an ankle. Another had a possible broken leg. Ten other children were treated at the hospital for bumps and bruises. All were between the ages of 9 and 11, he said. Other children were taken to hospitals after complaining about injuries once they returned to school, increasing the number of injured beyond 25, police said. No other serious injuries were reported.

<HEAD>Mass Murderer Was a Crack Shot, Best Friend Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The man who killed 14 women at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> engineering school was a crack shot who used to shoot pigeons as they flew, said a childhood friend. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Lepine </PERSON>, whose rampage Wednesday at the university's engineering school ended when he shot himself, was an electronics buff who dreamed of being an engineer, said friend <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Belanger </PERSON> But he really exceled in hunting, said <PERSON> Belanger </PERSON>, 24, recalling how they used to hunt pigeons together as teen-agers with BB guns. `` He was good at it _ better than me. He saw a pigeon flying and he used to be able to shoot it while it was flying ... not every time, but most of the time,'' <PERSON> Belanger </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Lepine </PERSON> likely learned to shoot from an uncle who had trained with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Green Berets and had been a Canadian Forces paratrooper, a source close to the family said Friday. `` Apparently the way he used the rifle there was n't one lost shot,'' the source said, adding that <PERSON> Lepine </PERSON> often visited the uncle on his sheep farm after his parents broke up. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Lepine </PERSON>, carrying a semi-automatic hunting rifle, used only 35 to 37 bullets to kill the 14 and wound 13 people, killing most of the women with shots to the head. A three-page letter blaming women for his failures in life was found beside his body. <PERSON> Lepine </PERSON> grew up with a brutal father who had a total disdain for women and believed they were intended only to serve men, his mother told a 1976 divorce hearing. The couple stopped living together in 1971, when <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> was 7 years old, and a divorce was finally granted in 1978. The marriage so scarred <PERSON> Monique </PERSON> <PERSON> Lepine </PERSON>, her son, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON>, and her daughter, <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON>, that they spent a year in psychotherapy. `` We had difficulties expressing love,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lepine </PERSON> told her divorce hearing. <PERSON> Belanger </PERSON> agreed. `` I always tried to get <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> to get himself a girlfriend, to find out what girls were all about, but he had a lot of problems with that,'' <PERSON> Belanger </PERSON> said. `` It's not that he was n't interested.'' He described his friend, with whom he lost touch when <PERSON> Lepine </PERSON> moved to another part of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> in his late teens, as fascinated with electronics. `` His ideal was to be an electronics engineer or a computer engineer _ he was interested in both,'' he said. Police said <PERSON> Lepine </PERSON>, 25, an unemployed hospital worker, wanted to go the engineering school where he went on his rampage but there is no evidence he applied for admission.

<BYLINE>By GARY L. CARTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In 1973, a woman known in court papers as <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> won the right to an abortion, in a landmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling released the same day as the more famous <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> case. By then the woman had decided against the abortion and given the baby girl up for adoption; she had also lost custody of two earlier children. Today <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> _ whose real name is <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> _ is ending her separation with the last of the three children, closing a process of reunification that parallels the turnaround in her stance to an anti-abortion position. Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>'s first daughter, April, 22, was flying to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> today for their first meeting in 17 years, Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> said. Earlier this year, Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> was reunited with her daughter <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, whom she gave up for adoption in 1970 after deciding not to go ahead with an abortion. She was reunited with her son, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>, 12 years ago. Her desire for the abortion had thrust Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> into the history books as the anonymous plaintiff <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> in the <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> case. The court's decision, which struck down <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s restrictive anti-abortion law, was issued Jan. 22, 1973, the same day the court struck down <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' abortion law in Roe vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> The two older children, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> and April, were taken from the woman a year before that. She said she lost custody of the children after a dispute with a baby sitter and `` because of me being young and naive.'' She launched a battle to regain custody of <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> and April from the family they had been placed with and attained partial success when she got the boy 12 years ago, when he was 11. Child welfare officials thought it best that April not rejoin the family, Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> said. She had managed to track the adoptive parents to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> and then <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, but hit a dead end eight years ago. In November, a week after Thanksgiving, April called. Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> said her daughter told her she had been trying to find her mother since being abandoned by her adoptive family and placed in a mental hospital at age 14. She said her adoptive father, who refused to have anything to do with her, was the one who finally told her to contact <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> social services, leading her to her birth mother. Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> said April told her stories of abuse, confirming the fears that had fueled her long search for the girl. After she identified herself publicly as the case's <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> in February, Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> said, her car was shot at, two trucks were stolen and graffiti was scrawled on another vehicle. Ironically, Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> no longer holds a pro-choice stand. In fact, she said, now that her family is back together she plans to increase her involvement in the anti-abortion movement, which has invited her to represent her position on talk shows and at meetings. `` I'm going to start coming out, start speaking out and being more active now, because we've got the children back,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> said. `` Not many people get that second chance.''

 Prime Minister V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> assured Sri Lankan officials that he wants improved ties with their government, but <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is illegally arming a paramilitary force in the island nation. After <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> met with Sri Lankan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> on Friday, the two sides issued a statement saying `` the whole spirit should be one of trust and of a joint endeavor.'' Although <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> stressed <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> would soon end its 2 -LCB- - year military deployment in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said a major sticking point remained: <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s alleged arming of a new Tamil militia, whose existence has been outlawed by <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s Speaking to reporters after his meeting with <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said: `` I made a complaint that the so-called <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, numbering about 4,000, had been trained and armed by the IPKF -LRB- <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping force -RRB- without the authorization and knowledge of the Sri Lankan government.'' The joint communique said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> had taken note of the concerns and that a response would be conveyed `` after a full examination of all issues.'' The Sri Lankan government, as well as local residents, have accused the departing Indian troops of providing automatic rifles, mortars and rockets to the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has attacked Moslems in areas already vacated by Indians and has clashed with a rival Tamil militia in other regions still patrolled by Indians, according to witnesses and Sri Lankan officials. Both <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said they expected the Indian pullout to be completed as previously agreed by the end of December. <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> estimated about 25,000 Indian soldiers were still in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, although other estimates place the number as high as 36,000. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who took office Saturday, told reporters earlier: `` Having good relations with <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> is the first priority of the present government.'' Instead of playing its envisioned role as peacemaker and supervising a docile surrender of arms by Tamil separatists, the Indian troops bogged down in the jungle war since they entered <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> following an Indian-Sri Lankan pact to end the Tamil insurgency in 1987. At least 1,100 Indian soldiers were among the 17,000 people killed in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s tangle of ethnic and political struggles since 1983. About 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people are Tamils, most of whom are Hindus. Sinhalese are mostly Buddhists and comprise 75 percent of the population. Tamils complain they are discriminated against in jobs and education.

<HEAD>Soviet Central Committee Meeting Opens Amid Speculation of Shakeups</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Senior Communist Party officials met today amid speculation about a leadership shake-up and growing calls for the party to give up its domination of Soviet life. Rumors of leadership changes always precede meetings of the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> because it is the only body empowered to make changes in the ruling Politburo. But the rumors were bolstered by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders' increasingly embattled position as they struggle to keep the once-monolithic party from losing its clout and breaking into factions. Challenges to the party's dominance came from independent-minded Communists in outlying republics and prominent lawmakers who have called for a brief strike Monday to force the issue. <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> on Thursday became the first republic in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to drop a constitutional guarantee of Communist supremacy and substitute a multi-party system. Human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and several other members of the Soviet Parliament have urged a brief general strike Monday to call on lawmakers to drop the constitution's Article 6, which guarantees the party the `` leading and guiding role'' in society. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, scrambling to enact democratic reforms to staunch huge anti-government rallies, have cut out similar provisions from their constitutions. In <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, an estimated 40,000 rank-and-file Communists rallied this week to support President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> against what they said was a bid by conservatives to oust him. Officially, today's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> meeting was to address only questions on economic reform and party organization to prepare for a meeting of the full Soviet Parliament three days later. A meeting of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> city party on Friday indicated that if the party also raised the issue of Article 6, it might show new willingness to consider giving it up. Almost all the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party leaders quoted in today's newspapers said they were ready to see the article either canceled or altered. Even <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON> agreed `` we are for replacing this article of the U.S.S.R. constitution,'' but he also condemned `` extremist forces'' for pushing the question in order to hurt the party, <ORGANIZATION> Moskovskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Prokovfiev </PERSON> called <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s article last month on new ideas about Communism and perestroika `` was so very necessary to the party and society and was clearly late.'' He also criticized the anti-alcohol campaign <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> launched soon after coming to power in 1985. Communist demonstrators at a rally in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> aimed their own shots at <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the Politburo, furthering the impression of a growing schism in the party. The Nov. 22 party-organized rally, where some speakers and slogans accused <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of abandoning the party and Communist ideology, elicited a counter-rally by progressives Wednesday. Prior to the Wednesday protest, activists handed out leaflets warning that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his closest allies in the Politburo, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, could lose their party jobs at today's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commmittee </ORGANIZATION> meeting, said activist <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s approximately 350 full and non-voting members could remove <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> from his post as party chief. However, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> enjoys a measure of security, since he has strengthened the power of the government and has been elected to a five-year term as president.

<HEAD>State, EPA Sign Rocky Flats Cleanup Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDY SHORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A draft agreement that for the first time assigns responsibilities for the cleanup of the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> nuclear weapons plant has been signed by two governmental agencies overseeing the contaminated complex. A third agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, put off signing the document until next week because of a minor financial snag. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> on Friday signed the document, a blueprint for carrying out cleanup priorities agreed upon in principle by Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> and DOE Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> in June. Cleanup of contamination is estimated to cost $ 500 million to $ 1 billion and to take more than a decade, officials said. `` We can feel very comfortable that what we're signing here has been agreed upon as an interagency agreement and just needs that final OK, which we will assume will come early next week,'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> regional administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Simonson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s Rocky Flats office said he expected to sign the agreement early next week. `` I think it's a good agreement for all of us. It sets out what will be done. It sets out the regulatory framework for environmental work at Rocky Flats,'' <PERSON> Simonson </PERSON> said. The agreement, in draft form until it is finalized after a 60-day public comment period, coordinates state and federal environmental laws to ensure the cleanup of waste at the plant 16 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. It also establishes, for the first time, schedules for the study and cleanup of contaminated sites. `` What we have here is a step forward in this interagency agreement that allows us to put a very strict group of schedules and work plans together so that actual cleanup action ... can begin almost immediately,'' <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Looby </PERSON>, assistant state health department director, said the agreement resolved a number of issues that have snagged the cleanup of other federal facilities by integrating the responsibilities under the federal Superfund Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. In addition, the agreement requires DOE to comply with state hazardous waste laws, he said. `` I think that by virtue of this cooperative approach of recognizing the state's environmental laws, we are in the position of making sure we get the cleanup that's necessary,'' he said. The DOE plant manufactures triggers for nuclear weapons. In June, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> raided the plant, looking for evidence of alleged illegal hazardous waste handling. A federal grand jury is weighing the case, but has not issued indictments. This fall, <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> replaced <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as contractor at the plant. EG & amp; G is scheduled to take over in January. Under the agreement, <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> will investigate the extent of contamination at 178 sites on and off the plant site to evaluate and prioritize cleanup activities. A 60-day comment period will begin Dec. 22 to give the public time to offer opinions on the agreement.

<HEAD>Immigration Officials Want to Deport Salvadoran Hunger Striker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The immigration service has refused to grant residency to a Salvadoran who has been living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for eight years and is currently on a hunger strike to protest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> was involved in terrorism while in the Salvadoran military and should not have received the temporary residency status granted him in 1987. The notification was mailed to <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> this week by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s letter said the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> reconsidered <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>'s case last spring when he applied to upgrade his residency status from temporary to permanent <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> was informed that he was ineligible for temporary or permanent residency because `` you participated in killing, rape and torture.'' The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> cited newspaper accounts of <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>'s interviews and speeches as evidence of his past involvement in terrorism as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, one of the Salvadoran police agencies now being supported by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> fled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1981 after being discharged from the Salvadoran military. He claims to have undergone a spiritual conversion that led him to confess his actions and speak out against abuses by the Salvadoran military. He has been under the protection of a local church since 1982. <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> has never denied that he was involved in acts of brutality but claims he never killed anyone. <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> is an assumed name used by the man to avoid reprisals against relatives still living in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> and others are in their third week of a hunger strike at the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>. He was resting Friday and unavailable for an interview, church officials said. `` We find it more than coincidental that the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> is taking this action at this time,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Berneking </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Wayzata </LOCATION>, which shelters <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> She said a letter-writing campaign had been started to protect him. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>'s attorneys, agreed. He said the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> had spent six months investigating <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>'s background before he was granted temporary residency status on Dec. 16, 1987. `` And now they do this, two years after -LRB- granting residency status -RRB- and at a time when <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Rene </PERSON>, are back in the news,'' <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiltgen </PERSON>, acting director of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> office in the Twin Cities, said `` it was our position all along that -LRB- <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> -RRB- was n't eligible.

 At least six people died in weather-related accidents when a pre-winter storm dumped up to 9 inches of snow and sleet on <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> had forecast up to a foot of snow throughout much of central <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and up to 15 inches in the mountains, but less than that had fallen before the service canceled its winter storm warning for most of the state late Friday night. `` For all practical purposes, it's over,'' said meteorologist <PERSON> Hurtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the weather service in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. Two men died on a state highway in central <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in a collision blamed on a slick spot on the highway. On <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> highways, four people including a 3-year-old boy died in separate accidents Friday. Snowfall ranged from 1 inch in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> News </LOCATION> to 9 inches in Staunton. The storm closed schools and sent office workers home early around <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> said no highways were closed, `` but we have many, many miles that are treacherous.'' The storm left parts of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> covered by up to 6 inches of snow, and was expected to drop 8 inches on <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shore </ORGANIZATION> before it played out today. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, was dusted with a few inches of snow that led the federal government to close some offices early. Airline officials reported some delays out of airports in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> canceled its arriving and departing flights from the <LOCATION> Raleigh-Durham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after 6 p.m., according to airport spokeswoman <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Damiano </PERSON>, although the airport remained open. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was predicting more storms next week. `` Right now, we're looking at a potential storm for Monday and another for Wednesday in the East,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Belville </PERSON>, meteorologist in charge of the weather service's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office. `` We could end up with a one-two punch along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>.'' `` The eastern part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has had an abnormal amount of severe storms this year,'' <LOCATION> Belville </LOCATION> said.

<HEAD>Boeing Forming Division for New Widebody Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> plans to build a new wide-body jetliner called the 777 even though it has no orders from airlines. The 350-passenger twin-engine jet, seating 10 people across, will be designed to compete with <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s MD-11 and the <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> A-330. It would be larger than the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 767 but smaller than the 747 jumbo jet. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials on Friday estimated a $ 100 billion market for the new plane, which initially would be marketed to replace aging transcontinental carriers. It is the first <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jet totally designed by computer. It may be built in partnership with three Japanese aerospace companies. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Commercial Airplanes President <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said he was creating a new division to develop and market the plane <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> now calls the 767-X. If the plane enters production, it will be called the 777. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> hopes to offer the new plane by 1995, if enough airline interest is shown, <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said. The last new model number <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> introduced was the 757, which entered service in 1983, although the long-range 747-400, which began deliveries early this year, is essentially a new aircraft. <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is far from committed to actually building the aircraf. But he said seven or eight carriers had expressed strong interest, and another dozen were interested to a lesser degree. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest commercial jet builder, had record profits in its most recent quarter and has a backlog of more than 1,700 firm jet orders, with deliveries stretching into the next century.

<TEXT>
 Attacks by leftist guerrillas cut power supplies in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and left a city hall in flames south of the capital. In another development Friday, a judge ordered that American <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> and seven Salvadorans remain jailed for 90 days while an investigation continues into their possible links to a cache of ammunition and explosives. The capital's power supply was cut by half and electricity was being rationed to industrial users Friday after the rebels dynamited eight main power lines, the national power company said. The <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lempa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hydroelectric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said rebel sabotage had caused severe service disruptions in <LOCATION> Sal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and elsewhere. Rebels often blow down power lines and pylons as part of a 10-year-old civil war in which more than 71,000 people have been killed. A statement from the army press office said rebels attacked government forces early Friday in <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION> province, 55 miles north <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. It said 17 guerrillas and one soldier were killed. Rebels also set fire to the city hall, telephone office and a gasoline station in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Transito </LOCATION>, 75 miles southeast of the capital, but no casualties were reported, the army said. Friday's fighting was the lightest since guerrillas began an offensive Nov. 11 aimed primarily at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. More than 1,000 soldiers, rebels and civilians have been killed in the offensive. The legislature of the U.S.-supported government on Friday extended for another 30 days a state-of-siege approved after the offensive began. The emergency, imposed Nov. 12 for 30 days, suspends constitutional guarantees. The court order Friday extended the detention of <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, a 28-year-old native of <LOCATION> Thomaston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, who was arrested Nov. 25 when police found more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition along with explosives and detonator caps buried in the backyard of the home she rented. She and the other Salvadorans, one of whom is still at large, have been charged with terrorism, criminal and subversive association and possession of weapons of war, court secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> said. Judge <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> of the 1st Military Court ordered the prisoners held for 90 days during which the defense and prosecution collect and present evidence. The judge then decides if there is sufficient evidence to order a public trial. No bond was set for the defendants. Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, who has represented the Texas-based <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminars </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> for nearly five years, says she rented the house three months ago, traveled much of the time, and knew nothing about hidden munitions.

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Communists gave in to the forces of reform today and elected <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>, a lawyer for the pro-democracy opposition, as their new leader. <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> said the Communists now consider themselves one political force among several in planned elections that will determine the country's future. `` I am convinced that we are a reformed party and will have good chances,'' he told reporters. `` We will fight for votes and we are ready for coalition.'' <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> pledged to move the party toward democratic socialism. `` It's clear to us that a monopoly capitalist path is as questionable as a Stalinist path,'' he told a news conference after his selection. The Communists have lost much of their control over society in recent weeks and have granted historic concessions to the opposition, including opening the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and other borders, in a desperate effort to remain in power. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>: _ <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s Communist premier said half of the new government he will propose may include people with no ties to any party, making the Communists a minority for the first time in four decades _ Senior <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials met today in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> amid speculation about a leadership shake-up and growing calls for the party to abandon its domination of Soviet life _ <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> expelled more of the old guard from its leadership Friday, leaving the ruling Politburo with only three members who were there when <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> was fired as party chief Nov. 10 In a historic 16-hour party congress, the East German Communists voted to change the party's name but refused calls to disband the organization that has ruled <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for four decades. Party spokeswoman <PERSON> Brigitte </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON>, briefing reporters on the closed session of the emergency congress, said earlier that <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> was the only candidate to become the party's third leader in less than two months. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said 95.3 percent of the 2,714 delegates participating voted for <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> in balloting that took 5 -LCB- hours. In a statement, the party congress also apologized to the East German people because the former leadership `` has led our country into this crisis threatening its existence.'' In a secret ballot, delegates also chose other members in a new 100-member party leadership over which <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> will preside. <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>, 41, a bespectacled, blunt-talking intellectual, is the youngest <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. He has backed sweeping political and economic reforms and has acted as lawyer for the opposition group New Forum. He was a member of the interim party leadership and is heading a committee investigating corruption under the ousted leadership. <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> is an avid supporter of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` glasnost'' policy of a more open and free society. He has said the word `` glasnost belongs in the German vocabulary.'' The opposition and the Communists have proposed national elections be held May 6. `` We need a full break with failed Stalinism,'' <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> told party delegates Friday night. He said past leaders had enjoyed `` frightening'' privileges while the country plunged into a deep political and economic crisis. <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>, in his address to the congress, urged `` free competition'' in society. He called for a younger, less bureaucratic leadership oriented toward `` grass-roots democracy'' and building a `` new democratic socialist party.'' He called the idea of German reunification, backed by many anti-government demonstrators and the West German government, as `` nonsensical.'' <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>'s nomination comes one day after criminal charges were announced against former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and five of his ousted lieutenants. The ailing <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, ousted Oct. 18 and later expelled from the party, was under house arrest and his associates were jailed. He was replaced by <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, who instituted reform but was forced to step down this week because of his long-time association with <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s disgraced administation. The party's new platform and name were due to be discussed when the congress reconvenes Dec. 23. The delegates voted 3-1 to change the name of the party but had not agreed on a new name. Bitter debate at the congress reflected the rifts in the party. Ms. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said the party's membership had dropped from 2.3 million to less than 1.8 million in recent months. <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON>, a non-Communist who is <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s interim president, called for nationwide elections `` as soon as possible.'' <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> also said he hoped all Soviet troops could be withdrawn from the Communist nation in three years, according to Rep. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>. The visiting <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat said <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> made the comment in a meeting with five other <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Congressmen.

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>, is an articulate reformer and the youngest Communist leader in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>, 41, was overwhelmingly elected party chairman today. He was born Jan. 16, 1948, in the Soviet sector of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. After completing high school, <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> studied law at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Humboldt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> He graduated in 1970, then worked for a year as a legal assistant. In 1971, <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> began practicing as a defense lawyer dealing primarily in civil, labor and business cases. He has been chief of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> since 1988 and also serves as the head of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 15 other attorney boards. Most recently, <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> represented the citizens' initiative New Forum when the opposition group was seeking official recognition in October. East German officials at the time declared New Forum illegal and called its members `` enemies of the state.'' However, <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> insisted that rejection of New Forum's application to formally register as a legally allowed organization violated East German statutes, and the group was later officially registered. Following the mass resignation of the 10-man Communist Party Politburo and 163-man <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday, <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> was named to the 25-member leadership committee to restructure the shattered party. <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> is the son of <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>, who had been Secretary of State for Religious Affairs until he retired in the early 1980s. <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> is an avid supporter of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s glasnost policy of a more open and free society. At a Nov. 4 rally of about 1 million in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Platz </PERSON>, a large square in city center, <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> said the word `` glasnost belongs in the German vocabulary.'' <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> is divorced and the father of two children.

<TEXT>
 Leaders of the European Community today said they supported German reunification after receiving assurances that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will not seek claim to territories the German states held before World War II. `` We seek the establishment of a state of peace in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in which the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> people will regain its unity through free self-determination,'' said a draft of the 12-nation summit's political declaration The draft was completed after a tense dinner conversation Friday in which West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said his nation would not seek claim to German-speaking areas outside the German countries. Many Europeans fear the emergence of a united, more powerful <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s mighty economy already dominates the continent. Reunification now seems possible because of the dramatic changes taking place in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The nation has loosened travel restrictions, opened the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, thrown out hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders, and stripped the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of its constitutionally guaranteed hold on power. French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said at the two-day summit's closing news conference today that reunification was acceptable. `` I am not afraid of reunification,'' he said. `` I consider it to be legitimate.'' But he also said that countries must adhere to international treaties and other obligations `` unless they are prepared to create dangerous and unnecessary tensions.'' On Friday, the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> leaders agreed to negotiations for a system of central banks and eventually a single European currency. They approved a social charter on the rights of labor unions, wages and welfare. Both were approved over strong opposition from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. French Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> said <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and several other delegations initially rejected West German phrasing on reunification. The crucial moment came at Friday night's dinner when Dutch Prime Minister <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> and Italian Prime Minister <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> pressed <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> for his definition of reunification. Belgian and Dutch sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> made clear that in his view, reunification applied only to the two existing German nations and not to German-speaking areas in neighboring countries. Belgian Prime Minister <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> described the confrontation as `` the most tense moment of the summit.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> accepted <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s definition, and French diplomats went to work on redrafting the declaration on <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The draft declaration says reunification `` should take place democratically and peacefully, and on the basis of all the principles defined by the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act, in a context of dialogue and East-West cooperation.'' The 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords on European cooperation and security fix post-war borders. The leaders also said they must draw closer `` in this crucial period for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' `` It is in the interest of all European states that the Community should become stronger and accelerate its progress toward union,'' the draft declaration said. No formal votes were taken Friday, and only Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> objected during the closed-door discussions on the monetary conference and the social charter. The decision to move toward economic and monetary union means the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> will convene a special conference in December 1990 to start negotiations for the adoption of a single currency and a system of central banks. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> overrode objections by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> that radical monetary integration will rob member countries of sovereign rights to decide national economic policy. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will attend the conference in what <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> aides described as a `` spirit of constructive argument.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said the non-binding `` social charter'' for the rights of labor unions would increase unemployment, raise costs and make <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> goods less competitive.

 A ruptured pipeline sent up a cloud of propane gas and forced the evacuation of about 600 people overnight, including the entire village of <LOCATION> Butler </LOCATION>. Officials evacuated a six-mile area around the village Friday evening as a precaution in case the gas ingited and exploded. Valves that supply a <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> 66 pipeline were shut off, but gas already in the system was still leaking several hours later, said <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Shreve </PERSON>. Officials found the cloud to be dissipating by sunrise and allowed residents back to their homes shortly after 7 a.m., police said. No injuries were reported. A farmer broke the pipe while cutting through the field with a chisel plow, sheriff's deputies said. Firefighters said the land where the break occurred belongs to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Rundquist </PERSON>, who was recently appointed the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. The propane pipeline runs from <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The leak site is about a mile from Butler, which is about 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` I was working on a hill that overlooks that area,'' said farmer <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Faller </PERSON>, 38, who was evacuated with his wife and two children. `` I saw a huge cloud starting to appear, very low to the ground, very dense.'' <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> sent a repair crew to fix the pipeline, <PERSON> Shreve </PERSON> said. Electrical power and gas to <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> was turned off for a time to avoid sparks that could ignite the gas, said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, a nearby <LOCATION> Hillsboro </LOCATION> volunteer firefighter. A small fire did break out, but it was extinguished immediately, he said. `` It's a pretty large leak,'' <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> had said. `` There is already a vapor cloud of 15 acres. If it ignites, that's a heck of a fire.'' Authorities went from farmhouse to farmhouse to tell residents to leave, and provided a school bus to move those who lacked transportation.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s new president has moved further toward reform than his predecessors, but there's a long way yet to go to end apartheid, delegates at an anti-apartheid conference were told today `` We know he has limits beyond which he will not go,'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said, referring to President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>. `` It is our historic purpose to take him there or to go on without him.'' About 4,500 delegates filled a university hall for the Conference for a Democratic Future, the largest such conference ever held in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The black, white, Indian and mixed-race delegates represented roughly 2,100 organizations _ some of them ideological rivals in past years. `` Your diversity is our strength,'' said <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, a senior leader of the guerrilla movement. `` The gigantic task of this conference is to confirm the crucial importance of unity, and to plan a program of mass action ... that will challenge the apartheid state.'' Decisions reached at the daylong conference are expected to be announced Sunday. Last year, the government prohibited a similar conference shortly before it was to take place but allowed this convention even though many participants belong to groups which are banned. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, 77, and six other <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders were freed unconditionally in October by <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> after long prison terms. But <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> had no praise for the president or the white-controlled government's offer to negotiate some form of black political rights that stops short of majority rule. `` Mr. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, your back is to the wall,'' <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> said. `` Come stand on the floor of a conference like this. ... Submit to the processes of democracy.'' Observers from 19 foreign countries attended the conference, including <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Knut </PERSON> <PERSON> Wollenback </PERSON>, and a Soviet professor, <PERSON> Irina </PERSON> <PERSON> Filatova </PERSON>. It was the first time in at least 40 years that a Soviet appeared at an opposition meeting in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` We reiterate our commitment to one person, one vote in a united <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as the non-negotiable principle on which a future <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will be built,'' <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> said. `` The regime ... has done its utmost to break us: whipping our people, declaring the states of emergency, assassinating and detaining our leaders,'' <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> said. `` And it has failed. We gather here in greater numbers than ever before.'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosala </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consciousness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Azania </ORGANIZATION>, took a more militant line in his speech to the conference. `` A message must go out from this conference that the struggle is not about to be abandoned in favor of negotiations,'' he said. `` The aim of the struggle is not to negotiate _ it is to eradicate apartheid and capitalism.''

 Israeli soldiers shot and killed two Arabs in this village today during a march by hundreds of people marking the start of the third year of the Palestinian uprising. The protest was one of only a few demonstrations reported amid the widespread curfews imposed by the army to try to prevent violence in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> during a general strike ordered by PLO-backed leaders of the uprising. In <PERSON> Beni </PERSON> <PERSON> Naim </PERSON>, soldiers were seen opening fire with tear gas and then with bullets after masked youths began stoning troops and border police on the edge of the village. <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Fattah </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Manasra </PERSON>, 22, was shot in the chest, according to officials at <LOCATION> Alieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. Witnesses identified the other victim as <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Humeidat </PERSON>, 28. At least one other person was reported shot and wounded during the march through the village by hundreds of youths waving banners and outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags. After the woman's death, her body was retrieved from the hospital and more than 1,000 villagers marched to a cemetery in <PERSON> Beni </PERSON> <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> to bury the victim. The village of 13,000 people is 3 -LCB- miles east of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. `` With our souls, with our bodies, we will revenge you <PERSON> Sara </PERSON>,'' the crowd chanted. The marchers persisted despite army announcements over loudspeakers that the village was under curfew and all residents must return to their homes. Military officials confirmed that two people were killed and one wounded in <PERSON> Beni </PERSON> <PERSON> Naim </PERSON>. One official said troops opened fire after demonstrators pelted them with rocks and stones `` from all kinds of places.'' The deaths raised to 628 the number of Palestinians who have been killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers or civilians since the uprising started in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Jebaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp on Dec. 8, 1987. Forty-three Israelis also have been slain, and 155 other Palestinians were killed by fellow Arabs on suspicion they collaborated with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Army and police spokesmen reported no other major violence today. Stores and businesses were closed and traffic was largely halted in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, home to 1.7 million Palestinians. To head off trouble, the army and police stepped up forces in the occupied lands and <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and kept hundreds of thousands of Palestinians confined to their homes. Curfews were maintained for a third day on the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, home to 750,000 people, and for an ninth day on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, with a population of 120,000.

 Moslem separatists who kidnapped the daughter of a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister today threatened to kill her if five of their jailed colleagues are not freed. It was the first crisis faced by the week-old government of Prime Minister V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. Officials said commandos and negotiators were sent to <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> state to seek the release of <PERSON> Rubaiya </PERSON> <PERSON> Mufti </PERSON>, daughter of Home Minister <PERSON> Mufti </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, who was abducted Friday. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Kashmir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> demanded the release of five jailed members of the group, which seeks secession of the northeastern state from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. `` If our demands are not accepted by 7 p.m. Monday -LRB- 8:30 a.m. EST -RRB-, we will throw her body within the municipal limit of <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>,'' the kidnappers said in a statement to newspaper offices. <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>, the summer capital of <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state, is a tourist resort 95 miles north of <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION>, the state's winter capital. The Urdu-language statement issued by the kidnappers also said relatives of police officers would be kidnapped if the demands were not met. <PERSON> Rubaiya </PERSON> was kidnapped three days after her father was appointed home minister and a day after he was asked to head a government committee to resolve separatism issues in <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Soon after taking office on Dec. 2, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> promised to resolve such regional conflicts. Officials said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s government had formed a five-member negotiating team to seek <PERSON> Rubaiya </PERSON>'s release. `` We are trying to talk to the kidnappers, but we are yet to establish contact with them,'' a Home Ministry official in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> said on condition of anonymity. Officials in <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION> said the team was headed by an army colonel, but they did not release his name. Police began search operations in <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>. `` We have announced a red alert across the state,'' said police Chief <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeelani </PERSON> <PERSON> Pandit </PERSON>. `` We are keeping the option of a military action open,'' he said without elaborating. Commandos flown from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> had been asked to stand by, he said. <PERSON> Rubaiya </PERSON>, a 22-year-old medical student and intern at a <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION> hospital, was kidnapped on her way home from work, said another senior police officer on condition of anonymity. Three militants armed with Chinese-made AK-47 rifles stopped a van in which <PERSON> Rubaiya </PERSON> was traveling with 10 other people, and escaped with her in a car. Later, in a telephone call to <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION> residence, members of the group demanded freedom for the five jailed militants, police said. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, a man who answered the telephone at <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>'s home said they had learned <PERSON> Rubaiya </PERSON> was unharmed. `` It is too early to say what the government will do,'' he said. The man did not give his name. <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON> is <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s first Moslem home minister. His appointment by <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a Hindu, was seen as an effort to help resolve tensions between Hindus and Moslems. Moslems form 11 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people, and Hindus make up 80 percent. <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> is the only Indian state with a Moslem majority. Militants have been agitating for secession from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, claiming that <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> ought to be an independent nation or part of Moslem <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> is claimed by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and the two countries have fought three wars over the territory since they gained independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state was formed from two kingdoms. <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION> was predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION>, while <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> was mostly Moslem. Today, 64 percent of the combined <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state are Moslems.

<TEXT>
 Rebellious inmates surrendered to authorities today at two of four prisons where riots occurred after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> refused to extend a nationwide amnesty to hard-core criminals. At leave five prisoners have died during the uprisings. About 1,500 prisoners at the Czarne Prison on the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and 1,000 inmates at Goleniow Prison in northwest <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> gave up after police and prison guards prepared assaults at the facilities, the state <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news service said. On Friday, the government authorized the use of force to end the disturbances which began at the prisons Thursday, the agency said. Four inmates were reported killed in the worst uprising, at <LOCATION> Czarne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>, near the city of <LOCATION> Slupsk </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said the stabbed and beaten victims had been lynched by fellow prisoners during the riots. Authorities who re-entered Goleniow Prison, near the city of <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>, also found the charred body of a prisoner in one of the two pavilions of the prison that were set on fire by inmates, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. Fire also destroyed the prison hospital and library. Besides <PERSON> Czarne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Goleniow </PERSON>, about 1,000 inmates rioted at <LOCATION> Kaminsk </LOCATION> in north-central <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and 850 inmates rioted at <LOCATION> Nowogard </LOCATION>, also near <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>, TV said. The four prisons are for hard-core, or habitual, criminals. The uprisings at <LOCATION> Kaminsk </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Nowogard </PERSON> continued today. The revolts began after the Sejm, or lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, turned down a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal to extend the new Solidarity-led government's far-reaching amnesty program to habitual criminals. At <LOCATION> Czarne </LOCATION>, prisoners learned of the decision on the TV news and immediately `` started destroying equipment, set warehouse facilities on fire and attacked prison guards who tried to get the situation under control,'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. On Friday, state television broadcast scenes of inmates wrapped in blankets gathered on the fire-damaged prison roof, with flames visible through the windows of the brick building. `` Why are we doing it? Because we do n't agree with the verdicts that were handed out in the 1980s,'' one prisoner with bandages over his eyes told a TV interviewer. The amnesty was proposed by the Solidarity members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to give prisoners a second chance under <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new non-Communist-led government. `` We can not allow prisoners to take the law into their own hands. The decision on the amnesty is final,'' Justice Minister <PERSON> Aleksander </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentkowski </PERSON> said on the national TV news Friday. He noted that the amnesty was an `` act of mercy'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> that will benefit 17,000 inmates nationwide but that the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> concluded it could not include prisoners who have four or more convictions. The Polish <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had urged broadening the amnesty so that it would no longer exclude multiple offenders, committers of major thefts and those convicted of vehicular manslaughter under influence of alcohol. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal aroused widespread debate among Poles who feared it would lead to a wholesale release of criminals at a time when crime rates are already increasing.

 Four people drowned in flash floods after fierce rainstorms swept northern villages, police reported Saturday. The bodies of three victims, all from the same family, were found in a car that was washed away in the Jaila valley at <LOCATION> Sumail </LOCATION>, 56 miles southwest of the capital, <LOCATION> Muscat </LOCATION>. In a separate incident at <LOCATION> Rostaq </LOCATION>, 100 miles west of <LOCATION> Muscat </LOCATION>, a 7-year-old girl died in another flooded valley. Witnesses said her family could not save her as she was swept away. Rain has been heavy over the past days in several parts of the Arabian peninsula. On Wednesday, about three-quarters of an inch of rain fell in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. Meteorologists said that was the wettest day there since Dec. 26, 1974, when more than an inch of rain fell.

 A cargo ship hit an oil platform in the southern <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Suez </LOCATION>, causing millions of dollars in damage to the rig but no casualties, a senior oil company official said Saturday. He said the collision spilled natural gas and a small amount of oil from the platform into the Gulf of <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION>. The platform is owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> GUPCO </ORGANIZATION>, a joint Egyptian-American venture with major operations in the gulf between mainland <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION>. The official, who demanded anonymity, identified the ship as the Philippine-registered <LOCATION> Panay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sampaguita </LOCATION>, bound for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> with a load of iron and timber. Police in <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> impounded the 27,652-ton carrier just outside the city harbor on orders of government prosecutors who began an investigation. The GUPCO official said the accident occurred shortly before 4 a.m. Friday in the <LOCATION> Ras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shukeir </LOCATION> area, about 140 miles south of <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION>. `` The weather at the time was good, and the ship obviously was traveling outside the navigation channel,'' he said. He said he expected damage to exceed $ 10 million on the platform, which produces about 6,000 barrels of crude oil daily. A ship hit the same platform in 1987, and repairs cost $ 1 million, he said.

<TEXT>
 People are happily using words like `` freedom'' and `` democracy'' these days, but their joy is tempered by worry about the future. The rush to undo 40 years of repression is a plunge into the unknown by a politically divided people not given to recklessness. On the streets, thundering crowds appear to have smashed the elaborate apparatus that had left them powerless to criticize the state beyond a guarded whisper or swift slash of wit. Up close and alone, however, Czechoslovaks, like East Germans, Poles and Hungarians, still face the painful process of learning to shape the politics that govern them. A lightning revolution fired spirits. But decades of dashed hopes and broken promises have left their mark. `` We are confused,'' said <PERSON> Jitka </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyvltova </PERSON>, a young artisan. `` We are speaking with emotion, saying what is in our hearts. This is very dangerous. We must act with great calm.'' She fears the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will exploit divisions among the opposition, retaining its control and perhaps exacting revenge on the more daring. She knows the old apparatus is protected not only by a privileged class but also by workers, farmers and pensioners who have made peace with the devil they know. Communism's monopoly was excised from the constitution. Non-communist ministers entered the government. But elections, though promised, are not yet scheduled. Nor have they been won. Even in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, but especially in smaller towns and farm villages, many are still testing the wind. Few expect Communists to dominate free elections. But there are all those shades of gray. In <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, a children's book writer chatted about freedom, relishing on his tongue the feel of terms like `` Communist thugs.'' Suddenly, he stopped and frowned. `` Read back to me anything you quote me on,'' he told the American reporter taking notes. `` The secret police, you know.'' Specialists see critical and deep-seated obstacles to defining freedom and restoring democracy. `` This is a morally sick society, and it will take longer to cure than it will to reform the economy,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Borecky </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> psychiatrist. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s death rate from stress was alarming among men in their 40s, he said. `` It is not comparable to stress in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> where you win or lose. Here, you do n't exist.'' Before, people only spoke out among friends, but they were sure of a job and, most likely, a car and vacation cottage. No one worried about the next meal. Hard work was optional and seldom rewarding. Now, in the heat of their first political campaign in half a century, Czechoslovaks must find a way to fit Western freedoms in with socialism's traditional freedoms from choice. Some Czechoslovaks think liberty will prove to be a miracle drug. `` Our young people were supposed to be so dispirited, rotten, but look at them,'' said historian <PERSON> Desider </PERSON> <PERSON> Galsky </PERSON>, 68. `` Their elders are so proud of them, it is touching.'' The revolution's rejection of violence, like revulsion to the police brutality that triggered it, formed a basis for a new social model, he said. `` They did it without breaking a window or smashing a car,'' he said. `` Never in history was there such a revolution, so elegant, so sophisticated. It was so Czech.'' But <PERSON> Galsky </PERSON> agreed that hard times lie ahead, and no one knows the extent of the bill to be paid. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> can not alter its course without inflation, layoffs and chaotic disruptions, economists say. Sacrifices can be demanded only by a strong, popular consensus government. And consensus will not be easy. Under Marxism, everything but politics was political. People took no part in government, but daily life required alliances, compromises and ward-heeling. Czechoslovak politics are minimalist. At <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, for example, three youths in gas masks burst from the metro and swept the street with exaggerated motions. They were ecologists pushing one of the countless parties forming weekly. Even immediate victories mean glitches in the system. For example, an end to censorship gave Czechoslovaks new access to generations of literature. But only so many manuscripts at a time can be edited, printed and distributed. So much banned work is backed up, for example, that writers eager to say something new, and their editors, may have to wait years for the logjam to clear. `` At least 500,000 books are waiting in warehouses, and the government has promised to put them in shops,'' said <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavlat </PERSON>, a publishing house editor. `` This is a tough time to be a new writer.'' But, jokes <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehak </PERSON>, there are new opportunities. A student who climbs mountains, he was enlisted to scramble up rooftops to remove Communist red stars and outmoded banners. <PERSON> Rehak </PERSON> admits to fear, but he is grateful for what has been won so far. For one thing, he said, good jobs and privileges are no longer the preserve of the party faithful. `` We will have to distinguish people who are creeps, and now we have the right and power to remove those creeps,'' he said. Optimists say the rush of events is only a taste of what will come. They are counting on the Czechoslovak industriousness, flexibility and flair that made this nation of 15 million a prosperous democracy between world wars. At the very least, long submission did not dim Czechoslovak wit and peoples' ability to jab fun at themselves. On its latest cover, the satirical weekly Dikobraz -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Porcupine </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- remarked on the job revolutionaries face in translating freedom and democracy for Czechoslovak tongues. It showed an average-guy character flinging open his Superman cape to uncover the word: `` Forward!'' A close look reveals he is a tree trunk, with a mass of roots snaking deep into the ground.

<TEXT>
 Political jealousy, military factionalism and President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s failure to deliver on promises of her `` people power revolution'' account for the cycle of coup attempts that has rocked this nation. About 400 rebels surrendered Saturday in <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION>, ending the sixth and bloodiest attempt to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. The political and economic damage has been devastating. The violence shattered the illusion of stability, carefully crafted by Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s advisers. It also exposed the disarray in a government that all too often blames its own shortcomings on the legacy of former President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. `` She's been hurt, there's no question about it,'' a senior <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration official told reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s ability to survive depends on how well she learns from the coup attempt. It is far from certain any lessons will be learned. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> reorganized her Cabinet after coup attempts in November 1986 and August 1987 and promised `` a new beginning,'' which proved largely rhetorical. `` This coup happened because of her administration's wishy-washy approach to national problems,'' columnist <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Chanco </PERSON> wrote in the newspaper <LOCATION> Malaya </LOCATION>. `` My fear with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s tough posture -LRB- during the coup attempt -RRB- is the likelihood that she will forget all about it when the crisis is over.'' Despite talk of national reconciliation, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has never mastered the art of dealing with political rivals, essential to building a consensus in this fragmented society. Behind the public image of the frail, vulnerable widow stands an iron-willed woman, whom associates describe as stubborn to a fault. She tends to dismiss criticism as the carping of jealous rivals. But Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> faces a military deeply politicized after years of martial law, which <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> imposed from 1972 until 1981. Each coup attempt has enhanced the influence of the military at the expense of civilian authority. Although Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> ruled out negotiations with the rebels, military commanders opened talks and persuaded most of them to surrender. Military Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> told Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> of the talks after they began. Mutineers will be tried by military courts, which have been reluctant to impose harsh sentences after previous coup attempts. Ironically, the `` people power revolution'' itself encouraged the notion that the military should play a role in politics. The revolt began in February 1986 as a coup attempt against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, organized by some of the same officers who have since tried to overthrow Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. It succeeded after Cardinal <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sin </PERSON> and secular groups sent hundreds of thousands of followers into the streets to `` protect'' the mutineers from <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' troops. Young officers of the Reform the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> RAM </ORGANIZATION>, who led the 1986 uprising, assumed they would share power with the president they helped put in office. Instead, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> filled her Cabinet with many longtime supporters bitter at the military for martial law. She also made peace overtures to Communist and Moslem rebels while others in her government threatened to prosecute soldiers for human rights abuses under <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. That deepened suspicion and resentment in the ranks and prompted the reform movement to begin plotting. The movement, organized in 1985 to fight corruption in the ranks, is believed to have led at least three coup attempts, including the latest. Its members include Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, leader of the August 1987 coup attempt. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> is believed to have played a key role in the recent attempt. Apart from political jealousy, movement members were motivated by a belief that their goals were not realized. Corruption persists in both the military and civilian government. Although most Filipinos remain suspicious of a military government, a growing number are dissatisfied with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> because of rising prices, decaying infrastructure and a lack of decisive leadership. In 1986, many Filipinos assumed Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> would introduce sweeping social, political and economic reforms to transform the nation's feudalistic society. Instead, she simply restored traditional democratic institutions, including a bicameral <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and left the job of reform to them. A bicameral legislature, patterned after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> system, has proven unwieldy here and incapable of speeding controversial legislation. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has ruled out a second term in 1992. As a `` lame duck,'' she finds it difficult to bring to heel errant legislators whose terms run concurrently with her own. Since parties are weak and based on temporary personal alliances, congressional leaders also have trouble delivering the vote on controversial legislation. Leaders of the recent coup attempt called for a civilian-military junta to initiate reforms and organize a referendum to decide what form of government to establish. Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, fired as defense minister after the November 1986 coup attempt, believes a unicameral, parliamentary system _ with a figurehead president and prime minister _ would be better. `` It provides a safety valve that will release political steam and enable the people to make a vote of no confidence, to dislodge the government without resorting to arms,'' <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said. `` This is the way to end all these recurring coups.'' The latest attempt occurred as millions were facing growing economic hardships due to rising prices, electricity shortages, a decline in the peso and transportation problems. For months, many supporters were warning Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> that discontent was mounting. Intead of taking action, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> asked for patience and blamed the problem on <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. She went to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in August and to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last month, seeking investments. She took her 18-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Kris </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to shop for Christmas presents. `` In all humility, I can whisper now, ` perhaps I told you so,''' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alcuaz </PERSON>, fired as telecommunications chief after publicly warning a coup was imminent. `` The ` fed-up factor' has reached alarming proportions.''

<TEXT>
 Central American presidents reconvene on Sunday in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> in an attempt to reverse what has been a steady deterioration of the peace process they began three years ago. The two-day summit will be attended by the presidents of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, for whom almost nothing has gone right since they met in August in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The peace process `` urgently needs to be put back on track,'' as one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official put it last week. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government is bitterly disappointed that the Dec. 5 deadline for demobilizing the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels _ agreed to last August _ has passed with the insurgents still intact and still receiving non-lethal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance. Coupled with that was <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s decision six weeks ago to suspend a cease-fire with the Contras that had been in effect for 19 months. Negotiations to restore the cease-fire broke down last month. There have been setbacks to the peace process on the Salvadoran front as well. The crash last month of a plane from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> carrying surface-to-air missiles to the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> led it to suspend relations with <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The murder earlier in November of six Jesuit priests, presumably by rightist death squads, underscored how far <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> is from national reconciliation. The massacre occurred just five days after the start of the most sustained rebel offensive since the conflict began 10 years ago. The <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> issue was one of the main points of contention at last week's summit meeting between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants the Soviets to do more to prevent cross-border deliveries of weaponry of Soviet bloc equipment to the Salvadoran rebels. Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said last week that he will ask his Central American colleagues to set Dec. 31 as the new deadline for demobilizing the Contras. He said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> will not agree to a deadline beyond that date but has not said what he will do if the Contras are still in existence afterward. The rebels, backed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, want to stay together until after national elections set for Feb. 25. If the elections are free and fair, the Contras say that is the best guarantee that their return to their homeland will be safe. Mistrust between the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration continues to run high. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are worried that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> may be laying the groundwork either to call off the elections or to steal them. Nicaraguan authorities, meanwhile, have promised a free and fair process and say the elections will go ahead war or no war.

 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION> said today that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> should set aside differences over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s crackdown on the pro-democracy movement and strengthen their relationship. Scowcroft's visit ended a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ban on high-level meetings with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He and Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> arrived earlier in the day as special envoys to brief Chinese leaders on the U.S.-Soviet summit in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. `` We believe it is important that we not exhaust ourselves in placing blame for problems that exist,'' Scowcroft said at a dinner held by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said he had come `` to bring new impetus and vigor into our bilateral relationship and seek new areas of agreement. ... We come to reduce the negative influence of irritants in the relationship.'' The Chinese, who have blamed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for current friction, showed their desire to improve ties by arranging meetings with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top leaders Sunday. Scowcroft and <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> are to meet with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON> and senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> before leaving in the afternoon for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. They are to return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 85, retired from his last party post in November. He also has cut down his public apppearances, and his meeting with the Americans is a clear sign that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> hopes to end the feuding. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON>, in his banquet toast, said the special envoys' visit shows the importance President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attaches to U.S.-Chinese relations, `` for which we would like to express our appreciation.'' `` Important as our differences are,'' <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said, `` they can not obliterate the major common interests between us.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in a statement that while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` deplores the tragedy of Tiananmen Square last June, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> nevertheless remains part of the world around us. The president views <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as an important country in world affairs.'' Relations between <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hit a low after the Chinese crushed the student-led, pro-democracy movement. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> criticized the violence and repression, and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of interfering in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. The Chinese government says 300 people, mostly soldiers, died during the violent suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on June 3-4. Witnesses and Western sources say hundreds or even thousands died, most of the victims unarmed civilians. In the past three weeks, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has lodged three official protests with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over congressional actions to expand economic sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and to allow <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students to extend their stays in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But Chinese leaders, in recent meetings with former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, also have expressed hope that relations could be improved. There was speculation in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> that the two sides may discuss how to resolve the situation of astrophysicist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, the pro-democracy dissident who has been hiding in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy with his wife, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, since the crackdown. The Chinese have branded the couple counterrevolutionaries and issued warrants for their arrest. An embassy official declined comment on whether the Americans discussed <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> in their talks with Qian today.

<HEAD>Group Examines Soviet Disinformation Despite Advances</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Old habits die hard in the intelligence community, where a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government task force says it still has its hands full countering Soviet disinformation linking the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to baby-buying, AIDS and assassinations. Neither the slow thaw in the cold war nor last year's superpower decision to set up a U.S.-Soviet panel `` for clarifying and correcting alleged errors in information disseminated by the other side'' has stopped the Active Measures Working Group from meeting every two weeks and gathering material for its annual report. The Soviets say the reports `` do not provide the spirit of friendly relations.'' Further, they say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is equally at fault for spreading disinformation, although they offer few examples. The Active Measures Working Group is chaired by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and has representatives from <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Justice departments. The term `` active measures'' is a literal translation from the Russian and means covert or deceptive operations. The group's annual report was ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. This year's slick-covered, 64-page issue was presented to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in October and says its purpose `` is to reveal and describe Soviet influence activities that are deceptive and illegitimate.'' The report covers news reports, forgeries and anti-American propaganda that appeared worldwide from June 1987 to November 1988. It says: `` Soviet active measures campaigns are integrated operations, carried out with the approval of the Politburo or Central Committee Secretariat.'' Reports starting in 1987 said that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children were being bought up and taken to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be sacrificed for their organs. Such stories circulated worldwide, showing up in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> responds by sending <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies statements to deny the allegations as they appear. `` There was a rash of it only a few weeks ago,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, who followed department guidelines by speaking only on condition he not be identified. `` Once these things get going they are very hard to stop.'' He displayed recent clippings from Soviet writers about other issues. One, an interview with a state-run Novosti writer, quoted a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> doctor as saying the AIDS virus began in 1952 when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> set off a nuclear bomb on Bikini atoll. Last year the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed to deal with disinformation issues directly. The latest Active Measures report, mentioning the joint U.S.-Soviet group, says: `` Despite this apparent breakthrough, active measures have continued.'' <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulay </PERSON>, press counselor for the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, objects. `` There is no intentional policy on the part of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to distort facts which concern the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bulay </PERSON> said. `` It was never a policy,'' he added, saying some of the reports could have been the work of journalists angry at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for being `` labeled as coming from the ` evil empire.''' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said the anti-American propaganda has been reduced in the era of glasnost, but it has not been eliminated. `` The practices of decades are apparently difficult to forsake,'' the official said. As a sign of better times, he noted: `` We do n't see broadcasts to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> deliberately telling people about the poor little children who are being fattened up for their organs.'' The Active Measures report says meetings of the joint U.S.-Soviet group on disinformation were held this year in January and April `` with results described as encouraging.'' Bulay, at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said the joint group was designed to deal with these issues and he suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> cease its annual reports. `` There are a number of cases we are raising to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said, saying one of them was the portrayal of the Soviet army during <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military maneuvers earlier this year. `` I'm not mentioning specific cases because we had semi-confidential talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Soviet diplomat said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> group is `` self-serving.'' `` It certainly could be reciprocated,'' he said. `` There's enough material for such a report But there's a feeling it wo n't promote better relations.

<TEXT>
 The new Communist premier today opened talks aimed at putting the final touches to a coalition government in which Communists are likely to be in the minority for the first time in 41 years. Hard-line Communist President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> planned to speak on national television tonight in an address expected to deal with opposition demands that he resign by Sunday. And tens of thousands of Czechoslovaks streamed into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> to shop or sightsee today, their first non-working day since their government lifted restrictions on free travel to the West. Premier <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON>, on the job for only his third day, received the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> at his offices and planned to meet representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the opposition and other smaller political groups, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said. Calfa on Friday said on national state TV that `` roughly one-half of the new government could be composed of experts with no political affiliation.'' <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON> assumed his position after premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> resigned Thursday. The other half of the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> seats would go to the Communists and members of the four other political parties permitted in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, according to government spokesman <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON>. A woman at the government press office, who refused to identify herself on the telephone, said it was expected the makeup of the new Cabinet would be made public by Sunday afternoon. <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON>'s announcement was a huge concession to opposition leaders who have set a Sunday deadline for the leadership to name a new government that satisfies their demands for democratic reforms. They have staged mass demonstrations and threatened to call a general strike Monday. Communists relinquished their majority on Friday in the regional government in <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION>, one of the two republics that comprise the nation. <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION>'s Communist premier, <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrivnak </PERSON>, and his entire Cabinet were ousted, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said. Former Justice Minister <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cic </PERSON> was asked to form a new Cabinet. Under an agreement with the opposition, independents would have nine seats in the 17-member regional <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. The rest of the government would include six Communists and one representative each from two smaller, legal parties. The move follows a similiar agreement Wednesday in the <LOCATION> Czech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, which made Communists a minority in that regional government although they retained the leadership and key ministerial posts. The composition of both regional governments are precursors to what is expected to be approval of new national government that makes the Communists a minority for the first time since they took over complete rule in 1948. A statement issued early today by the main opposition group, Civic Forum, said Friday's talks brought together `` representatives of all the decisive political forces'' and that they parted `` united in the hope'' they could help <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON> form a government to be sworn in Sunday. `` This should be a government of national understanding,'' the statement said. The changes come as equally sweeping developments in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where the Communists today named opposition lawyer <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> as party leader. Officials and opposition leaders in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> held two sets of talks on Friday. Afterward, a visibly pleased <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, a top opposition leader, said `` the results will be public soon'' but declined to divulge details. <PERSON> Vasil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON>, a member of the ruling Politburo, told reporters a coalition government `` representing all parts'' of the political spectrum would be named by Sunday. He did not elaborate, adding only that there would be fewer Communists. Another dissident at the talks, Slovak activist <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON>, said `` certain gains have been won and it has been agreed that all the political interests will be represented.'' He said it was possible that he would become a deputy prime minister. <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> took the highly unusual step of interviewing <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON> and fellow Slovak activist <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusy </PERSON>, another government candidate, on Friday night. <PERSON> Carnogurksy </PERSON> said he thinks free elections could be held in March. <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>'s fate was expected to be decided before Sunday. <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, 76, one of the last remaining members of the old guard leadership, supported the Soviet-led invasion that crushed the `` Prague Spring'' reforms enacted by Communist liberals in 1968. <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> should remain in office to swear in the new government, `` otherwise we would have a constitutional crisis.'' In the past three weeks, mass pro-democracy demonstrations headed up by the Civic Forum opposition and its Slovak counterpart, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violence </ORGANIZATION>, have forced the Communists to relinquish their 41-year monopoly on political power. But a government named last Sunday by <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> included only five non-Communists in a 21-member Cabinet, and left Communists in control of all key ministries. Initially, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> scheduled to announce the new government on Friday. But his resignation on Thursday, and growing demands for genuine power-sharing, forced a new talks.

 A surgeon who performed the nation's second liver transplant from a living donor, taking part of a father's liver and implanting it in his 15-month-old daughter, said the operation proved `` very difficult.'' The daughter, <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON>, underwent 7 -LCB- hours of surgery at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, leaving the operating room just after 10:30 p.m., hospital spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> said. She and her father, 20-year-old <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, were listed in critical but stable condition today in the intensive care unit as is customary in such cases, <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> said. `` It was a very difficult operation, but I expect her to be fairly stable afterward,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> Broelsch </PERSON>, the transplant surgeon. This morning, doctors described the girl's progress so far as `` outstanding,'' said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fetsch </PERSON>. And <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> could be moved out of intensive care by the end of the day, she said. In the operation, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a dry-wall installer and contractor from <LOCATION> Millington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, had the left lobe of his liver removed and the partial organ implanted into <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON>. <PERSON> Broelsch </PERSON> said that during the operation he spotted lingering signs of a bacterial infection that she came down with two weeks ago, which had postponed the operation. `` They were able to clear out the remnants of the infection,'' <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> is -RRB- awake and talking to his wife. He's uncomfortable as you might expect, but he is wide awake and doing very well,'' <PERSON> Broelsch </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitington </PERSON>, director of pediatric transplant services at the hospital, said the operation was not expected to be the most difficult hurdle for <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON> to overcome. `` Her difficulty is going to be recovery, convalescing, regaining nutritional status, overcoming any infections,'' he said. <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON>'s mother, 21-year-old <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, said the roughest part of the ordeal had been the waiting, but the family had no reservations about the surgery. `` I'm excited that it's finally come true,'' she said at an afternoon news conference. `` We've been waiting for a long time, and it's finally here.'' <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON> has suffered since birth from a usually fatal disorder called biliary atresia. The congenital disorder also afflicted 21-month-old <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who last week received part of her mother's liver at the hospital in the first living-donor liver transplant in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Schertz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, was doing well Friday, with her liver function `` rapidly improving toward normal'' and no signs of her body rejecting the transplant, <PERSON> Whitington </PERSON> said. Her mother, <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a 29-year-old schoolteacher, was released from the hospital Thursday. <PERSON> Whitington </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON> was not nearly as strong as <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> going into her transplant, but `` we thought it was her best chance for survival and the best graft available under the circumstances.'' A team led by <PERSON> Broelsch </PERSON> began removing part of the liver of <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON>'s father at about 7.30 a.m. and began surgery on <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON> at 3 p.m. <PERSON> Whitington </PERSON> said the father's only misgiving about the operation was a fear that `` his daughter might die before he woke up from the surgery.''

<HEAD>Candidates Switching Sides on Abortion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In dazzling leaps or small steps, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic candidates are moving away from anti-abortion positions as they prepare for 1990 campaigns that promise to spotlight the divisive issue. `` They're changing so fast it's hard to keep up with them all,'' says <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. Her abortion-rights lobby has been swamped with news of converts in the weeks since anti-abortion candidates were defeated in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> governors races, and as an impression grows that electoral majorities favor maintaining legal abortions. The most startling reversal came last week by <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON>, the leading contender for the Democratic nomination for governor. After more than a decade as an outspoken opponent of abortion, <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> declared that if elected he would veto any legislation banning abortion and would support public funding of the procedure for poor women. His move was regarded as an attempt to head off the potential Democratic candidacy of an abortion-rights supporter, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> stunned and infuriated national anti-abortion leaders, who distributed copies of a statement he signed three years ago pledging support for legislation to prohibit abortion except to prevent the death of the mother, and to oppose the use of tax money for abortions. `` A total flip-flop for what he perceives as personal political gain,'' said an outraged <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Steen </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON>, however, is only the latest and most clear-cut example of 1990 candidates trying to stake out the most advantageous position for their respective races. Democratic gubernatorial candidates Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Belotti </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> have all taken steps or made comments that have been seen as moderating past opposition to abortion or siding outright with abortion-rights forces. Sharp divisions among Republican have emerged. Two <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates for governor of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Luce </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Rains </PERSON>, have begun airing television commercials declaring their support for legal abortions. They have drawn battle lines against anti-abortion primary candidates including former Rep. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hance </PERSON>. In Rains' case, the move came just a few weeks after he appeared at a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> fund-raiser for a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> anti-abortion group and said, `` I stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this cause.'' Driving the political turnabouts is the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling last summer that gave states more leeway to regulate abortions. That thrust the issue back in the hands of state politicians. `` It's going to be a very major factor in gubernatorial races,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, publisher of the American Political Report. `` It's a defining issue,'' said <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, director of programs for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's like civil rights was, in some ways like the Vietnam War was. It tells you who a person is, and what he or she believes.'' In <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races, the re-election battle of Democrat <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, an abortion-rights supporter, against Republican Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, an abortion opponent, is already one of the most closely watched 1990 contests. While Democrats were the beneficiaries of the new political focus on abortion in 1989 races, the party has a number of incumbents on the other side of the issue. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> is an opponent of abortion and could face a Republican who supports abortion rights. Republican <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafer </PERSON>, the state auditor, has the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> GOP's endorsement. Another key race is in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where Republican Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> made abortion the issue when he called a special legislative session to enact abortion restrictions. He failed to win passage of his proposals, and he now faces a Republican primary against a state senator, <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodson-Howard </PERSON>, who supports abortion rights. Bracing for a tough battle and on <ORGANIZATION> NARAL </ORGANIZATION>'s national hit list, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> has amassed a $ 4 million campaign war chest. In the Democratic race to oppose <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, a state senator, are both running as supporters of abortion rights. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> in the past has opposed abortion, however, and the national abortion-rights lobby remains skeptical of him. He was among some two-dozen <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who switched positions last October _ from a similar vote a year earlier _ to support liberalized federal funding of abortions for poor women. `` He says he's been pro-choice, when he has not been,'' <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON> said. Until <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON>'s switch, <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' attorney general <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> had been the primary object of anti-abortion leaders' wrath. He is running for governor against Republican <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON>, the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, who supports abortion rights. <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> had been counted as opposing abortion, until he agreed to an out-of-court settlement last month of a key court case that was pending before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The case had been viewed by both sides as a potential vehicle for a majority on the court to reverse its 16-year-old <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision upholding the right to an abortion. `` He obviously betrayed the pro-life people who had supported him,'' said <PERSON> Darla </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, associate executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Another key race is for governor of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, a state long considered conservative on the abortion issue, and where the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race already assures a focus on abortion. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the state attorney general, has been running as an anti-abortion candidate and leads a field of opponents who support abortion-rights. But in recent weeks he has said he would not seek any restrictions on abortion, except to support a law requiring notification of the parent of a minor seeking an abortion. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is still counted as an abortion opponent. <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON> said his actions are `` little signals'' that he may be changing. `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is feeling the heat,'' she said. The winner of the primary will face Republican Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>, who is an abortion opponent. Other battles over abortion are shaping up, including potential gubernatorial primaries in both parties in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, in <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primaries for governor in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, and in the Republican <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primary in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Nuclear Weapons Plant Found Unprepared for Radioactive Emergencies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pantex </ORGANIZATION>, the country's only final assembly plant for nuclear bombs and missile warheads, could not respond effectively to emergency releases of radioactive material, according to experts who inspected the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> weapons factory. Appointed by Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, a `` tiger team'' of government and outside experts found significant health, safety and environmental deficiencies at the World War II-era plant outside <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>. In a memo accompanying the team's draft report, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the findings indicate workers lack adequate protection from emergency and routine exposures to radioactive releases. He said the situation must be corrected immediately. While the team said it found no conditions that appeared `` to pose a clear and present danger to safety and health ... it was clear the radiation safety department would be unable to respond effectively to emergencies involving a release of radioactive material.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pantex </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said some problems already had been corrected and others were being addressed by plant officials. In its report released Wednesday, the team said the radiation protection program was generally inadequate `` as evidenced by extensive non-compliance'' with <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> regulations. The plant's contractor, and <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, have been aware of the situation for several years `` but little has been achieved to correct it,'' the report said. Although <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the plant has a strong `` safety culture ... little evidence exists that a comparable environmental culture is evolving. This must be corrected.'' The report said <ORGANIZATION> Pantex </ORGANIZATION> is not adequately monitoring its impact on the underlying <LOCATION> Ogallala </LOCATION> aquifer, practically the only source of useable water for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' largest irrigated farming region. As of August, 11 of the plant's 29 underground storage tank systems had been leak-tested and five were either leaking or had leaking pipes. Those systems have been replaced and testing continues on the remaining systems. `` If the failure rate continues to be as high as in the first 11 tank systems tested, there could be substantive on-going releases to the subsurface environment,'' the report said. The plant's procedures for assessing possible contamination of the air, soil and ground water also do not meet industry standards and the plant does not have an environmental monitoring plan, said the team, which was at <ORGANIZATION> Pantex </ORGANIZATION> from Oct. 2-31. <ORGANIZATION> Pantex </ORGANIZATION> also has failed to ask the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> whether it needs a permit for discharges of contaminated and potentially contaminated waste water runoff into several playas _ ephemeral desert lakes _ on the grounds of the 16,000-acre plant. Samples collected in ditches leading to three of those playas and in two playas show heavy metal and organic contamination in water and sediments, the report said. <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> investigators sent to the plant found more than 300 violations, dozens of them serious. In one health violation, records were not maintained on an employee's exposure to radioactive material during a weapon teardown operation, or for employees involved in the cleanup. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has ordered DOE officials and the plant's contractor, <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hanger-Silas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, to address all deficiencies in a final plan due in February. A formal <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> report is expected by mid-January. The plant assembles, maintains and repairs nuclear weapons and manufactures high explosive components.

 The new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> voice that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been hearing for six months is getting away _ so far _ with saying things the Japanese do n't want to be told. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> hit <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> running when he arrived in May and has n't cut back on an energetic schedule of speeches and meetings, in which he offers what he calls `` friendly advice'' to officials, the media and business leaders. His advice, delivered in a voice unexpectedly soft coming from a 6-foot-4-inch man, is couched in careful reason but amounts to a call for the Japanese to change: change what they say, what they write in their newspapers, the way they do business, their barriers to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports and investment. His speeches make news and sometimes invite comparison with his predecessor, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>, 86, who retired after 11 years as ambassador. Slowed by illness that required heart surgery in early 1988, <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> was far less active in his last years in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> than <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, 34 years his junior, has been. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> dislikes comparing his performance with <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>'s. `` I have great admiration for him and thought he was a tremendous ambassador,'' he said in an interview in his ninth-floor embassy office. `` He clearly has helped me because he lent such stature to the job. So anybody who followed him was bound to be taken more seriously, at least for a while, because he raised the whole level of the job.'' <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> sometimes was criticized for not stressing trade issues enough, while <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> on arrival declared he was going to be the embassy's top commercial officer. One of his main goals is reduction of the $ 50 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> annual trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` It's not a matter so much of personal interest of the ambassador, but a matter of the times,'' <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> said. `` I came into the job at a time when people back home were experiencing intense frustration because of the fact that four years of major adjustments on macro-economic policy had not produced the result that was expected in our bilateral trade.'' So he calls on the Japanese to make even more changes, to the delight of local Americans and even many Japanese who admired <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> for his relentless insistence that the U.S.-Japan relationship was the most important bilateral tie <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has. <PERSON> Tadashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> did a good job. `` But <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> is younger, he's active and can touch more bases.'' <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> praised the career diplomat for including the widows of past Japanese ambassadors to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in a recent farewell party for the new Japanese ambassador. The widows were touched by the gesture, <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> `` can say things which Japanese do n't necessarily want to hear. But also he appears to be very reasonable in many things he says,'' <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> often says that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> both will win by resolving their trade problem. `` Trade is not a zero-sum game,'' he says, using a term perhaps borrowed from his years of teaching government before he went into the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. A native of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> taught at <ORGANIZATION> Pomona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, at <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. In the early 1970s, he was special assistant to <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reischauer </PERSON>, then the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> was ambassador to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> from 1982 to 1984, and then was undersecretary of state for political affairs before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> named him to replace <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>. He says he has been dealing with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for 21 years, and when he declares that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are becoming increasingly interdependent, he speaks from a family viewpoint as well as an official one. One of his three sons is married to a Japanese and another attended a university here. `` Let me ... offer some friendly advice,'' <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> said in a recent speech to a business conference on Japanese investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, shortly after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern accelerated with <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. If Japanese investors want to keep a receptive atmosphere in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> said, they must promote American managers, hire women and minorities, follow U.S.-style corporate philanthropy and use local suppliers. Most important, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> must open itself to foreign investment, he said. In almost every area, he said, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s performance is lagging. And to Japanese commentators who find racism behind Americans' wariness about Japanese investment, he said, `` That view is misinformed and, I believe, dangerous, because it deflects attention from the real sources of concern. He has chided Japanese media _ and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> media as well _ about peppering their trade stories with emotive words like `` war'' and `` invasion,'' and he disputes a common Japanese complaint that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> lag because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies do n't try hard. `` It's not just a matter of not trying hard,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` Most companies I've run into are trying very hard and are doing it rather intelligently. `` But the fact remains that 20 to 25 percent of the banking industry in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is owned by the Japanese. I ca n't think of a single instance in which an American bank has been able to purchase a Japanese bank.'' He said, however, that trade friction `` is n't the whole sum and substance of the relationship. ... There's a lot in the relationship that's working well, and it's worth emphasizing from time to time because it tends to get taken for granted or forgotten.'' As examples, he cited <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s pledge of $ 150 million in aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, helping <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> deal with massive debts, growing foreign development aid, heavy financial support for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and cooperation with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on many regional problems.

<HEAD>Water Shortages Predicted in US, Other Countries in 1990s</HEAD>

 Chronic water shortages may appear during the 1990s from northern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to the western <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said a global report on irrigation released Saturday. The report _ `` Water for Agriculture: Facing the Limits'' _ said changes in world temperature almost inevitably will change the patterns of rain and water supply for several decades. That would make it harder for farmers to grow enough food for the world's rising population, said the author, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Postel </PERSON>, at a briefing Thursday on the report. <PERSON> Postel </PERSON> is vice-president of <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a study group supported by private foundations and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> agencies. `` Many areas could enter a period of chronic shortages during the nineties, including northern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, virtually all of northern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, pockets of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, much of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, and parts of the western <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' she wrote. `` Where scarcities loom, cities and farms are beginning to compete for available water; when water supplies tighten, farmers typically lose out,'' she wrote. She quoted one study as showing that global warming in the west could change the flow of melting snow from the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, taking 11 million acres of irrigation. Other reasons for shortages include over-pumping of water from supplies under the surface, poor management of reservoirs and _ most important _ the rapid growth of population the Third World, she said. Her expectation of changes due to global warming was challenged as speculative by <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosegrant </PERSON>, an irrigation expert at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. He suggested that her predictions may be too pessimstic. In an interview, he suggested that the right policy by governments, including higher prices for water, could improve water supplies. But he agreed with her that irrigation will not increase much in the 1990s. He had supplied figures to <PERSON> Postel </PERSON> showing that money lent to the Third World for irrigation dropped from $ 1.2 billion in 1975 to about $ 600 million in 1987. <PERSON> Postel </PERSON> cited <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, heavily dependent on aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and on water from the Nile, as a prime candidate for a disastrous water shortage that could reduce the already low living standards of its 55 million people. The Eqyptian population is increasing at the rate of 1 million every eight months, she added. She said a third of the world's food comes from irrigated land but that environmental damage as well as reduced spending had slowed the growth of irrigation. Poor management has brought an accumulation of salt that has damaged roughtly one acre in every four of irrigated land, she estimated. She pointed to the <LOCATION> Aral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, once the world's fourth biggest body of inland water, saying it had lost two-thirds of its water and tripled its level of salt, exterminating all the native fish. Recent photographs have shown abandoned fishing boats high on white salt beaches.

<BYLINE>Cuban Says Changes in East Europe Could Mean US Global Domination

 Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> says his country will not become an `` appendix of the Yankee empire'' even though the demise of communist rule in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> opens the way to global <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domination. Reaffirming his hard-line stance against changes on the other side of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> may be assigned the role of being among the last defenders of socialism. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> delivered the speech Thursday at a ceremony honoring more than 2,000 Cubans who have died carrying out revolutionary tasks overseas. A text was made available in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Reform of socialist countries is understandable, he said, but he expressed regret that the changes under way in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` have a capitalist direction.'' Capitalism, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said, implies `` prostitution, drugs, gambling, begging, unemployment, abysmal inequality between citizens'' and other ills. With the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other capitalist powers showing more interest in investing in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, `` what resources could the Third World _ where thousands of millions of people live under inhuman conditions _ expect from such a development of events?'' <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> asked. Comparing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said, `` In a world in which the Yankee empire was able to make a reality of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s dream of dominating the world, we would know how to defend this bastion until the last drop of blood.'' With the demise of like-minded governments in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and elsewhere in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is among just a handful of states adhering to orthodox communist rule. If capitalism returned to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> some day, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said, the country's independence and sovereignty would disappear forever. `` We would be an extension of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, a simple appendix of the Yankee empire,'' fulfilling the `` disgusting prophesy'' of 19th century <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders, he said. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said much of the wealth of the developed countries comes from unequal trade with the Third World, and now the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants East European countries to join in this `` colossal looting.'' `` If events follow their present course ... the bipolarized world we knew in the post-war era will inevitably become a unipolarized world under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hegemony,'' he said. There is even some sentiment in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said, for altering a trade pattern under which <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> receives above-market prices for its exports and a discount on some imports. He said he banned two Soviet publications this past summer for recommending that the Soviets sell to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> at higher prices and buy from it at lower ones. `` This is exactly the same thing that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does with Third World countries,'' he said, adding that these same countries face a discouraging future if existing trends are not reversed.

 East German lawyer and reform activist <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> took over Saturday as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader and promised to change its hard-line, bureaucratic image. `` We are no longer going to be just an administrative party,'' <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> said. `` We are going to be a party of conviction.'' <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>, 41, became the youngest leader of a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and said he had learned something from Western politics. He declined to make any `` pessimistic predictions'' about the Communists' chances in next year's planned free elections. `` We learned from Western politicians that you do n't do that,'' said <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>, who has the smooth, relaxed speaking style and ready smile of a Western politician. `` You always have to act very optimistic.'' <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> said the party would fight to win in next year's elections but also would be willing to work in coalition with other parties. `` We must naturally make ourselves so trustworthy that for the others we are seen as having the ability to work in coalition,'' he said. <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> won with support from 95.3 percent of the 2,714 voting delegates who took part in the balloting. He was the only candidate. His father, <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON>, now in his late 70s, served until last year as the state secretary for religious affairs in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` He's a very outspoken person, like his father, maybe that's why they replaced him as state secretary last year,'' said <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Runge </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Jewish Community <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>'s father is Jewish, and Ms. <PERSON> Runge </PERSON> said the new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader had been `` very supportive of the city's Jewish community.'' After completing high school <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> studied law at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Humboldt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> He graduated in 1970, then worked for a year as a legal assistant. In 1971, he began practicing as a defense lawyer dealing primarily in civil, labor and business cases. He has been chief of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> since 1988 and also served as the head of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 15 other attorney boards. Most recently, he represented the citizen's initiative New Forum when the opposition group was seeking official recognition in October. Authorities at the time declared New Forum illegal and called members `` enemies of the state.'' However, <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> insisted that rejection of New Forum's application to register as a legal organization violated East German statutes, and the group was officially recognized in November. Following the mass resignation of the Communists' ruling 10-man Politburo and 163-man <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week, <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> was named a member of a special committee to restructure the shattered party. <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> is an avid supporter of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s glasnost reform policies. He is divorced and the father of two children.

 Portable heaters and other supplemental appliances that are intended to make it cheaper to keep warm can be very dangerous if improperly used or installed, government experts say. The greatest danger is fire, the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> says. `` Supplemental home heating appliances are estimated to be associated with 105,800 residential fires, killing an estimated 600 people in 1987,'' the commission said in a recent statement. Comparatively, cooking equipment _ gas and electric stoves and other items _ accounted for 102,900 home fires and 330 deaths, according to <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the commission. Additionally, thousands of injuries from contact burns and about 100 deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning from home heating appliance emissions occur annually, the commission said. Kerosene, gas and electric heaters accounted for more than half the residential fire deaths due to home heating appliances in 1987. Low-income families seem to be common victims of electric heater fires because `` they're using them as a basic heating system,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> staffer. The next greatest threat is from kerosene heaters `` which people turn to if their power is turned off,'' the staffer said. Flare-up or uncontrolled flaming, which can happen when improper or contaminated fuels are used, is cited as a prime factor in kerosene-related accidents. People should never use gasoline or other fuels in kerosene heaters. Both kerosene and gas heaters emit air pollutants that can build up to dangerous levels in enclosed rooms. Areas where they are used should be well ventilated. Incorrect setting of the wick in kerosene heaters also can contribute to escaping pollutants. The <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> says people should follow the manufacturer's suggestion on wick settings. The agency also says people with older unvented gas-fired space heaters should replace them with models manufactured after December 1981. That is when they were required to be equipped with sensors that automatically shut off the heaters if the oxygen levels in the surrounding area fall too low. Fireplaces and wood - and coal-burning stove also are associated with numerous deaths and thousands of home fires which begin in the chimney and are often caused by a buildup of creosote, a tar-like residue Regular service from a qualified chimney sweep can prevent the buildup. The sweep can also check the structural integrity of both the fireplace and chimney. Experts offer these further tips on heating your home safely: _ Follow manufacturers instructions for installation, operation and maintenance of heating appliances. _ Keep children and pets away from heating appliances. _ Do n't use supplemental heating appliances as a substitute for a central heating system. _ Never use a space heater overnight in a room where you are sleeping. _ Check and maintain proper ventilation in rooms where a gas or kerosene heater is used. _ Place heaters on the floor at least three feet away from combustible items such as bedding, furniture and draperies. _ Do n't use heaters in wet or moist places such as bathrooms unless they are specifically designed and tested for those locations. _ Do n't use extension cords with electric heaters unless absolutely necessary and keep all cords on top of rugs or carpets to prevent overheating. _ Use only 1K kerosene in kerosene heaters. _ Have chimneys checked by a qualified chimney sweep before and during the heating season. _ Hownowners and mobile home residents who use electric heat tapes or pipe heating cables to protect exposed water lines from freezing over the winter should inspect them for cracks, char marks or baring and replace them if necessary. _ Keep a properly functioning smoke detector on each level of your home, preferably close to sleeping areas. _ Check smoke detector batteries frequently and replace as needed.

 Rebel soldiers Saturday surrendered their last stronghold and ended their eight-day revolt, the sixth and bloodiest attempt to oust President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. The military said three brigadier generals and at least 12 middle-grade officers would be relieved of their duties for joining the coup attempt, which left at least 83 dead and more than 580 wounded. In the capital, an assailant hurled a grenade into the main post office Saturday, killing two people and wounding 18. It was unclear if the attack was related to the coup attempt. About 400 troops had held the <LOCATION> Mactan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 350 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, since the coup attempt began Dec. 1. `` Mactan airport in <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> is now back to normal operations after the rebel group surrendered to government troops ... this morning,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said in a statement. ` This is good news for our people who have overwhelmingly demonstrated their abhorrence for the violence espoused by the mutineers,'' she said, referring to Friday's demonstration in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in support of her government. Most of the rebel soldiers who had held the base began leaving for <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> island, where they came from. The rest marched back to their barracks inside the base, witnesses said. Loyal forces began clearing the base of booby traps planted by mutineers. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, government regional military chief, refused to give details of surrender terms but said he will recommend no charges be brought against the rebel soldiers. `` Here in <LOCATION> Mactan </LOCATION>, not a single shot was fired, so they have not caused anything ... that will call for serious repercussion,'' he said. `` I think that is a very good mitigating circumstance. In other words, we did not fight.'' Participants in past coups received little or no punishment, and in one instance mutineers were let off with 30 push-ups. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was swept into office during the February 1986 `` people power'' revolution that forced <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> into exile after 20 years in power. On Friday, more than 100,000 people gathered in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in a show of support for Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. During the rally, she hit back at her chief critic, Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON>, and said he `` can not wait to be president. I will never give up that position to him.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> spoke on the site where hundreds of thousands of Filipinos filled the streets in 1986 to prevent tanks from attacking dissident officers who had mutinied against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. The president did not mention complaints by the rebels and other critics that she has failed to deliver on promises of social justice and reform. The reported settlement showed just how far both sides softened to end the revolt. On Dec. 2, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> ruled out negotiations and warned the mutineers to `` surrender or die.'' But she stepped aside to allow loyal military commanders to resolve the crisis peacefully. Before the surrender, the rebel commander, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Commendador </PERSON>, refused to abandon control of the air base, saying his troops `` have opted to die.'' The surrender of the <LOCATION> Mactan </LOCATION> holdouts brought to at least 1,900 the number of rebels in government hands. The military estimates about 3,000 soldiers joined the coup attempt, and the whereabouts of many rebels remained unclear. Military officials said lower-ranking officers and enlisted men would be reassigned to other units, as has generally been the case after previous coup attempts. The coup attempt began when rebel forces bombed the presidential palace and seized several military garrisons near <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on Dec. 1 Government forces, backed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-4 Phantom fighter jets flying cover, retook the garrisons. Another rebel group holding out in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s financial district surrendered Thursday.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> began a week of naval maneuvers in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on Saturday, and one senior Iranian official said the war games were the most extensive since the Islamic revolution 10 years ago. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s state-run radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said the air force and army also would take part in the maneuvers over a `` wide area'' of the gulf, the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> and the strategic <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>. It said navy destroyers, missile ships, troop carriers, Hovercraft, air force fighter jets, mine-detecting helicopters and special Revolutionary Guards naval units were participating. A senior Iranian official identified only as <PERSON> Izadi </PERSON> said, `` These naval maneuvers are the biggest since the victory of the Islamic revolution in 1979,'' the radio reported. The report said <PERSON> Izadi </PERSON> was speaking from a warship participating in the exercises. The maneuvers are code-named Zulfiqar-5 after the legendary double-edged sword of <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, son-in-law of the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> is revered by <PERSON> Shiite </PERSON> <PERSON> Moslems </PERSON> as a spiritual leader. Zulfiqar-5 is `` aimed at coordinating the forces of the Iranian navy and the Revolutionary Guards, and at upgrading the expert defense capabilities of the forces in Iranian and international waters,'' the radio said. President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said last month the navy had acquired `` vital equipment'' that would improve its capability. He did not elaborate. But Western military analysts believe he may have been indicating that Chinese-made Silkworm anti-ship missiles have been deployed on Iranian warships for the first time. The analysts said the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> navy has been seeking a new seaborne missile system. The Iranians are believed to have test-fired a ship-borne Silkworm missile in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> three months ago. The maneuvers are the second major naval exercise since last year's cease-fire in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. They are the first since <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader and chief of the armed forces, dropped Rear Adm. <PERSON> Mohammad-Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Malekzadegan </PERSON> as naval commander last month. <PERSON> Malekzadegan </PERSON> had commanded the navy since 1982. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> replaced him with <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamkhani </PERSON>, who had been minister of the Revolutionary Guards. Since 1979, the Revolutionary Guards have become the biggest military group in the armed forces, with an estimated 350,000 men and their own air and naval operations. Some Iranian leaders, including <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, have sought to merge the often unruly Revolutionary Guards with the more disciplined regular armed forces. But such a move has been opposed by <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, revolutionary hard-liners, Guards members and the regular forces themselves. Poor coordination, and often open hostility, between the Guards members and the regular army severely hampered <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s military operations during the war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamkhani </PERSON>'s appointment, the first involving the transfer of a Revolutionary Guards commander into the regular forces, was seen as a move to improve ties between the branches and defuse criticism of military policy by the Guards. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said last month that <PERSON> Shamkhani </PERSON>, who was promoted to rear admiral, `` is expected to come up with an efficient naval combination in the gulf'' and improve coordination between naval and Guards forces.

<HEAD>Pioneer of Action Painting Dead at 85</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANTIBES, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartung </PERSON>, a German-born artist who was one of the founders of abstract painting, has died at his home in the south of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, a friend said. He was 85. <PERSON> Hartung </PERSON> died Friday with several friends gathered at his bedside. The friend who disclosed the death spoke on condition of anonymity and did not give the cause of death. <PERSON> Hartung </PERSON> was a pioneer of action painting, the form of abstract expressionism born when artists splattered or dripped paint to create fluid, and seemingly `` impulsive'' compositions. French Culture Minister <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> said in a statement that <PERSON> Hartung </PERSON> was `` a man of creation and freedom,'' and `` one of those who constructed the new pictorial language of our time.'' The German-born <PERSON> Hartung </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for more than 50 years and lost a leg fighting for the French in World War II. Despite illness and old age, he continued to paint each day, standing propped up by his assistants. He splashed canvases big and small with the pure, bright colors that had long been his trademark. He was equally at ease with chalk, ink, watercolors, acrylic and oils. Best known for big, bold abstract canvases, <PERSON> Hartung </PERSON> said his painting was `` impulsive, the expression of deep emotion.'' `` I paint when I want to convey a certain feeling,'' he said in a 1984 interview. <PERSON> Hartung </PERSON> was born Sept. 21, 1904, in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the son of a well-to-do doctor who once told him to abandon art if he wanted to make money. He studied philosophy and art history at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leipzig </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hartung </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1926 and worked under painter <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> Leger </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Hartung </PERSON> struck out on his own when <PERSON> Leger </PERSON> tried to tell him what to do. His approach to abstract art was anything but conventional. Besides brushes, he liked to use his thumbs, fingernails, hair brushes, mops, even a sawed-off broom and anything else capable of spreading paint on canvases that often covered half a wall. He was married, divorced and remarried after the war to <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>, also a well-known painter. <PERSON> Hartung </PERSON> once said his favorite accomplishment was his home _ a white, Bauhaus-style house-workshop in the hills behind <LOCATION> Antibes </LOCATION>. He designed the vast home himself, `` down to the last detail _ no stairs.'' He wrote many books, including `` Self-Portrait,'' in 1976. He was commander of the French Legion of Honor and he earned several war honors.

 With $ 15 million spent and no solution in sight, authorities are thinking of disbanding the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and say that the elusive serial killer of as many as 49 women may remain unknown forever. Forty to 50 people remain under investigation in the nation's worst serial murder case Without some breakthrough, those queries should be completed in about a year, said King County Police Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of the unit. The task force was formed in 1984 to probe the deaths or disappearances of as many as 49 young women, most with links to prostitution, in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> from the summer of 1982 to early 1984. The case takes its name from the river near where the first five victims were found. Police spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the county alone has spent some $ 15 million on the case, which investigators admit could wind up as much a mystery as the identity of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Ripper </PERSON>, the unknown person who mutilated and murdered five prostitutes in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> a century ago, or the Zodiac killer who stalked <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciscans </LOCATION> two decades ago and sent taunting notes to authorities. Five months ago, a former law student who was also a prison escapee was labeled a `` viable suspect'' by investigators. But <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, 38, was cleared in the case Nov. 30. Other men studied by the task force have not even reached `` viable'' status. For example, a 34-year-old man was arrested Nov. 16 in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, in a police-style car found to contain guns, knives, <PERSON> Mace </PERSON>, a machete, 10 feet of rope, pornographic videos and identification listing eight addresses and various names. Investigators have speculated that the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killer posed as a police officer to trap his victims. But <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said the man arrested in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> apparently spent too little time in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area to rank higher than `` not very likely.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and Sheriff <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said the 19-member task force probably would lose a detective or two next month. A budget for 1990 approved by the <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> would cut two detectives from the major crimes unit, which houses the task force, and at least one probably will come from the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> probe, <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said. At its height, the task force had separate offices and involved about 70 staff members from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, King and <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> counties and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. While task force members still work almost full-time on <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, `` they're awfully close to being melded in -LRB- with the major crimes unit -RRB- right now,'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said. `` 1990 is probably going to be the transition year.'' Without significant new leads, he said, `` I think the ability to specifically identify the task force will disappear,'' probably after January 1991. Besides 41 known <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> victims, the case includes the disappearance of eight others who fit the victim profile, generally young and linked to prostitution or other street life. `` Murder and prostitution go hand in hand, and they have since the very beginning of time, I believe,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. Four were found near <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, one not far from <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, one in a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> park and the rest around <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Cause of death was listed as strangling in the first five cases, but authorities have cited only `` homicidal violence'' since then. `` There was clothing found at some of the sites ... but the absence of clothing is a significant factor at many of the sites,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. Since the first five bodies were found, most of the remains have been little more than bones. Investigators are even undecided on how many killers were involved. `` I do n't think there is a dominant theory,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` It could be two, maybe even three, separate serial murder cases.'' As is customary in widely publicized murder investigations, authorities have withheld some details of the crimes. Even if the investigation winds down in coming years, <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said, those details will remain known only to authorities and the killer. `` I do n't think it's in the public's best interest, certainly in the victims' families' best interests, to lay open the entire file ... for the foreseeable future,'' the sheriff said.

 The government on Saturday flew a jailed Moslem militant to the city of <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION> to negotiate the release of a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister's daughter, under death threat from her Moslem abductors, police sources said. Armed gunmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Kashmir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> on Friday kidnapped <PERSON> Rubaiya </PERSON> <PERSON> Mufti </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, daughter of Home Minister <PERSON> Mufti </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>, a city in <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state. The front has been fighting since 1965 for the state's secession from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, saying <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION>'s Moslems are discriminated against by <PERSON> Hindus </PERSON>, a majority in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON> on Tuesday became <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s first Moslem home minister. The appointment was seen as an effort to stem the war in <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> and another by Sikhs fighting for autonomy in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state. Police sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the government flew <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Akram </PERSON>, a top militant of the front, from <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION> to establish contact with his organization and negotiate the woman's freedom. <PERSON> Akram </PERSON> was captured two weeks ago and jailed at <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION>, 95 miles south of <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>. He was accompanied by a police team that will remain with him until contact is established with the kidnappers, the sources said. <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Raza </PERSON>, the state's top government official, told reporters that `` non-political and non-government people have initiated the process of negotiations.'' He refused to name them. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency, quoting unnamed sources, said government agents had met with the militants. The report could not be immediately confirmed. The kidnappers threatened to kill <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON> if five jailed front militants are not freed by Monday. It also threatened to kidnap police officers' relatives if the demands are not met. Officials said the government of Prime Minister V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who took office a week ago, on Saturday flew commandos to <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>. The commandos were asked to stand by. Miss <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, a 22-year-old medical student and intern at a <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION> hospital, was kidnapped on her way home from work Friday afternoon. Members of the front later telephoned her home and demanded the release of the five militants as ransom. In the statement delivered to <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION> newspapers, the front demanded the release of <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hami </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheikh </PERSON>, a top leader of the group. Sheikh was arrested last month after a clash with police. The four other militants the front wants released are <PERSON> Noor </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalwal </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Altaf </PERSON>, <PERSON> Javed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zargar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Azad </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON> met reporters in his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> office on Saturday. `` I am in touch with developments,'' he said. As home minister, he is in charge of police and internal security. The kidnapping came a day after <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON> was appointed head of a government committee set up to solve the disputes in <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. After taking office Dec. 2, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> appeared on national television and vowed to reconcile regional conflicts. <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>'s appointment to the key home ministry post was seen as an effort to help ease tensions between Hindus and Moslems in the country. <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> is the only Indian state with a Moslem majority. Militants claim it should be an independent nation or part of <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Moslems make up 64 percent of the state but nationwide they form only 11 percent of the population. Hindus comprise 80 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people.

Less than two hours later, a British squadron put to sea and by that evening all but one of the German ships had been sunk. Twenty-five years later, the German battleship <PERSON> Graf </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Spee </PERSON> was marauding in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, sinking ships. The British <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> believed the ship would sooner or later try to find new prizes in the mouth of the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plate </LOCATION> on the east coast of the continent.

<TEXT>
 An Iranian-backed fundamentalist group linked to the holding of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> hostages said Saturday it had thwarted an attempt to assassinate its mentor. A car rigged with 200 pounds of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> was parked off the road that <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> takes daily from his house to <PERSON> Beir </PERSON> el-Abed mosque in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums, said a statement by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. Police said the bomb-laden car was set to be detonated by remote contol. They said they could not confirm it was intended to kill <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>. The bomb was safely defused in the car, which was parked in front of a bank about 100 yards from the mosque and 1.2 miles from the Shiite Moslem cleric's house in <LOCATION> Haret </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hreik </LOCATION> district, the statement said. <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, 54, is the spiritual guide of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, believed to be the umbrella of <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> extremist factions holding most of the 18 Western hostages, including eight Americans, in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. There was no indication who might have engineered the bombing attempt. It was reported shortly after a cease-fire halted 24 hours of street battles between <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia in which police said 13 people were killed and 22 wounded. Assassinations by car bombs or bomb blasts have long been a byproduct of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. The latest was the remote-controlled bomb that killed President <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> and 23 others in <LOCATION> Moslem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Nov. 22, just 17 days after his election. No one claimed responsibility. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> was elected as part of an Arab League-sponsored pact aimed at ending the war. His election was opposed by the country's Christian leader and army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, because the pact does not provide a timetable for the removal of Syrian troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> The Syrians were deployed here in 1976 under a peackeeping mandate. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said they violated the mandate by siding with the Moslems in the war.

<HEAD>Trial Offers Intriguing Glimpse Into Defense Industry</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The trial of a former <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> marketing executive offers an intriguing glimpse into an `` old-boy'' network of defense contractors in which classified documents were freely swapped, no questions asked. During three days of testimony last week, witnesses spun tales that could have come right out of a spy novel: car trunks stuffed with documents; shadowy figures who may have sold the documents; secret stashes; and document destruction _ sometimes in home fireplaces. The swapping of documents during the late 1970s and 1980s was described as `` endemic'' and `` common'' and there was an `` unspoken agreement'' that no one questioned where the documents came from, not even <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> investigators. One witness said he was under pressure from his boss to secure the documents and others said their companies felt they had a `` need to know'' what was in the documents. Most of those involved in the document ring were former military officers who had served in the Pentagon prior to going to work for defense contractors. Prosecutors described <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, who worked for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> from 1978 until he was fired in 1986 after an investigation was begun, as the `` linchpin'' of a document trading ring that involved employees of nine major defense contractors. After deliberating only two hours, a federal court jury convicted <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> on 39 counts arising from his possession of the secret budget documents. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> earlier had pleaded guilty to receiving classified documents and agreed to pay $ 5.2 million in fines. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the eastern district of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, refused to comment after the trial on whether such practices continue in the defense community, but he did indicate there were ongoing investigations. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>'s trial `` sends a clear message it wo n't be tolerated.'' The documents were known as `` planning, programming and budget system documents'' and included detailed budget information for projects such as the Strategic Defense Initiative, long-range ballistic missiles, <ORGANIZATION> AWACS </ORGANIZATION> aircraft, military satellite communications and expendable launch vehicles. Former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, along with two former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> comptrollers, a military adviser to former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and a string of generals, testified that the documents were never intended for release to defense contractors. One general said the contractors had broken the `` rules of engagement'' by getting the documents and another said the documents provided the contractors with a `` significant advantage'' because it gave them a road map to future military spending plans. But despite testimony that everyone knew the documents were off-limits to contractors, they often were on the street within a day after being finalized. <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> regularly logged the documents into the classified document log at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s office in <LOCATION> Rosslyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. During the eight years he worked for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> those logs were inspected at least 13 times by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> inspectors. `` The generals said that everyone knew the documents were restricted, but the exception apparently was the trained bloodhounds of DIS,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bray </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>'s attorney, said during closing arguments. <PERSON> Bray </PERSON> insisted throughout the trial that the only reason <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> was prosecuted was because he refused to give investigators the names of his <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources. <PERSON> Bray </PERSON> also argued that the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s industrial security manual was unclear and confusing as to the release and handling of the documents. Testimony indicated that employees from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bendix </PERSON>, RCA, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gruman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> were involved in exchanging documents. Some witnesses said they knew they should n't have had the documents, while others insisted they had followed proper procedures in getting them. The documents were important when contractors were trying to decide whether to pump millions of their own dollars into developing projects that the Pentagon may or may not go forward with. One witness said the documents let the contractors know just how serious the government was about pursuing a project. No one alleged during the trial that the documents were stolen in `` some midnight, black-bag job at the Pentagon.'' <PERSON> Bray </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> refused to give the investigators the names of his sources because he knew `` they would be goners.''

Other members of the delegation included Reps. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>.; and <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON>, On Saturday, they visited the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> side of the wall at <LOCATION> Potsdamer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platz </LOCATION>, just a few minutes' walk from <LOCATION> Brandenburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION>. A couple of them chipped away pieces of the cement barrier for souvenirs. As the chipping continued, with <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> energetically flailing at the wall with hammer and chisel, spraying bits of cement all over the place, <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> spoke about the group's earlier visit in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Turning around to look back to where <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> was banging away at the wall, <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> said, `` The status of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> was not discussed by us in any depth. But it will be much more open. The breaking of the wall is a symbol of that.'' During the talks, <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> told the delegation he thinks Soviet troops based in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> could be withdrawn soon, <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> said. `` He did n't give a real timetable for the withdrawal, but did mention in two to three years,'' <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has about 400,000 troups based in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> number about 250,000. East German deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Krabatsch </PERSON>, who also met with the delegation, said he expects the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to withdraw some of its forces. The talks only lightly touched on discussion of reunification of the two German states, he said. `` We got the feeling that even the opposition -LRB- in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- is worried about how capitalism would be for the poor,'' <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s social net is aimed at ensuring cradle-to-grave security for its citizens, with everyone supposedly gainfully employed. <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> said he sees no precedent for what the East Germans have in mind for establishing a new political system, something between communism and capitalism where `` there's no real model for them to follow.'' `` The East Germans are in a transitional period,'' he added. `` It will take time for them to master the situation.'' `` Most of the people we talked to said the borders wo n't change, and I'm talking about -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s -RRB- border with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but the wall will go, only a few pieces will remain as a reminder,'' <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> predicted.

<HEAD>Apartheid Foes Gather for Largest Conference Ever</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 4,500 activists Saturday opened the largest-ever anti-apartheid conference with hopes of finding new tactics to topple the white minority government. Black, white, Indian and mixed-race members of about 2,100 organizations _ some of them ideological rivals in past years _ filled a university hall for the Conference for a Democratic Future. `` The regime ... has done its utmost to break us: whipping our people, declaring the states of emergency, assassinating and detaining our leaders,'' said the keynote speaker, <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>. `` It has failed. We gather here in greater numbers than ever before.'' Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>, an industrial city near <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, police used tear gas to break up clashes between white extremists and scores of mixed-race people who came to picnic at a whites-only park. Ten people were arrested, police said. <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> has been beset by racial tension since far-right candidates won control of the municipal council last year. Civic leaders in <LOCATION> Rieger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>'s mixed-race neighborhood, organized the picnic to protest alleged assaults on mixed-race women by members of the neo-Nazi <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. The government chose to allow the anti-apartheid conference even though many participants belong to groups banned under terms of the 3 -LCB- - year-old state of emergency A similar conference was prohibited last year shortly before it was to open. The agenda for this year's gathering included plans for mass protests and the possible formation of a new organization encompassing all the participating groups. Decisions reached at the conference were expected to be announced Sunday. `` Your diversity is our strength,'' <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> said. `` The gigantic task of this conference is to confirm the crucial importance of unity, and to plan a program of mass action ... that will challenge the apartheid state.'' <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, 77, was freed unconditionally in October by President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> after 26 years in prison. But <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> had no praise for the president or the white-controlled government's offer to negotiate some form of black political rights that stops short of majority rule. `` Mr. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, your back is to the wall,'' <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> said. `` Come stand on the floor of a conference like this. ... Submit to the processes of democracy.'' <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, during four months in power, has moved faster toward reform than his predecessors. `` But we know he has limits beyond which he will not go,'' <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> said. `` We reiterate our commitment to one person, one vote ... as the non-negotiable principle on which a future <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will be built,'' he said. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has said he supports giving <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 28 million blacks some form of power but not the concept of one person, one vote. The nation's 5 million whites control the economy and the government. Observers from 19 countries were present, including <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Knut </PERSON> <PERSON> Wollenback </PERSON>, and a Soviet professor, <PERSON> Irina </PERSON> <PERSON> Filatova </PERSON> It was the first time in decades that a Soviet attended an opposition meeting here, and she was cheered loudly during brief remarks to the crowd. Also granted observer status was the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which some blacks reject because it holds seats in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Full-fledged delegates included white civil rights activists, black businessmen, and anti-apartheid politicians from the semi-autonomous black homelands. Black groups espousing the so-called Africanist philosophy _ which views South African whites as settlers who should be ousted _ rejected invitations to attend. Africanist leaders said they were excluded from planning the conference and that they opposed the inclusion of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the homeland parties. Also absent was Inkatha, the 1.5-million member Zulu organization. Inkatha opposes militant forms of protest but has been feuding violently with groups aligned with the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Thus, most of the participants shared to some degree the general policies of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, which espouses a non-racial philosophy and has said it would negotiate with the government if certain pre-conditions were met. The bid for unity did receive a boost through the participation of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consciousness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which in the past has opposed the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s non-racial approach.

 <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> strides into the mayor's crowded office, flashing a smile and shaking hands, looking more like a confident <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leader than a politician in deep trouble But the 75-year-old <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, a virtual institution in a state not known for cultural or political permanence, faces the most serious crisis of his career as federal agents and a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee investigate whether he improperly intervened with government regulators in the failure of Lincoln Savings and Loan. On Friday, a <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> statewide survey of 2,046 voters reported that <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s image had nosedived, with 58 percent of those polled saying they had an unfavorable impression of the senator. In October, before the scandal had begun to snowball, a similar poll reported <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> had a 56 percent favorable rating. Nonetheless, other recent polls have shown the senator holding his own among voters. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, the majority whip and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 2 Democrat, told a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> news conference Friday that the Times' latest poll was the result of `` bad press and wild charges.'' He also said _ again _ that he will seek a fifth term in 1992, responding to a fellow Democrat, Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON>, who urged <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> to consider not running. `` From everything I know about <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, he will be a candidate in 1992,'' said <PERSON> Darry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sragow </PERSON>, who managed <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s successful campaign against <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> entrepreneur <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zschau </PERSON> in 1986 `` This -LRB- <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> -RRB- wo n't stop him.'' But others are n't so sure. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, with an independent prosecutor, is investigating allegations that <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and four other senators improperly intervened with federal officials 2 -LCB- years ago when they wanted to shut down <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan, the Irvine-based thrift. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was finally taken over this year, and it is estimated the move will cost taxpayers up to $ 2 billion, possibly the most expensive thrift institution failure in the nation's history. In addition, some 23,000 <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> customers bought $ 250 million in worthless bonds, purchases which critics say could have been avoided if government regulators had closed the thrift down at the time. For the past two weeks, the senator has crisscrossed the state in a whirlwind, campaign-style tour from the far north to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. The visits include town hall meetings on crime prevention, fund-raisers to tap wealthy farmers and meetings with local officials who hope the lawmaker can cut red tape on federal earthquake relief. It was such a visit that brought him to this quake-shaken city last week. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s office said the senator had scheduled 37 events between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15. That kind of heavy scheduling rivals <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s calendar during his 1986 campaign. To repeated questions about whether his schedule was prompted by his problems with <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> has replied that he is taking advantage of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> holiday recess to handle constituent needs, especially in light of the October earthquake in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. Responding to questions about his role in the burgeoning scandal surrounding the collapse of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Savings </PERSON> and his relationship to <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s high-spending owner, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> says that he has done nothing wrong, that he only asked federal officials to expedite their decision-making. `` For God's sake, if a senator is not supposed to speak to regulators who are on somebody's back, and seek to make sure they are being treated fairly, and to end the process, what is a senator supposed to do?'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> recently told the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. Thus far, many people appear to believe him. `` He's honest and he's smart. It's a lot of media hype,'' said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 28, an <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> woman who happened to be in the city hall vicinity at the time of <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s visit. In <LOCATION> Azusa </LOCATION>, before another meeting, smiling high school students waved to <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> and asked to have their pictures taken with him. But <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> received $ 47,000 in campaign donations from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and solicited $ 850,000 from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> on behalf of three tax-exempt voter registration groups, including one headed by his son <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>. On top of the <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> savings probe, <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> must deal with reports that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> are studying the voter registration organizations to find out whether they attempted to register more Democrats than Republicans, a violation for such tax-exempt groups. `` It makes my blood boil,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> news conference last week. `` It began as a story about five senators in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and it is rapidly becoming a story about a failure to act in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Sragow </PERSON>, who currently manages former <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON>'s run for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination next year. The other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators being probed are <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>. State authorities also are investigating <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s collapse, trying to determine whether <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> regulators _ appointees of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> _ were pressured by <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s largess to go easy on <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, his companies or his associates donated at least $ 150,000 to <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>'s political campaign.

<HEAD>Mayoral Honeymoon? Forget About It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL STIEG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Before Mayor-elect <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> named a police commissioner or a sanitation chief, he hired a criminal defense lawyer. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, who becomes <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s first black mayor in three weeks, has n't had much time to enjoy his Nov. 7 election. There was a celebration, followed by a vacation in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, followed by a federal investigation into a stock deal with his son. Cancel those honeymoon plans. `` As a matter of fact, the absence of a honeymoon may have a silver lining because no matter what happens, how bad can it be? Look what I've been through,'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said last week. How bad can it get? One columnist wrote of an `` Eddie II'' scenario, in which <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> resigns and the current mayor, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, wins a special election. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> had dashed <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s hopes for a fourth term by beating him in the September Democratic primary. Another columnist, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Breslin </PERSON>, likened <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> to a horseplayer who holds a winning ticket, only to see his number flashing on the parimutuel board, indicating an inquiry. Around City Hall, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, next in line should a mayor step down, is jokingly called <PERSON> Mayor-Elect-Elect </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>. All this may seem a bit harsh, since <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' finances were picked over quite thoroughly during the campaign, especially by his opponent, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. And still, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> won. So what's the fuss? `` No law has been violated by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> or his son,'' said his lawyer, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stillman </PERSON>. `` This is a simple transaction between a father and son that has been blown out of proportion.'' Others say it was n't so simple. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> acquired stock in 1972 in a fledgling company, <ORGANIZATION> Inner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The company prospered, and in 1985 when <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> became <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> borough president, he transfered the stock to his son, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. He told a newspaper in 1986 that it was a gift, and his failure to file a federal gift tax return became a campaign issue this year. In response, he produced a handwritten note from his son, dated 1985, which said the stock was sold for $ 58,000 plus interest, due in 1991. Investigators are analyzing the paper and ink in the note to try to determine when it was written. And if it was a sale, it was n't listed on his city financial disclosure forms. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' son and the president of Inner City refuse to reveal stock certificates or other documents that might prove when the stock was transferred. Another twist: Before selling it for $ 58,000, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> valued the stock at $ 1 million on a state form. He said the value was an estimate of what the company would bring if broken up and sold; $ 58,000 was the market value. None of which helps a man who had to listen to campaign-trail reminders that he did n't file tax returns from 1969-72. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> defeated one federal prosecutor, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, only to find another, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>, looking into his affairs. <PERSON> Stillman </PERSON> has called the investigation `` <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s last hurrah,'' though <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> denies having anything to do with the investigation by <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> is based in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s base as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney was <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. At most of his public appearances, the mayor-elect is greeted by reporters with questions. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' famed patience is wearing thin, though he says, `` I recognize that when you seek or hold public office there seems to be a new set of rules.'' Meanwhile, other problems cropped up: _ The city <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> is investigating his votes on cable television franchises when he was borough president The DOI is also looking into the stock deal. _ Newspapers carried stories pointing out that he had not named his Cabinet as quickly as other mayors had; <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> deflected some of that by appointing eight top aides Friday _ His new press secretary, Pulitzer Prize-winner <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON>, admitted having given <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> advice during the campaign while still working at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, contrary to the newspaper's And in the background is <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, now a private citizen but occasionally in the public eye. He suggested that the city unite behind the mayor-elect. But he repeated something from the campaign, that `` it would be very, very difficult for a mayor, or a prospective mayor, to take on the responsibilities of government if he were under investigation.'' Just how difficult may be seen shortly.

 The leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday they support the reunification of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> but that other European borders must remain untouched. The 12-member <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> announced its support after West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> would not try to reclaim territories the German states held before World War II. `` We have a responsibility toward our neighbors. We want to do nothing destabilizing,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said as the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> completed a two-day summit in this French city on the German border. Eventual reunification seems possible in light of the political upheaval in <LOCATION> Communist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. But the prospect has raised fears that a large German state would upset the political and economic balance in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s powerhouse economy already dominates the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am not afraid of reunification,'' said <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. `` I consider it to be legitimate.'' But he also said countries must abide by international treaties and other obligations `` unless they are prepared to create dangerous and unnecessary tensions.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, who failed to slow the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>'s drive toward European economic integration, still praised the outcome of the summit. Despite their disagreements, she said, the leaders showed they `` can act as the driving force for the development of the whole of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at a turning point in the continent's history.'' Added <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>: `` Henceforth there is no longer a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in two parts, acting in the shadows or at the initative of the two superpowers.'' The 12 leaders issued a joint statement that said: `` We seek the strengthening of the state of peace in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in which the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> people will regain its unity through free self-determination. `` This process should take place peacefully and democratically.'' Reunification also should occur, the statement said, in the context of the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords on European cooperation and security, which permanently fixed postwar borders. The wording of the statement was agreed to after Dutch Prime Minister <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> and Italian Prime Minister <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> pressed <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> at a dinner Friday night for his definition of reunification. Belgian and Dutch sources, demanding anonymity, said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> made clear that reunification applied only to the two existing German nations and not to German-speaking areas in neighboring countries. Belgian Prime Minister <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> said it was `` the most tense moment'' of an otherwise low-key summit. In their final statement, the leaders said they had no intention of taking advantage of the upheavals in communist <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. They promised to build up the weakened economies of emerging democracies and agreed to set up a European development bank to help. The <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> `` remains the cornerstone of a new European architecture and ... a mooring for a future European equilibrium,'' the statement said. Overriding Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s objections, the other 11 leaders agreed to hold a special conference next December in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to rewrite parts of their founding Treaty of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. The changes would be needed to carry out a sweeping plan for economic and monetary union that would lead to a common European currency and system of central banks. Any treaty revisions would require unanimous approval. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> objected to monetary integration, saying it would rob member countries of sovereign rights to decide national economic policy. She also was alone in opposing the summit's adoption of a `` social charter'' on employment and other worker rights. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said the non-binding charter would increase unemployment, raise costs and make <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> goods less competitive. Common Market members are <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>.

President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s political reforms have outpaced the 1977 Soviet constitutional provision, Article 6, that makes the 20-million-member party the guiding force in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> society, <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> told reporters. `` In general terms, we are not clinging to Article 6 in the form in which it is included in the constitution,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said. `` It is not our point that it must be kept there at any cost.'' The debate over the party's role reflects a building debate in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> following fast-moving reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has dropped the name Communist from the party's name and is preparing for multiparty elections; <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has installed a non-Communist prime minister; and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have repealed the Communists' monopoly on power. On Thursday, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> became the first Soviet republic to drop a constitutional guarantee of Communist power and approve a multiparty system. The 250-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> elevated the new party chief of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivashko </PERSON> to membership on the ruling Politburo. It also named the recently appointed editor of Pravda, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>, to the Secretariat, which handles the day-to-day running of party business, and discussed preparations for this week's reconvening of the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and several other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies have called a brief general strike Monday to show popular support for removing the party clause from the constitution. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, echoing a policy announced more than a year ago by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said the party's goal is to `` move away from being the guiding nucleus of the whole government structure to becoming a political vanguard.'' For more than seven decades, the party has dictated everything from the direction of Soviet foreign policy to how much collective farms should produce and how much state stores charge for a bar of soap. `` Some of the wording of the current Article 6 clashes with new plans for the party's development,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said. The wide debate in Soviet society over changing the party's legal status _ once an unthinkable topic for public debate here _ was not `` a taboo subject,'' he said However, he accused <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> of unethnical conduct for calling a general strike. `` We do not have to act under the pressure of emotion,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said. `` We do not need an approach to the constitution that would focus on just one article without suggesting anything in the way of replacement.'' He denounced what he called attempts to use the debate to fuel `` political speculation'' that would damage the party. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said remarks at the plenary session by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on the party's constitutional status would be printed in the state-run press on Sunday. <PERSON> Ivashko </PERSON> was promoted to the Politburo, succeeding his predecessor, long-time Ukrainian party boss <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON>, who was retired at the last <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting in September. Two newly named party chiefs in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, the country's two largest cities, failed to win seats on the party's ruling body in contrast to longstanding practice However, <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidaspov </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had been named to the newly created party bureau for the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> federation, which will be chaired by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and provide a separate party leadership for the country's largest republic As often happens before such plenary meetings, the session was preceded by rumors of a shake-up in the leadership. And this time, there was expected to be open division over whether to annul the party's legal monopoly on power. The latest rumors were bolstered by the increasing difficulty Soviet Communists have had preventing their once-monolithic party from breaking into factions. In <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, about 40,000 rank-and-file Communists rallied last week to support <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the face of what they said was a bid by party conservatives to oust him and his allies, including Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The owner of a Domino's pizza franchise has been charged with violating two state labor regulations and could be fined $ 1,000 in connection with a delivery boy's death, state officials say. It is the first time the store owner has been cited in the June 3 death of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colson </PERSON>, 17, of suburban <LOCATION> Plainfield </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Colson </PERSON> was making a pizza delivery on a rain-slicked road in <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> when his company-owned truck struck a utility pole. His mother, <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Boutros </PERSON>, has criticized Domino's policy of guaranteeing a pizza delivery within 30 minutes or less, a policy she believes contributed to her son's death. <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pizza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Brownsburg </LOCATION>, which owns three Domino's outlets including the one in <LOCATION> Mooresville </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> worked, violated two rules of the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, officials said Friday. <LOCATION> Mooresville </LOCATION> is 10 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. Cross Country owner <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Osmun </PERSON> did not immediately return a telephone call placed to his office Saturday seeking comment. After <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'s death, Domino's <ORGANIZATION> Pizza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> maintained that the company met a 30-minute delivery guarantee by speedy preparation of the food at its stores, and did not encourage its drivers to speed. In their citations, officials maintained Cross Country `` did not furnish a place of employment which was free from recognized hazards that were causing or likely to cause death.'' The second citation accused the company of failing to promptly report the boy's death to the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Cross Country has until mid-December to file an appeal. On Friday, <PERSON> Boutros </PERSON> questioned whether a $ 1,000 fine was sufficient penalty. `` I'm glad to see some action has been taken, but I think that's a small fine to pay,'' she said

<HEAD>HUD Alters Rule, Will Allow Jesus Picture at Homeless Shelter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> has revoked its ban on religious decorations in federally funded shelters and will allow a <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> homeless shelter to display a picture of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> chapter in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> refused for months to take down the picture, despite a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> policy against such displays. But a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday that the agency has amended its policy. `` Essentially, it means that if there is no other indication of religious influence, religious decorations will be permitted,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenison </PERSON>, an associate general counsel for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kenison </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> controversy was partly responsible for the change. In May, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials they could not keep a $ 9,635 grant for the shelter because of the picture. The money was not returned, but the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> did not apply for another grant. Under the new policy, which is still subject to congressional review, the picture will not diminish the shelter's chance of getting federal money in the future. But other regulations, including one that forbids promoting religious beliefs, still will apply, <PERSON> Kenison </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials welcomed the change, saying it will allow shelters with religious affiliations to preserve their principles. `` To ask them to compromise their religious beliefs because there is some part of government funds in the program seems a little harsh,'' said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON>, social services secretary for the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s eastern chapters.

 Two stone-throwing Palestinians were shot and killed in a clash with soldiers in this hilltop village Saturday as the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation entered its third year. One Palestinian also was shot and seriously wounded during the confrontation, and three others suffered gunshot wounds when troops opened fire on other demonstrators, the army said. A general strike was declared throughout the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> by PLO-backed uprising leaders to mark the day, but there were few protests because of widespread curfews confining thousands of people to their homes. Palestinians carried off symbolic acts of defiance. Outlawed Palestinian flags were sent aloft with balloons, and newly painted graffiti praised the uprising, widely known by the Arabic word `` intefadeh.'' Israelis, <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> and peace activists also staged several sympathy protests. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, about 4,000 Israelis joined a candelight march staged by the left-wing group Peace Now. They followed a banner that read `` 143 children, Jewish and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION>, have died in the intefadeh,'' and many carried pictures of the child victims. Another banner said: `` Talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> now.'' In <PERSON> Beni </PERSON> <PERSON> Naim </PERSON>, a Moslem community of about 13,000 people near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, soldiers opened fire as they came under a hail of stones from masked youths and village women. The shooting came as hundreds of villagers marched through the streets with <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and banners. `` We salute and praise our martyrs in the third year of the intefadeh,'' one placard read. The trouble began with masked youths throwing rocks at troops at the village's edge. The troops fired tear gas, and dozens of women began to scream and throw stones. The soldiers opened fire with bullets when they were stoned from all directions, army officials said. They said two people were killed and one wounded. The dead villagers were identified as <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Fattah </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Manasra </PERSON>, a 22-year-old woman shot in the chest, and <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Humeidat </PERSON>, 28. As army helicopters hovered overhead, villagers with olive branches carried Ms. <PERSON> Al-Manasra </PERSON>'s body to the village cemetery. Men took turns carrying <PERSON> Humeidat </PERSON>'s body to the graveyard, each wanting to touch him in a last show of respect. Eight journalists, including <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Haitham </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON>, were detained by the army for more than five hours after they witnessed the soldiers firing at demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beni </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naim </LOCATION>. The journalists, in several cars, were stopped as they left the village. Their film and videotapes were seized. Others detained were reporters or cameramen for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the television agencies Visnews and <ORGANIZATION> WTN </ORGANIZATION>, and two free-lance photographers. They were taken to the <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> police headquarters. Army spokesmen said the eight were not arrested or charged and their release was delayed because the film and tapes were taken to be viewed by military officials. <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> said the journalists were asked if they knew they had entered a closed military area, barred to outsiders. He said he and the others each had to sign a bail warrant for $ 1,500 before their release. The journalists were treated well and given coffee and cakes, <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, a Palestinian who was shot Thursday while assaulting a soldier died of his wounds in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashomer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. He was identified as <PERSON> Atef </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulab </PERSON>, 27, of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> refugee camp Saturday's deaths raised to 629 the number of Palestinians killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers or civilians since the uprising started in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Jebaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp on Dec. 8, 1987. An additional 155 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaboration with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Forty-three Israelis have died in the violence.

 The son of the late Russian author <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON> received his father's Nobel literature prize Saturday, 31 years after it was awarded. Soviet officials forced the writer to refuse the prize when it was awarded to him in 1958 for his celebrated novel, `` Doctor Zhivago.'' He died in 1960. A few days ago, Soviet authorities granted his 66-year-old son, <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON>, permission to travel to <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> to collect the prize. `` Never, ever did I think this could happen ... but the perestroika is so fast sometimes,'' <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON>'s son was quoted as saying by the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION>. Perestroika is Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of political and social reform.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> on Saturday proposed renewing truce talks with leftist guerrillas on Dec. 20 if they stop attacking civilian targets. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s proposal, made on the eve of a summit of the five Central American presidents, appeared to be a concession to get the rebels back to the bargaining table. He also offered a $ 250,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the killers of six Jesuit priests and two others who were slain Nov. 16. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> told a news conference his rightist government `` is willing to renew the process of dialogue on condition the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> publicly pledges by Dec. 15 to end all terrorist actions that directly or indirectly affect the civilian population.'' Since <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> began his five-year term as president on June 1, two rounds of truce talks in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> have ended in deadlock because of government insistence that the rebels disarm immediately and join <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s political life. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said Saturday that he did not expect the rebels to surrender their weapons while talks are under way. `` If they want to remain on <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Volcano </LOCATION>, that's all right, but they should not attack the civilian population,'' he said. He said a meeting between his U.S.-backed government and rebel representatives could be held in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, to arrange a cease-fire and negotiate peace by Feb. 15. The rebels then would be expected to join the political process, <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said. `` When we speak of dialogue, obviously there are issues that have to be negotiated and discussed, but the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> has positions that are absurd and others that can be discussed,'' he said, referring to the rebel organization by its Spanish initials. If the rebels reject his proposal, the armed forces `` will continue to confront them militarily,'' he said. The rebels have accused the government of not negotiating in good faith. They attacked the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> compound in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> with mortars in October, then canceled a third round of talks planned for Nov. 20-21 in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> when a leftist union hall and the offices of a human rights group were bombed, apparently in retaliation. On Nov. 11, the rebels launched the fiercest offensive in their decade-old war. The offensive continued sporadically last week, mostly in the capital. Attacks Friday cut power supplies in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and left the city hall in flames in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Transito </LOCATION>, 75 miles southeast of the capital. An estimated 2,000 people have been killed in the latest round of fighting. More than 72,000 people, mostly civilians, have died since the war began. `` Since Nov. 11 up to now, they -LRB- the rebels -RRB- have not attacked any military objective,'' only civilian targets, <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said. He guaranteed a $ 250,000 cash reward, safety and immunity for anyone providing information or evidence leading to the conviction of those responsible for killing the priests, their cook and her teen-age daughter. Fellow Jesuits have said government soldiers entered the university campus where the priests lived, roused them from bed, shot them to death and mutilated the bodies. A maid at a nearby house, now in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for her own safety, claimed she saw the soldiers enter the Jesuits' house and heard the shots. `` Any person or persons who, against their will or unwittingly, took part indirectly in this who provides relevant information that can clarify this crime, will be awarded -LRB- the money -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said. He said his government has asked for help from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION> and police organizations in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of protesters, many chanting `` Down with the Communists!'' and `` Death to traitors!'' rallied Saturday to demand a multiparty system and the resignation of the government. The Yugoslav news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said in dispatch from <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> that an estimated 5,000 people gathered in the capital's central park in a prelude to a major pro-democracy rally planned for Sunday. The angry demonstration drew a warning from the Communist government, which has been moving to join the reforms sweeping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Government spokesman <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Bokov </PERSON>, in a national broadcast on state television, said the escalation of tensions and actions of `` extremist elements'' could `` put the country decades back.'' The demonstrators, some carrying flags of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> to express their hope of <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> unity, marched to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the people then left, but about 300 continued chanting slogans calling the four decades of Communist rule an era of `` fascist Communism.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said there was no violence. Ten opposition groups recently formed under the new climate of tolerance have organized the rally for Sunday. The leaders are expected to outline a program in preparation for the legalization of all political organizations. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership purged four Politburo members and 22 <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members closely associated with deposed leader <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, who was toppled from power last month. The dismissals left only three people on the 10-member Politburo who had served under <PERSON> Zhikvov </PERSON>, an opponent of major reform. The 10 opposition groups, which joined Thursday in a `` Federation of Democratic Forces,'' are demanding a multiparty system, a market economy, independent unions, a democratic constitution, the rehabilitation of victims of political trials and a free press.

 <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> were the best of neighbors, always willing to join a party, do a favor or check on a friend. But their concern for a neighbor led to their deaths after they stumbled upon her killers, police say. When <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> noticed <PERSON> Ida </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>'s newspaper lying in her driveway last Monday, he and another neighbor, <PERSON> Verna </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>, wanted to make sure the 72-year-old woman was all right. They let themselves in with a key and encountered a teen-age couple who had stayed in the house after burglarizing it, police say. Mrs. <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> was already dead. A short time later, Mrs. <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> grew worried about her husband's absence and went to the <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> home, where she, too, encountered a gunman Hours later, the 69-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> and her 87-year-old husband, a retired architect, would be shot to death and Mrs. <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>, 68, would barely escape with her life. <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 19, was charged Thursday with murder in the deaths of the Haleys and Mrs. <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>. His girlfriend, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfannenstiel </PERSON>, 18, was charged with murder in Mrs. <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>'s death Both of them face a variety of kidnapping, burglary and robbery charges. They have not entered pleas. `` We've had three individuals who were the epitome of respectability all their lives,'' said police spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. `` All were professional people with good educations. And they were tragically murdered by high school dropouts who were going down the wrong track of life.'' The suspects did not know the victims; the crimes were random acts of violence, said <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. `` They picked out Mrs. <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>'s house by happenstance,'' he said. `` It was a burglary. They had tried several other houses, and this one apparently was easier to get into.'' The neighborhood where the victims lived falls short of wealthy but surpasses comfortable. Older homes wear holiday trim of red ribbon and green wreaths and reflect their owners' pride through fresh paint and tidy yards. <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, who lived across the street from the Haleys, called them `` good friends and good neighbors. They'd always do what they could to help you out in any way.'' Court and police records outline a chain of events dictated by chance. Investigators said they determined what happened through interviews with Mrs. <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Pfannenstiel </PERSON>, who is cooperating with police. After breaking into Mrs. <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>'s house late Sunday night, investigators said, the suspects robbed the retired real estate agent of $ 70, suffocated her and stuffed her body in the trunk of a car before dumping it in a rural area of neighboring <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The two returned to her house and opened her wrapped Christmas packages, looking for things to steal. They spent the night in the house, and were surprised when the neighbors let themselves in to check on Mrs. <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> the next day. Ms. <PERSON> Pfannenstiel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> alone drove the <LOCATION> Haleys </LOCATION> and Mrs. <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> to the same area where Mrs. <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>'s body had been dumped. During the drive, the three neighbors offered to give <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> $ 1,000 each to let them go, an offer he appeared to consider. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> ordered them to lie on an embankment while he went to make sure Mrs. <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> was dead, police said. The three ran into the woods, and Mrs. <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> volunteered to go for help while the other two hid. She found her way to safety, unhurt. But on Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Haleys </ORGANIZATION>' bodies were found. Each had been shot at least twice. And Mrs. <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>'s body was found Wednesday, covered with leaves. The two suspects were in custody Saturday; bail for <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was set at $ 500,000 and Ms. <PERSON> Pfannenstiel </PERSON>'s at $ 200,000. Police said neither has a criminal record although <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s driver's license had been suspended since February and Ms. <PERSON> Pfannenstiel </PERSON> had a history of running away from home. The Haleys, both widowed, were married in 1975. Retirement for them meant visiting neighbors, socializing with friends and, for <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>, playing golf. `` They were the model of family life,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Erb </PERSON> said at the memorial service Friday at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` There was much more to them than their last few hours of life.'' The couple first met at the church, while it was being remodeled and members sat on folding chairs instead of pews. `` By the grace of God, they sat next to each other,'' <PERSON> Erb </PERSON> told the crowd of about 400 mourners. And on that fateful day when the congregation joined hands as a sign of peace, `` they held hands and they fell in love.''

<TEXT>
 Anti-communist rebels on Saturday claimed they shot down five Afghan government aircraft and killed or captured at least 40 soldiers during a week of fighting in northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> MIDIA </LOCATION>, a rebel-supported news organization, said insurgents downed three helicopter gunships last week as they were strafing rebel positions around <LOCATION> Maimana </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s northwestern <LOCATION> Faryab </LOCATION> province It said all of the people aboard the helicopters died but gave no death toll. Pakistan-based <ORGANIZATION> MIDIA </ORGANIZATION> said about 40 government soldiers were killed or captured. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MIDIA </ORGANIZATION> director, also said two fighter-bombers were shot down by rebel forces outside <LOCATION> Baghlan </LOCATION> city on the 200-mile <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> that is the supply line between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> said the two Soviet-supplied planes were downed by rebels who captured <PERSON> Hasantal </PERSON>, a town near <LOCATION> Baghlan </LOCATION>, 115 miles north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. He said the fighting in northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> belies President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s claims that rebel field commanders have made political deals with the Marxist government. `` <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> is claiming that fighting is just going on in the south and along the border, around <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, because of interference from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'' said <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON>. `` But the fighting in the north proves that it's not true and that the mujahedeen -LRB- rebels -RRB- have not reached any agreement with the government.'' The rebels, in 11 years of fighting successive Marxist governments, have been unable to capture a major city but control much of the countryside. There were predictions the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government would collapse after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> withdrew the last of its troops in February. The Soviets sent troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to help the government.

<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> left the hospital last week, he wore a red sweatshirt that proudly said, `` My wife gave me her heart and all her love. Now she gave me a kidney.'' <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> and his wife of 22 years, <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> `` Timmie'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> underwent a rare spouse-to-spouse transplant. <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, 46, gave one of her kidneys to her 47-year-old husband after becoming impatient with a shortage of available cadaver organs for transplant. The Nov. 29 operation was made possible by a rare match in the tissues of an unrelated living donor and recipient, doctors said. The couple is recovering well at their home in this <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb, physicians said. Two of their children, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON>, 12, and <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 15, are documenting their progress on home videos. `` Our big concern was that the kidney would function properly,'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> said. With anti-rejection drugs increasing the chance of survival for people receiving kidneys from donors who are not blood relatives, many doctors view spousal transplants as a way to shorten the wait for transplants. As of Monday, there were 280 people in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area on the waiting list for kidney transplants, according to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Regional Transplant Consortium. Most transplant organs come from cadavers. But fewer are available because of better care for people who a few years ago would have died from their injuries, said <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Light </PERSON>, chairman of transplantation at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Warners </ORGANIZATION> had their surgery. Of those who do die and are medically suitable for organ harvesting, only about 50 percent of their families give consent, compared with 83 percent two years ago. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> had those statistics to consider after both his kidneys failed in May. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, a maintenance supervisor for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, was given kidney dialysis treatments three times a week, but did n't want to stay on dialysis for the rest of his life. He decided he wanted a transplant kidney, and set Christmas as his personal deadline. The couple's oldest daughter, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, a 19-year-old college student, volunteered her kidney. But <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> recalled discussing a spousal organ transplant with a doctor. The <ORGANIZATION> Warners </ORGANIZATION> `` woke up on a Saturday morning and I said ` Why ca n't I give you a kidney?''' the secretary said. In a series of sophisticated tissue-typing tests to determine the kind of match <ORGANIZATION> Roseanne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s kidney would make with her husband's body, doctors determined that of the six tissue types, the couple matched on three. The chances of that happening between husband and wife are about one in 2,000, Light said.

 Waving banners and chanting `` inocente,'' supporters of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> rallied to his defense Saturday and raised funds to appeal the suspended <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> policeman's manslaughter conviction. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, speaking mostly in Spanish to a crowd of more than 300 in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> section, said he and fellow officers appreciate the outcry from the Hispanic community after a jury Thursday convicted him in the deaths of two black men. The incident provoked three days of inner-city rioting last January that left one man dead and more than $ 1 million in damage. `` We want a system of justice, not one of politics,'' the Colombian-born <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> said. His supporters have claimed that the <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury's decision was influenced by fear of another riot. Accompanied by his children and wife, who is also a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police officer, <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> said the verdict would have a chilling effect on law enforcement. `` Police now wonder if they shoot someone in the line of duty, will they be the next ones to go to jail,'' he told the rally at <ORGANIZATION> WOCN-AM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, which has joined other Spanish-language stations in raising money for an appeal. Later, <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> appeared with several hundred supporters at a rally in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, 31, is scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 24 on two counts of manslaughter for the deaths of motorcyclist <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> and his passenger, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> section. He faces up to 45 years. His attorneys say they will appeal. During the seven-week trial, broadcast live on local television and radio, defense attorneys claimed <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> shot in self-defense. Prosecutors alleged he could have avoided the motorcycle. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s black neighborhoods, the verdict was celebrated as a hallmark of justice. But along the main street of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, signs in English and Spanish read, `` <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> is 100 percent innocent'' and `` Where would you be without police?'' `` People are calling this justice, but that is impossible to believe,'' said <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Zoila </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>. `` Look at the people out here to say that a police officer may go to jail for doing his job.'' `` <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> is seen as a scapegoat in a system that is too worried about more violence from blacks,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, who joined the rally outside the station. `` There is a mentality among the Latins that a cop can do no wrong if he is out fighting bad guys.'' Nearby, motorists honked horns in support and dropped cash and checks into wastebaskets and hats bearing pro-Lozano bumper stickers. `` This is people's way of saying that justice has not been served,'' said <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s sister-in-law, <PERSON> Berta </PERSON>. Inside the station, a sign was posted with an address for a <LOCATION> Lozano </LOCATION> defense fund. A petition also was circulated calling for Dade Circuit Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> to allow <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> to remain free on bond until his appeal. There were no immediate estimates of how much money was raised Saturday. `` Cops are asking themselves now, ` What is right?''' said <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hispanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is not they way it should be.'' Police Chief <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said earlier that the city's legal department is reviewing <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s termination order, which could be issued this week. State law requires dismissal of any officer convicted of a felony.

 Leaders of a crippling weeklong strike of public workers declared victory Saturday after agreeing to end their walkout in exchange for a government pledge to seek loans to pay back wages. After meeting for an hour late Friday with union leaders, Prime Minister <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaize </PERSON> promised to convene <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday to seek its permission to request bank loans to pay workers $ 9.3 million in promised wages. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lauret </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarkson </PERSON> said Saturday that civil servants gained a `` great overwhelming victory'' in the dispute with <PERSON> Blaize </PERSON>. The strike idled about 7,000 public workers _ virtually all the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island's teachers and post office, port, customs, and other public employees. It began Dec. 1 after <PERSON> Blaize </PERSON> said he could not make the payments. The money represents unpaid wage increases from 1987 to 1989. <PERSON> Blaize </PERSON> said the funds were unavailable. Since 1987, the government has borrowed heavily from local banks to curb a growing budget deficit. The strike paralyzed virtually all government agencies, including key revenue earners such as customs, the treasury and the post office. It was widely believed <PERSON> Blaize </PERSON> had avoided reconvening Parliament for fear he would face a no-confidence vote, forcing him to resign. A split within the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in August left him with a minority.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> signed legislation Saturday banning assault weapons in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, saying he'd like to see greater gun control across <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and the nation. `` Semiautomatic assault-style weapons are designed for one purpose and one purpose only,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` They are designed to kill other human beings as fast as possible.'' The ban prohibits the sale of six military-style weapons, and requires anyone who already legally owns one to register it with the police commissioner. It also bans certain shotguns and rifles. `` This is a message to drug dealers and gangs bent on violence that we simply will not tolerate these weapons or the violence or destruction that they bring,'' the governor said at the signing ceremony at an inner-city police station. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Roache </PERSON> said the ban is not a panacea for <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s drug or gang problems, but is an important step in the community's response to violence. `` It's going to be a long and painful process until we fully come to the realization that we're the most violent society in the world and we have an attitude problem,'' <PERSON> Roache </PERSON> said. `` So we begin like this, one city changing laws and changing attitudes.'' The new law gives the commissioner power to place any firearm on the list of proscribed weapons for 30 days while a board, provided for in the legislation, decides whether to permanently add the gun to the list. The measure began as a home-rule petition from the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in the spring. The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> approved it late last month after a lengthy debate. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Yacino </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Gun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, described it as the toughest firearms regulation in the state, but maintains it will do nothing to stop the gang-related violence it targets. Gang - and drug-related slayings are rarely committed by licensed gun owners, <PERSON> Yacino </PERSON> argued, and more homicides are committed with handguns than assault weapons Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said tapping the community's outrage over violence turned the tide in the Legislature. `` We probably had more community meetings and discussions about lobbying state legislators for this legislation than any other,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. Lawmakers' offices were flooded with phone calls in support of the bill. `` It's not enough to do it just for <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, it's time we did it for all of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and all of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` These are weapons that belong on the battlefield, not in crack houses or in the neighborhoods.'' The law bans the sale or illegal posession of the AK-47 semiautomatic rifle; the Uzi semiautomatic rifle; the FN-FL semiautomatic rifle; the FN-FNC semiautomatic rifle; the <ORGANIZATION> Steyr </ORGANIZATION> Aug semi-automatic rifle; and the SKS semiautomatic rifle. It also bans all shotguns with revolving cylinders and semiautomatic rifles with fixed magazine capacities of more than 10 rounds, as well as modifications of any proscribed weapons. The first offense under the ban carries a $ 1,000 fine. Subsequent offenses carry penalties up to 2 -LCB- years in jail. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration imposed an import ban on assault-type rifles in July, but the ban did n't affect guns already owned by Americans or similar weapons produced by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in May became the first state to enact restrictions on the possession or sale of such guns. The law was prompted by the shooting of 35 people at a <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, schoolyard by a gunman with an AK-47. Cities and counties in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> also have enacted ordinances with certain restictions.

<TEXT>
 When a newspaper published a purported inventory of the governor's mansion _ including 156 chairs, six television sets and 26 sofas _ a miffed Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Lola </PERSON>, responded by proposing that the state sell off the place. Besides, his office says, there are a mere 113 chairs and 15 sofas. In a huff at what she called criticism of her family's lifestyle, Mrs. <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said Thursday that she and the governor will ask the 1990 <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to sell the mansion and its contents and donate the proceeds to help the homeless <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>'s spokesman, said Friday the attorney general's office was asked to determine if a sale of the 1910 mansion is possible. <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said Saturday he was still awaiting that ruling. Key lawmakers say they would oppose such a sale. Even if they were agreeable, the deed under which the mansion was donated to the state in 1965 stipulates the mansion be demolished if not in public use. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>'s chief of staff, says the Perpiches are aware that the mansion could face destruction if the property is sold. The dispute grew out of a story in Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> that included an inventory of items in the mansion and criticism from <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> about the Perpiches `` lavish lifestyle.'' Then, on Thursday, Mrs. <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> accused the newspaper and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans of waging a campaign to `` vilify'' her family and said she would ask the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Minneapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> to immediately remove all artwork and furniture on loan to the mansion. On Friday, <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> fueled his longstanding feud with the paper over coverage of his family by releasing an inventory of furnishings in the mansion. `` These figures differ dramatically from those published in your newspaper report,'' <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said in a letter to the editor. Mrs. <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> also said the newspaper had `` greatly inflated'' the amount of furniture in the residence. The article and an illustration indicated the mansion contained 156 chairs, 28 cabinets, 23 lamps, 83 artifacts, six television sets, 26 sofas, 81 tables, 16 rugs and seven mirrors. The article, quoting the Governor's <ORGANIZATION> Residence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, put the furnishings' value at $ 300,000 The inventory released Friday lists 113 chairs, six cabinets, 23 lamps, six television sets, 15 sofas, 59 tables, 12 rugs and six mirrors. In storage are 42 chairs, 11 sofas, 22 tables, four rugs and one mirror, many of them put aside because they are too worn out to use, <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said in the letter. The list did not give an estimate of worth. The renovation of the 20-room English Tudor mansion became a serious project after <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>'s 1982 election. Although Mrs. <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> originally said she would prefer living in a townhouse, not the mansion, she reconsidered under public pressure and began a campaign to raise private funds for renovation. Some $ 1.3 million has been raised for the mansion in the past 10 years, most of it since <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> took office. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabarski </PERSON>, chairman of the Governor's <ORGANIZATION> Residence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday that request to have artwork loaned to the mansion taken out would have to be made by the 15-member council, of which Mrs. <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> is a voting member, but not the only voting member. `` The loan agreement is an agreement that is held between the museums and the Governor's <ORGANIZATION> Residence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> itself, not the governor's residence,'' he said. The first time the Perpiches moved into the mansion was in late 1976 after <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>, then lieutenant governor, took over when then-Gov. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> resigned to fill <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s vacancy in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> The Perpiches moved out after he was defeated in his first race for governor in 1978.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> was afraid <PERSON> Lynell </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelenka </PERSON> might skip town before paying him the $ 12,000 in back rent he claims she owes. So he got a court order to seize her property _ including her pets, <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> the dog and <PERSON> Whitehill </PERSON> the cat. Especially her pets. `` They are just like my children and this is just like someone kidnapping my children and holding them hostage for ransom,'' said <PERSON> Zelenka </PERSON>, 31. `` I think I'll do anything they want.'' <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said he knew how much his tenant loved the animals, and that's why he took advantage of a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> statute that considers pets chattel. `` There's no intention to do anything that's going to hurt the dog and cat. I take a back seat to no one in liking animals,'' said Chambers. <PERSON> Zelenka </PERSON>, who claims she only owes $ 6,000 in back rent on her three-bedroom carriage house apartment, said the debt began piling up more than a year ago when she hurt her back. Chambers let the payments slide while <PERSON> Zelenka </PERSON> awaited the outcome of a lawsuit stemming from the injury. But <PERSON> Zelenka </PERSON> settled the lawsuit for less than she had hoped for and did n't tell her landlord, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said. When Chambers heard the lawsuit was over, he said he thought <PERSON> Zelenka </PERSON> might try to leave town and decided to take her pets. <PERSON> Zelenka </PERSON> came home Wednesday to find her car, furniture, books, hair dryer _ everything she owned but her personal papers and the stuff in the refrigerator _ gone. The note on her door said the <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> had taken her possessions and her pets. <PERSON> Zelenka </PERSON> rescued her pets from a veterinarian, but 20 minutes after she got them home, sheriff's deputies returned and confiscated them again. That time the dog and cat were taken to a pound. `` I asked if they could arrest me and leave the animals alone,'' she said, but the deputies refused. <PERSON> Zelenka </PERSON>, a court-document specialist, said she wants to pay Chambers what she can, but does n't have the money. She says she has a job in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, but ca n't move until her dog and cat are free. <PERSON> Iris </PERSON>, a 7-year-old <PERSON> Saluki </PERSON> `` with a face like the Lone Ranger,'' and <PERSON> Whitehill </PERSON>, an 11-year-old cat, are her best friends and consume her every thought, she said. `` At least I got her attention,'' said Chambers.

 Wintry storms brought snow and freezing rain to several Southeastern states, and scattered snow across the nation's northern tier Saturday Much of the Northeast remained in the grip of a cold spell. Sleet and freezing rain damaged trees and power lines in central <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, and an inch of ice covered roads between <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Irwinton </LOCATION>. Parts of northern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> were coated with up to 3 inches of snow by mid-afternoon, and there were reports of deeper snow in the mountains. Snow also was scattered over western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> at midday, with almost 6 inches covering <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> and 4 inches in <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>. Freezing rain and sleet extended over southeast <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and central <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Two days of snow and ice made roads treacherous in parts of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, officials said.

So the blue-lip brigade began their search for a new site.

 All this town of 2,000 wanted to do was correct a glaring ommission. The guest book at the 2-year-old welcome center had n't been signed by anyone from <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. So boosters in this southeastern town offered residents of the nation's second smallest state a free trip for the best 50-word essay on `` Why I want to visit <LOCATION> Davis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>.'' Nine members of the <ORGANIZATION> Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spent Saturday sifting through 182 entries. The winner was n't going to be announced until Sunday. The winner will receive plane fare from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> to nearby <LOCATION> Ottumwa </LOCATION>, three nights lodging, all meals, use of a new car, $ 15 for gasoline, a month's subscription to the <LOCATION> Ottumwa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courier </LOCATION>, a painting of the courthouse and free telephone calls home. Six <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> residents have signed the guest book at the <ORGANIZATION> Bloomfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> since the contest was announced, but the tourism organization decided to proceed with its plans anyway. Many of the essays were in rhyme and some were accompanied by photographs of the writer, but all were sincere about wanting to visit <LOCATION> Davis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. A few judges had a good laugh over an essay sent by a woman from <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>. `` At the risk of sounding corny _ This year my husband celebrates mid-life, my daughter graduates from high school -LRB- a diploma in one hand and my checkbook in the other -RRB-, and my son has reached puberty _ and you want to know why I would like to visit <LOCATION> Davis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>? Please _ take me!!!!'' the woman wrote. She added a postscript: `` I have n't seen $ 15 worth of gas since my daughter turned 16 _ and to use a phone without reservations _ bliss!'' Another essay that received high marks was in verse: `` <LOCATION> Davis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> I want to see another jewel in this land of the free giving this gift of education is a great way to spend a three-day vacation We share similar goals from region to region but we all suffer from tunnel vision The optimal cure for this dreaded disease is my answering your ad and you choosing me.''

 A state board recommended no disciplinary action against four psychologists who speculated about why <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> drank rubbing alcohol. The <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Registration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychologists </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Friday that it ended its investigation after finding that the counselors provided satisfactory explanations for their comments. The board, whose members are appointed by Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said the psychologists had not violated ethical principles by commenting on the governor's wife without being directly involved in her case. In a Nov. 10 story in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>, psychologists <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dym </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kantor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carolynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Maltas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared to suffer from a common problem in which one partner in a marriage breaks down because he or she carries all the emotional burdens of the relationship. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that in the wake of the inquiry, she hoped to develop new guidelines on how psychologists should talk to reporters. The board's principles currently state that psychologists have a duty not to violate anyone's civil rights and to avoid `` misrepresentation through sensationalism'' and `` superficiality.'' `` One of the things I was concerned about was that there would be a terrible chilling effect,'' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said. `` I want us to figure out how to be accessible as possible as a field, because public education about emotional matters is as important a service as psychologists can serve.'' Part of the problem, <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said, was that a therapist's comments about common behavior patterns could be mistakenly interpreted as a clinical diagnosis Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has a history of depression and substance abuse, was hospitalized Nov. 6 after drinking a small amount of rubbing alcohol. She has since been released and has appeared in public several times.

 A 15-year-old girl testified that she was raped by three crew members for LL Cool J while as many as eight members of the rap singer's band stood by watching. The girl, who said she never saw LL Cool J, said the singer's bodyguard lured her to his hotel room in suburban <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> with promises of meeting the star and then began sexually assaulting her there She testified in <LOCATION> Hennepin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> Friday at the opening of the trial of bodyguard <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsipouras </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tsipouras </LOCATION> is charged with two counts of first-degree sexual assault stemming from the alleged attack Aug. 10 following a concert by the popular rap band at Metropolitan Sports Center in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>. The girl testified that she and a 16-year-old friend had won tickets and backstage passes to the Aug. 9 concert from a radio station. But when it was time to go backstage, the station's representative was late Tsipouras then stepped in with an offer to meet LL Cool J, she testified. The two girls were driven by limousine to the hotel, then taken to <PERSON> Tsipouras </PERSON>' room, she said. The girl testified that another crew member left the room upon learning that she was 15. She said <PERSON> Tsipouras </PERSON> asked her to come into the bathroom to talk. Once inside, she said, he closed the door and sexually assaulted her twice. The teen-ager, who said she had never had sex before, said she was too fearful, embarrassed and humiliated to act assertively. She also testified that crew members <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> assaulted her later while six to eight men came into the bathroom and watched, some of them standing in the shower. `` They were all watching,'' she said. `` They were saying, ` When am I going to get mine.'

 Communists are likely to lose power in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> in local elections Sunday, according to polls taken in the Baltic republics. `` The past comes to an end today,'' the grassroots pro-democracy <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> proclaimed in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> in an pre-election appeal asking voters to wrest power from the Communists. Results will be carefully watched in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, since the two Soviet republics are the first of 15 to hold elections for municipal councils under new rules allowing voters a choice of candidates. The vote also coincides with rising debate over the role of Communists. On Saturday, the national party's chief ideologue, <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, said the party is willing to surrender its constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power. On Thursday, the legislature of the third Baltic republic, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, voted to revoke the constitutional clause guaranteeing Communist supremacy in society and political life. In <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, more than 9,000 candidates are vying to fill 4,200 seats in city and rural councils throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s least populous republic with 1.6 million inhabitants Polls show the most popular candidates are environmentalists, or Greens, with ethnic Estonians favoring the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the Russians favoring workers' associations with close links to Communists. `` But if both ethnic and non-ethnic Estonians are considered, our opinion polls indicate 50 percent support for the <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> _ by far the best support. The Communists would get under 10 percent,'' said <PERSON> Juhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kivirahk </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. He predicted that power in the Estonian capital of <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> would shift from Communists to an electoral union of 10 groups, including environmentalists and the <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Non-Communists are running on platforms ranging from environmental protection and economic reform to total independence for this Baltic state, which was absorbed into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> through a 1939 pact with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. A subtle issue only quietly discussed is the tension between ethnic Estonians and immigrants, mainly Russians, comprising about 40 percent of the republic's population. `` I can not openly declare that I am anti-Russian, but every Estonian knows which candidate is against the Russians,'' <PERSON> Ain </PERSON> <PERSON> Roopson </PERSON>, an independent candidate, said in an interview. In October, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s parliament under <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> pressure abandoned an attempt to impose residency requirements for voters, but it retained the requirement that a candidate in the election must have lived in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> for at least two years. In <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Imans </PERSON> <PERSON> Daudis </PERSON>, a secretary of the top government executive body, the Presidium, called Sunday's vote `` the first election conducted in the situation of real political pluralism.'' Only 34 percent of the candidates in the republic of more than 2.5 million people are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, while 32 percent are members of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. In March elections for the new Soviet parliament, People's Front candidates trounced party-backed candidates in races across all three Baltic states.

Only one body has been recovered _ that of a crewman from the 60-foot fishing trawler <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> and Sisters II of <LOCATION> Shelburne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Novia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>, that sank Friday night with eight men aboard. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, a search and rescue spokesman in <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION>, said the <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> and Sisters II disappeared about 150 miles south of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Race </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>. Maritime officials said a crewman aboard the Japanese fishing trawler <PERSON> Kinei </PERSON> <PERSON> Maru </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> died of head injuries suffered when the 135-foot boat was pummeled by howling winds and two-story-high waves. They said the <ORGANIZATION> Kinei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maru </ORGANIZATION>, which was about 450 miles south of <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION>, radioed that another crewman also was injured but the vessel was too far away to be reached by helicopter. The search was scaled down Saturday night for 39 seamen from two cargo ships that disappeared in raging seas in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> on Thursday night. Search vessels and aircraft braved the storm Friday and Saturday but found no bodies from the 400-foot Capitaine <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> or the 270-foot <PERSON> Johanna </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. When radio contact was lost, the two cargo ships were about 120 miles apart north of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Breton </LOCATION>. Coast guard officials said a lifeboat from the <PERSON> Johanna </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON> was found floating upside down. The Panamanian-registered <PERSON> Johanna </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON> had a crew of 16, all Filipinos, an agent for the ship reported. The <PERSON> Captaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, with 23 men aboard, was owned by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> company and officials said the crew included French, Fijian, Dutch, Filipino and <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION> seamen. Maritime officials said the storm, with winds gusting up to 96 mph, also stranded two ferries bound for <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>. They said the Sir <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, with 51 passengers, has been anchored since Thursday evening off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Smoky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>, about 30 miles from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, and winds were too strong for the ferry to return to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>. The officials said the ferry Caribou was anchored in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> and had been there since Friday. They said they did now know how many people were aboard. A fishing trawler with a crew of 33 Koreans sank off <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> in November 1987, drowning all aboard. In one of the worst accidents off <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, 84 people perished when the Ocean Ranger oil rig tipped over and sank in February 1982.

 Soldiers loyal to European mercenaries who seized power in this island nation used tear gas Saturday to block a rally by hundreds of protesters angry about the coup. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it was preparing to evacuate French citizens from the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> islands if necessary, but it denied planning a military intervention of the former <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> colony. Foreign diplomats have accused the mercenaries' leader, Frenchman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Denard </PERSON>, of ordering or carrying out the Nov. 26 assassination of President <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON>. There has been previous spontaneous protests against <PERSON> Denard </PERSON>, but Saturday's demonstration would have been the first planned in advance. However, soldiers from the Presidential Guard, which is commanded by the mercenaries, dispersed the crowd at <LOCATION> Moroni </LOCATION>'s central mosque before the protest could begin There were no reports of arrests or injuries. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the biggest donors to the islands off the African coast near <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, both have cut off aid since the assassination. They are pressuring <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> to leave. <PERSON> Denard </PERSON>, 60, denies any role in <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON>'s death and insists he will not be forced from the islands. The 30 mercenaries, all <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> or Belgian, on Thursday expelled 11 foreign journalists from the islands, accusing them of inciting protests. The same day, the Presidential Guard used tear gas and clubs to disperse an anti-Denard protest by hundreds of youths, and some protesters were arrested. On Friday, the acting president, <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Djohar </PERSON>, said in a radio broadcast that no political meetings should be held. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied reports that a commando force had been dispatched to <PERSON> Mayotte </PERSON>, an island in the Comoro archipelago that remained French when the other islands became independent in 1975. `` There's been no commandos sent to the Comoros,'' the spokesman said. However, he said reinforcements had been sent to the French island of Reunion, also in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, in case evacuation of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> citizens becomes necessary, `` without any intention of intervening in the Comoros.'' <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> led a 1975 coup that ousted <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON>. In 1978, with the blessing of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Denard </PERSON> led another coup, returning <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> to power.

 Tiny <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was recovering well Saturday after undergoing the nation's second living-donor liver transplant, but the 15-month-old faces a tougher battle recuperating in the next few weeks, hospital officials said. <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON> remained in critical but stable condition Saturday evening, the day after doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> removed the left lobe of 20-year-old father <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' liver and implanted it in the infant <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' condition was upgraded from critical but stable to serious but stable. <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON>'s response since the 7 -LCB- - hour operation was completed just after 10:30 p.m. Friday `` has been literally outstanding,'' hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fetsch </PERSON> said Saturday She said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> `` also came back out of surgery just remarkably well.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a dry-wall installer from the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, area, could be moved from the intensive care unit by Sunday, Ms. <PERSON> Fetsch </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> Broelsch </PERSON>, the transplant surgeon who performed the operation, said the surgery was `` very difficult,'' in part because doctors had to remove signs of a bacterial infection from the child. They worried it could linger and infect the new organ. Ms. Fetch said doctors will closely monitor <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON> during the next 24 to 48 hours for signs of infection or other complications. `` After that, the next hurdle she'll have to overcome is within the next seven to 10 days when any signs of rejection of the new liver would begin to show up,'' Ms. <PERSON> Fetsch </PERSON> said. If she overcomes those two hurdles, the spokeswoman said, `` the next step is to get her out of the hospital, and that could be anywhere from four to eight weeks from now.'' `` And once we get her to that point we feel that the next hurdle she has to overcome is the one-year to three-year mark _ where she does n't experience any rejection or complications,'' Ms. <PERSON> Fetsch </PERSON> said. `` And then we feel like she'll be pretty much home free for the rest of her life.'' Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitington </PERSON>, director of pediatric transplant services at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said doctors also want to see the youngster gain weight. He said earlier in the week that <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON> was `` every bit as malnourished as an Ethiopian refugee'' because of her condition and infection. <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON> has suffered since birth from a usually fatal disorder called biliary atresia. The congenital disorder also afflicted 21-month-old <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who on Nov. 27 received part of her mother's liver at U of C in the first living-donor liver transplant in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Schertz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, was in serious but stable condition Saturday evening, with her liver function `` rapidly improving toward normal'' and no signs of her body rejecting the transplant, Ms. <PERSON> Fetsch </PERSON> said. Her mother, <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a 29-year-old schoolteacher, was released from the hospital Thursday on the arm of her husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. The couple planned to visit their daughter during her recovery, and were staying at a nearby <ORGANIZATION> Ronald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a place for families of children hospitalized away from home.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> is investigating a report that a structural engineer was fired after concluding that an earthquake could cause the walls to collapse at the department's Y-12 nuclear weapons plant, a DOE official confirmed Saturday. The engineer, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nestel </PERSON>, says other engineers then rewrote his study to say the walls of the Oak Ridge plant were sturdy enough. The revised report was based on `` spurious calculations that would be obvious to any engineer with earthquake experience,'' <PERSON> Nestel </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. He called the nuclear plant, built near the end of World War II, an example of `` Third World construction.'' <PERSON> Nestel </PERSON> was recruited in July by <ORGANIZATION> Lockwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> to conduct the earthquake study for <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the Oak Ridge plant for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. `` I can not comment on the study because it is still being drafted,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON>, a spokesman for the DOE facilities. `` I can not comment on Mr. <PERSON> Nestel </PERSON> because he is not a DOE employee. `` What I can comment on is that we are looking into the matter.'' <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said a two-person internal panel has been appointed to review the case beginning next week. The review should take about a week, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Nestel </ORGANIZATION> reported Sept. 25 that the unreinforced clay tile walls of the main building of the Y-12 plant would give way if struck by an earthquake with a lateral force of .12 percent of gravity, well below the .19 percent used nationwide as the `` design basis'' for quake vulnerability studies. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district was heavily damaged in the October earthquake by a force of .15 percent, <PERSON> Nestel </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nestel </PERSON>, a Californian, said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> fault `` altered the course of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>'' when it last slipped early in the 19th century. The earthquake created <LOCATION> Reelfoot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. `` If it slipped again, it would certainly destroy those walls,'' he said. Although Oak Ridge is in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and the fault is several hundred miles west, the shock of eastern earthquakes is spread over a wider area. By Oct. 30, <PERSON> Nestel </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, engineers with <PERSON> Lockwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> had met to discuss his findings. He said they then reported to DOE that the walls `` have the capacity to withstand the design-basis earthquake.'' <PERSON> Nestel </PERSON> was fired Nov. 3. <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said the DOE review into <ORGANIZATION> Nestel </ORGANIZATION>'s allegations would include the circumstances of his firing and the report itself. `` We're bringing in one individual on the panel who has a knowledge of seismic studies to take an independent look at the whole affair,'' <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said. `` We ca n't make any judgments until we've reviewed all the facts of the matter.''

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leadership Saturday he is ready to modify or abandon the party's constitutional monopoly on power but only as part of sweeping political reforms `` In the framework of this process, any article -LRB- of the constitution -RRB- can be the subject of modification or be excluded. This fully refers as well to Article 6,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting. Article 6 in the 1977 constitution makes the 20-million-member Communist Party `` the leading light and guiding force'' in Soviet society. The debate over the party's role reflects the reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has dropped the word `` Communist'' from the party's name and is preparing for multiparty elections, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has installed a non-Communist prime minister and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have repealed the Communists' monopoly on power. On Thursday, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> became the first of the 15 constituent Soviet republics to drop a constitutional guarantee of Communist power and approve a multiparty system. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting was to prepare for the new session of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, the national parliament, that convenes Tuesday. Human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and several other members of parliament have called for a brief general strike Monday to show support for removing the constitutional clause assuring the Communist Party of power. <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, the party's chief ideologue, said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s call for a strike violates the ethical standards of a legislator in view of parliament's appeal to refrain from strikes that could deepen the country's economic crisis <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in a clear reference to <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, said those demanding the urgent revocation of Article 6 were trying to `` demoralize Communists, lower their activity at a turning point in perestroika'' _ his program for restructuring the Soviet economy and society. `` We must not create a new constitution until we have more or less clearly defined the contours of the renewed social mechanism, the optimal structure of organs of power and adminstration, the order of interaction of political forces,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, according to a text provided by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. The 58-year-old leader used the phrase `` political forces'' instead of political parties, but he clearly was referring to a role for groups not controlled by the Communists. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called for patience in rewriting the constitution. `` Comrades, let's not forget that this is already the fifth constitution under Soviet power,'' he said. `` This time let's try to create a law that country can live with for a long time.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> opposes a reassessment of the party's constitutional guarantees until preparations begin for a nationwide party congress in October 1990 `` There is no need to speed up this process now,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s effort to raise the issue in parliament. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the 250-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> agreed with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on what parliament should discuss. In other developments at the committee session: _ <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, speaking at a news conference at the end of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s perestroika program was criticized during the 10-hour meeting by `` conservative and dogmatic'' speakers. _ He said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not come under personal attack, and he attributed the argments over reform to `` the exacerbated situation in the country and the need for fast progress.'' _ The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> endorsed a program to revive the faltering state-run economy and to prepare the 13th Five-Year Plan for 1991-95. _ It elevated the new party chief of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivashko </PERSON>, to membership on the ruling Politburo. It also named the recently appointed editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>, to the Secretariat, which handles the day-to-day running of party business. Echoing a policy announced more than a year ago by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said the party's goal is to `` move away from being the guiding nucleus of the whole government structure to becoming a political vanguard.'' For more than seven decades, the party has dictated everything from the direction of Soviet foreign policy to how much collective farms should produce and how much state stores charge for a bar of soap. <PERSON> Ivashko </PERSON>, 57, became the 12th member of the Politburo, succeeding Ukrainian party boss <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON>, who was retired at the last <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plenary meeting in September. The new party chiefs in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, the country's largest cities, were not given Politburo seats in contrast to the usual practice But <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> chief <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidaspov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> were named to the new 16-member party bureau for the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> federation, which will be headed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and provide a separate party leadership for the country's largest republic. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, a Politburo member, indicated the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would not try to stop the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> from declaring independence from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> at a congress opening Dec. 18. `` There are no problems that our party can fail to cope with,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will meet again in January to lay the groundwork for the 28th party congress in October that is empowered to change the party's policies and guidelines.

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> apologized Saturday for leading the country into crisis and overwhelmingly elected as its new chief <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>, a 41-year-old reformer known for defending the rights of the opposition. <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> promised that the Communists are willing to enter into a government coalition with other parties after free elections proposed for May. He also said the party is abandoning its claim to absolute rule and held up a huge janitor's broom, symbolizing his determination to make a clean sweep and start anew. <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>, 41, a bespectacled, blunt-talking intellectual, is the youngest <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He was chosen during a 17-hour emergency party congress that started Friday night. After the election, reformist Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> set up a commission to study an overhaul of the nation's increasingly troubled economy, plagued by slow growth, consumer product shortages and a foreign debt of $ 20.6 billion. <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> called the party's problems `` insanely complicated,'' despite promises of new ideas, new personnel and more democratic ideas. The party chairman also cautioned the more than 2,700 delegates at the party congress that there `` are n't any miracles.'' Miracles may be what is needed for the Communists, who were holding what almost certainly will be their last session as the country's ruling force. Party officials disclosed Tuesday that 500,000 members had quit since September, more than twice the previously published figure. That brings the membership to less than 1.8 million, seriously weakening the force that held an iron-fisted sway over <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for four decades. The Communists also have lost their monopoly on power in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, where formation of the first government not dominated by Communists was announced Saturday. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leadership he is ready to modify or abandon the party's constitutional monopoly on power but only as part of sweeping political reforms With seven former Politburo members in jail and some ousted leaders charged with corruption, the East German Communists squarely faced up to the abuses of the past. The first section of a report approved by the delegates issued an apology, saying the former leadership `` had led our country into this crisis threatening its existence.'' `` We are willing to make amends,'' the report said. The delegates decided to change the party's name later this week but voted against disbanding altogether. They also voted to streamline the leadership. <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s most prominent lawyers, infuriated hard-line rulers in October by representing the New Forum opposition group in its bid to become a legal organization. After weeks of trying amid growing tumult, the 200,000-strong New Forum gained legal recognition needed to avoid official suppression. After his election, <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> pledged to work for democratic socialism, a term that has become increasingly popular among the country's reformers, both within the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and outside it. He said the Communists would be `` one party among others.'' He pledged to continue the break with the abuses of hard-line Stalinism but also said the country has no intention of adopting capitalism, and he repeated his opposition to reunification of the Germanys. More than 6,000 people, some of them East Germans, took part in a demonstration late Saturday in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to protest growing calls for reunification. Several West German politicians reacted skeptically to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> meeting. <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruehe </PERSON>, the general secretary of Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON>, repeated his assertion that the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has failed despite the new chairman. The Communists have lost much of their control in recent weeks and have granted historic concessions to the opposition, including opening the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and other borders, in a desperate effort to remain in power. Long-time party leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was ousted from power Oct. 18 as tens of thousands of East Germans fled West and thousands more took to the streets to demand democratic reforms. He is now under house arrest and charged with corruption and abuse of power. <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> took over from <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and introduced reforms, such as opening the borders, but his long-time association with the <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> regime forced his ouster last week. The 10-member Politburo and 163-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> resigned at the same time, and a 25-member panel of reformers was named to run party affairs until the weekend congress. <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>, whose father is Jewish, served until last year as the state secretary for religious affairs, a high-ranking post. Party spokeswoman <PERSON> Brigitte </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON>, briefing reporters on the closed session of the emergency congress, said <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> was the only candidate to become the party's third leader in less than two months. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said 95.3 percent of the 2,714 delegates participating voted for <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> in balloting that took 5 -LCB- hours. In a secret ballot, delegates also chose other members in a new 100-member party leadership over which <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> will preside. <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> has backed sweeping political and economic reforms. He was a member of the interim party leadership and is heading a committee investigating corruption under the ousted leadership. <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> is an avid supporter of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s glasnost policy of a more open and free society. At a Nov. 4 rally of about 1 million in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Platz </PERSON>, a large square in the city center, <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> said that `` glasnost belongs in the German vocabulary.''

 About 600 people returned to their homes in this south-central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> village Saturday after workers repaired a ruptured pipeline that spawned a huge propane gas cloud. Residents were evacuated and electricity and gas were turned off Friday to prevent any possibility of igniting the 15-acre cloud of gas that leaked from the <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> 66 pipeline, firefighter <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Moroney </PERSON> said. Gas and electrical power were turned back on Saturday. `` We are returning somewhat to normalcy,'' <PERSON> Moroney </PERSON> said. A farmer broke the pipe while cutting through a field with a plow, <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputies said. `` I was working on a hill that overlooks that area,'' said farmer <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Faller </PERSON>, 38. `` I saw a huge cloud starting to appear, very low to the ground, very dense.'' Officials evacuated a six-mile area around <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> about 5 p.m. Friday as a precaution. <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> employees worked overnight to repair the line, and most of the gas had dispersed by sunrise, <PERSON> Moroney </PERSON> said. The propane pipeline runs from <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> in central Illinoi to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. It runs about a mile northwest of <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, which is about 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. Police and fire officials allowed residents back into their homes shortly after 7 a.m. Saturday after firefighters and hazardous materials experts from the state police checked homes for gas, state police Sgt. <PERSON> Lyndall </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyen </PERSON> said. There were no injuries.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday it will launch a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 rocket Sunday with a military navigation satellite, taking priority over the flight of a commercial Titan 3 booster with two foreign satellites. The Titan 3 liftoff was postponed Thursday night by a computer software problem and Friday night by stormy weather. The launch was to mark the entry of <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> into the commercial launch business. Company officials said Saturday that other launches planned at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> over the next nine days have priority, so the Titan 3 ca n't be launched until at least Dec. 20. However, they said if one of the other rockets is delayed, the Titan 3 could move up. The rocket is to carry communications satellites for a Japanese company and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>. The Delta launch from another pad was set for 12:58 p.m. EST with the launch window extending until 1:19 p.m. The rocket carries the fourth in a series of Navstar satellites that enable <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and allied military forces to pinpoint their location anywhere on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> within 50 feet. Other pending launches are those of a Trident 2 military missile from the submarine USS Tennessee during the coming week and space shuttle <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> on Dec. 18. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s five astronauts are to deploy a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> communications satellite and then track down and retrieve for return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> a science payload that has been orbiting the globe for nearly six years.

 Premier <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON> and opposition leaders agreed Saturday to form the first government in more than four decades not dominated by Communists. <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON> made the announcement shortly after President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, the last hard-line Communist in a position of power, announced he will resign as soon as the new government is installed. The premier said the government will be sworn in Sunday and will have 10 Communists, including <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON> himself, and 11 non-Communists _ two members each from the small <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> parties and seven ministers with no political affiliation. The Socialists and People's parties were formerly docile Communist allies but have helped the pro-reform movement by playing an increasingly independent role. Speaking on national television, <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON> said the Communists and opposition representatives decided on the `` government of national understanding'' after a `` very difficult'' day of bargaining. He did not say how the portfolios would be distributed. Opposition leader <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, speaking after <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON>, declared the opposition satisfied with the outcome of two days of `` round-table'' negotiations that ended late Saturday. `` It was the maximum that could have been achieved at a given moment under these conditions,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said. He described the negotiations as `` very intensive, tiring and complicated.'' However, the opposition was in buoyant spirits when its delegation returned to cheers, claps and kisses from workers at its central <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> headquarters. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> flashed a V-for-victory sign as he dashed into a closed-door meeting, which opened with greetings from Polish Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. `` This is 99 percent of my wishes come true,'' said composer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kocab </PERSON>, who was in the opposition delegation that negotiated with <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON>. `` The other 1 percent would be <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> for president.'' The peaceful revolution here follows similar reforms in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, the talks on the government were the second attempt in a week to create a government acceptable to the opposition, which has staged a stunningly successful pro-democracy campaign. The Communists agreed Nov. 28 to give up their party's 41-year monopoly on power. Communist Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> then named a Cabinet that gave non-Communists only five of the 21 seats and left Communists controlling all key posts. The opposition threatened a nationwide general strike if a new Cabinet with more non-Communists was not named by Dec. 10. Hundreds of thousands of people staged rallies in support of the demand. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> resigned and was replaced by <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON>, a dissident lawyer who heads the opposition group <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violence </ORGANIZATION>, said he hoped new elections could be held soon. <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON> is among the opposition activists named for inclusion in the new government, possibly as a deputy premier. Reform-minded <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Valtr </PERSON> <PERSON> Komarek </PERSON> also has the backing of the opposition. <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> will swear in the ministers as his last official act. The 76-year-old president was one of the hard-liners put into power after <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> tanks crushed the 1968 `` Prague Spring'' reform movement. The others, including party chief <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, have been ousted in the last month. `` Right after the naming of the new government, I will resign ... to make further development easier,'' said <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, who has held the largely ceremonial job since 1975. <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> had been the focus of many anti-government demonstrations, and the opposition had demanded he quit by Sunday. His resignation will mark the end of two decades of strict Communist rule in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> that began after the 1968 invasion that crushed <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s reforms. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was dumped as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader and replaced by <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, who served from 1969 until his replacement by <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> in 1987. <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> remained president, and his present five-year term had been set to expire in May 1990. The five <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations that took part in the 1968 invasion have since condemned the action. <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> alluded to recent criticism of the post-1968 crackdown, allowing that there were some `` bad things.'' But he stuck fast to his lifelong belief in the socialist system. `` Whatever mistakes occurred were the mistakes of people and not of fundamental ideas,'' he said, welcoming what he called the `` renaissance'' of socialism under way in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday chose a reformer, <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>, as its new chief and apologized for mistakes of the past that led the country into crisis. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leadership he is ready to modify or abandon the party's constitutional monopoly on power, but only as part of sweeping political reforms The Czechoslovak opposition won yet another concession Saturday with the announcement by Interior Minister <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinc </PERSON> that authority over all police, including counterintelligence and secret police, will pass from the ministry to more direct government control. <PERSON> Pinc </PERSON> also apologized to students who were beaten by riot police on Nov. 17. The attacks on peaceful protesters sparked the pro-democracy movement. `` Nothing like this will happen again,'' <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Pinc </PERSON> as saying. `` We fully support the creation of a truly democratic society.''

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters of every religion believe a Roman Catholic bishop was wrong to bar a state Assemblywoman who supports abortion rights from taking Communion, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll. The bishop's action was seen as inappropriate by 71 percent of registered voters surveyed in the poll, including 71 percent of Catholics and 70 percent of Protestants, the newspaper reported Saturday. <PERSON> Assemblywoman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Killea </PERSON> was in the midst of a bitterly contested race in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> for the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last month when <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> ordered her not to take Communion unless she recanted her abortion views. <PERSON> Killea </PERSON>, a Democrat who had been seen as an underdog in the race against Republican <PERSON> Assemblywoman </PERSON> <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, won a narrow victory Tuesday. <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> said the bishop's sanction propelled her opponent to victory. `` Although religion has always played an important part in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politics, this survey reaffirms that a majority of voters are likely to resent attempts by the church to influence the outcome of political contests,'' Times Poll Director I.A. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. The Times polled 2,046 adults, including 1,594 registered voters, over a five-day period last week, the newspaper said. Among other findings: _ A majority of people who are against abortion _ 52 percent _ felt <PERSON> Maher </PERSON>'s action was wrong. _ A majority of Californians support a woman's right to abortion. Fifty-four percent of all those polled were in favor of abortion, 36 percent were opposed and 10 percent were undecided. _ Among <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Catholics, those registered to vote favored abortion by a 5-4 margin, while those not registered opposed it 7-5. The newspaper said the survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to send two high-level emissaries to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, in hopes of normalizing relations, will not mean the lifting of sanctions imposed after <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s crackdown on pro-democracy movements last June, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Saturday <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the unannounced trip by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> and Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> was an exception to formal policy that bars high-level talks with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. He said political and economic sanctions <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> invoked after troops brutally suppressed pro-democracy movements will remain in place for the time being. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, speaking at a dinner held by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said, `` We come to reduce the negative influence of irritants in the relationship.'' Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Affairs subcommittee on <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> affairs, criticized the sudden trip. `` I thought it was another example of the administration's unfortunate tendency to kow-tow to the Chinese,'' <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said `` It also struck me as a repudiation of the president's own policy of suspending all high-level contacts with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> pending an improvement in the human rights situation in that country.'' Last spring, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> liaison to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, was criticized for not reacting strongly and quickly enough to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s harsh repression of political dissent <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the trip was chiefly intended to brief the Chinese on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s summit last week in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> felt in addition that `` we should take this opportunity'' to also begin `` exploring ways of resuming relations'' in the aftermath of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s brutal crackdown last June on pro-democracy demonstrations, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The trip, which was n't announced by the White House until the two men arrived in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> at 1 a.m. EST Saturday, is an exception to formal policy, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Similar exceptions were made when Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> met with the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> foreign minister in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and again in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, he added. Asked about the unusual middle-of-the-night announcement, well after most newspapers' deadlines, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> denied any intended secrecy. He noted it was not customary to announce such briefing trips and said the Chinese had asked that it not be disclosed until the two men had arrived. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he did not know why <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> wanted the meeting kept quiet. In June, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed the administration's displeasure with the violent suppression of the pro-democracy demonstrations by imposing several economic and political sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Those sanctions suspended all military and commercial weapons sales to the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation. Additionally, visits between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military leaders were halted and visa extensions for about 40,000 Chinese students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were given `` sympathetic review'' by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're not forgetting what happened,'' when the tanks rolled through Tiananmen Square, the site of rallies by hundreds of thousands of Chinese, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said of keeping the sanctions in place. However, he said, `` As a world participant, we have to be in the position of having some contacts and relations with them over the long term. `` We needed to at least start the process of having contacts and some normalization of relations with the Chinese.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> would `` raise issues of human rights and political rights'' in his talks with Chinese leaders, but declined to discuss to what extent Scowcroft would tie those issues to resumption of normal relations. `` We want to start down that road because <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is a major world participant,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The presidential spokesman said the American representatives would be discussing the reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, as well as the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> talks. The two officials will return Dec. 11 after stopping in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to also brief that nation's leaders on the summit. In the statement released by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> early Saturday, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president still `` deplores'' the tragedy of Tiananmen Square. When the crackdown first began last June, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> initially refrained from harshly condemning the Chinese actions, but then he announced a series of sanctions designed to show <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> disapproval. In recent weeks, administration officials have said little about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no comment when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, who is a symbol of opposition to Chinese repression. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last month vetoed the annual <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> authorization bill, including expanded sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

 Chinese students marked the 54th anniversary of a student uprising Saturday with official functions stressing loyalty to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the socialist system. The official media reported that art festivals, symposiums and performances were held around the country to commmemorate the `` Dec. 9th'' movement of 1935 when <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> students took to the streets to protest Japanese aggression in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. As with other anniversaries of historic student movements, the government moved to preempt any student activism by holding events in which the emphasis was on obedience rather than resistance. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ximing </PERSON>, party chief in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and a member of the Politburo, told a symposium that college students should `` take the social responsibility to devote themselves to the socialist cause,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. It quoted one student from the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a center of activism during the pro-democracy demonstrations this year, as saying that students had begun to turn to the works of <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> because after the political turmoil they realized their theoretical level was low. But it also noted that another student commented that the Dec. 9th Movement anniversary was different this year because `` students were more calm and thoughtful rather than being full of experience.'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> reported that at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> an audience of 1,000 gave warm applause to 100 students singing, `` The east is red, the sun is rising, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has brought forth a Mao Tse-tung.'' The Youth News said that in the central city of <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION>, the play `` We and the Motherland'' was staged and the teaching of revolutionary tradition and patriotism was carried out. In the <LOCATION> Shandong </LOCATION> provincial capital of <LOCATION> Jinan </LOCATION>, the daily said, students at a symposium pledged to follow the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and integrate themselves with workers and peasants. Student dissent was effectively silenced by the violent military takeover of student-held <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> on June 3-4, and the vast majority of students, wishing to avoid repercussions, are carefully mouthing the party line. Privately, however, some students say the harsh political repression since June has only hardened their resentment toward the government and their convictions that the intransigence of the current leadership will only lead to further conflict.

 President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> condemned the superpowers Saturday on the eve of a Central American summit, saying they talk of peace while supporting military solutions. He appealed to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to help end the region's civil wars. Five Central American presidents will begin a two-day summit Sunday, trying to rescue their shredded regional peace plan to end armed conflicts in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> did not mention the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by name, but spoke of `` superpowers in and out of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> continent that are two-faced, talking about political solutions while they encourage military offensives.'' Diplomats expressed doubt the summit would get the peace process back on track. `` Only a miracle would produce an agreement,'' said a Central American diplomat who helped arrange the meeting. `` I do not see a solution to the political crisis.'' Guatemalan President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> said Saturday, `` We are going through a very difficult moment. We are not very optimistic, but it is a question of being willing to do something about it.'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said the recent offensive by leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> `` eliminated whatever political space had opened there for the opposition ... There is a polarization there that will be very difficult to eliminate.'' The summit, the latest in a series of gatherings aimed at working out a regional peace, had been scheduled for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. It was moved from <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> after Salvadoran President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> suspended diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, accusing it of supplying surface-to-air missiles to the Salvadoran rebels. A summit conference Aug. 7 in <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, resulted in a surge of optimism as <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> agreed to hold elections, the Salvadorans agreed to talk to their guerrilla opponents, and all five presidents agreed that U.S.-supported Contra guerrillas should be demobilized by Dec. 5. But hopes fell in the last six weeks. Fighting surged inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as Contra rebels mounted attacks and President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> declared an end to a 19-month cease-fire. In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas launched their biggest attack of the war. The deadline for Contra demobilization passed with the Contras still in their camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> massing along the border. The fifth president to attend the summit is <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. An important actor in the Central American drama _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ does not attend the regional meetings but does try to influence decisions. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s government economically and militarily and provides non-lethal support to the Nicaraguan rebels. Honduran president-elect <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Callejas </PERSON>, who takes office Jan. 27, has said that his nation, like <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, needs peace to attract investment and spur an economic recovery. There has been virtually no new foreign investment in his nation in years. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> wants the Contras _ those inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and those living and training on the Honduran side of the border _ disarmed and disbanded. The government has offered an amnesty program. But Contra military leaders, with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing, want to keep their groups together as a viable force until after Feb. 25 elections are held in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to keep pressure on the Sandinistas to hold a fair vote. The slowly evolving regional peace plan produced a cease-fire in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in March 1988, brought about talks between <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s guerrillas and government and produced the program for demobilization of Contra groups by Dec. 5 <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> was expected to arrive early Sunday just moments before the opening of the meeting. He said he would discuss the demobilization of the Contras and his government was willing to extend the deadline until Dec. 31.

 A man accused of laundering more than $ 1 billion for a Colombian cocaine cartel has been extradited from <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. Uruguayan national police turned <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON> over to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents at a naval base under heavy guard Friday and he was flown to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that night, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, assistant agent in charge of criminal investigations and organized crime activities in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. An alleged key member of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, which is believed to supply a majority of the cocaine entering this country, <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON> was a target of a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> investigation code-named Operation Polar Cap, which has been described as the biggest money-laundering probe in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON>, a 39-year-old native of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, had been held in a Uruguayan jail since February. His extradition occurred just two days after a devastating terrorist bombing blamed on cocaine traffickers killed dozens and wounded hundreds outside <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s police intelligence headquarters. A group of drug lords calling themselves `` the Extraditables'' has been waging a terror campaign of bombings and assassinations to force the government to end its war on the cartel and stop the extraditions. <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON> was a `` badly wanted'' fugitive and his extradition `` marks yet another turning point in the willingness of the international community, particularly in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, to work with us in bringing to an end the tyranny and impunity of these drug empires,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. Operation Polar Cap led to the indictment of <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON> and 30 others in February. The probe allegedly uncovered a bogus gold shipping network dubbed `` La Mina,'' the mine, that laundered about $ 1.2 billion of drug money between 1987 and February 1989. `` The charges against <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON> allege that he personally controlled the flow of over $ 1 billion of drug money out of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, a 35-year-old Colombian economist and reputed financial wizard behind the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel, was sent to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on Sept. 6 to face charges stemming from Polar Cap. He was the first person extradited since the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government began its crackdown on drug traffickers. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON> was under tight security. Officials would not disclose his location more specifically than the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> metropolitan area. <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON> was scheduled to appear before a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Monday. <PERSON> Vivas </PERSON> has claimed he is a legal trader in gold. <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> has some of the most liberal banking laws in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Citizens and foreigners may enter and leave the country with gold, and freely transfer capital in and out.
