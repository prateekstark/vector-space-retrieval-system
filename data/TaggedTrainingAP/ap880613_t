 High above <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s imposing skyline, the final girders are swinging into place atop the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION>'s striking prism-shaped building The 70-story glass-and-steel building, to be the local headquarters of mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official bank, is a none-too-subtle symbol of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s unrivaled influence and growing activity in this British colony which reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s soaring presence is a result of market-oriented economic reforms championed by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and the part of the agreement with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> that says <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> can keep its capitalist system for 50 years after 1997. Chinese officials of various ranks are invading <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> for a crash course in capitalism and to secure money-making deals. The big Chinese companies are wheeling and dealing in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s high-flying property market, investing in major construction projects and even buying large blocks of local stock Chinese diplomats are busy too. <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiatun </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top diplomat in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, shows up at pop concerts and cocktail parties. He heads the local branch of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> but is viewed by many as the colony's shadow <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>'s main task is to promote stability and prosperity in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, and he is full of kind words for its capitalist society. `` We have some comrades who always fear capitalism, but in fact they do n't understand that the modern capitalist system is a great creation of human civilization,'' he has told reporters. No official figures are available to show how many China-backed companies are in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, but estimates run into the thousands. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is widely regarded as the largest foreign investor in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, with estimates ranging from $ 6 billion to $ 8 billion. The investments include department stores, factories, supermarkets and real estate. Much of the activity is financed by the 14-member <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> group, which saw profits rise by 30 percent to 60 percent in 1987, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> financial research firm. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s property purchases in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> totaled about $ 1 billion last year, exceeded only by Japanese and local investors, according to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwan </PERSON> of <PERSON> Chesterton </PERSON> <PERSON> Petty </PERSON>, an international property consulting company. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> snatched up hotels, office buildings and residential high-rises. `` They have to support the political confidence of people'' in the years before 1997, <PERSON> Kwan </PERSON> said, noting that the injection of Chinese capital creates demand and raises real estate prices. Some deals reflect the need for more space by expanding Chinese companies while other deals are strictly to make money. <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, for example, bought an office building near the central business district for about $ 45 million in May 1987 and then sold it to Japanese interests five months later for a 35 percent profit, according to <PERSON> Chesterton </PERSON> <PERSON> Petty </PERSON>. Other Chinese moves that have turned heads in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> include: _ Bailouts of financially troubled <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> banks and a pledge by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> of the equivalent in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> dollars of $ 128 million to save the colony's teetering futures exchange after the global stock market crash in October _ The purchase by <ORGANIZATION> CITIC </ORGANIZATION>, which is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s premier international investment company, of 12.5 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Cathay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the territory's profitable flag carrier _ Participation of three Chinese companies in three competing consortia bidding for a multimillion-dollar tunnel project through the suburban New Territories Matching <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s flurry of economic activity in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> has been its expanded political work. From the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> headquarters across the street from the <LOCATION> Happy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> race track, a staff of several hundred stay in touch with nearly every sector of society. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s Chinese-language Wide Angle magazine reported that the news agency has separate departments responsible for keeping in touch with the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government, students, grass-root organizations and the colony's elite. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Y.S </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON>, a political science lecturer at <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION>, says <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s plan to win over local residents is `` a longtime process of befriending us, of co-opting us, so when the Chinese come -LRB- in 1997 -RRB- there's a very good chance of us being immobilized or at least neutralized.'' One group that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has successfully cultivated is the power elite, who believe toeing the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> line is the best way to keep their businesses healthy after 1997. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also can count on several local organizations to support its policies here. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>, which represents about 170,000 workers, mobilized its members last year to support <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s opposition to general legislative elections in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> this year. This, along with the colonial government's decision to delay elections until 1991, has led some local activists to believe <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> already is calling the shots in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 When the dust storms come, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> vanishes from sight behind a white cloud that grittily obscures all sense of what is and is not real. Then the winds die down, and the dust suspended in the air drifts to the ground. The sun breaks through and the city of mud brick houses and 2 million people shimmers back into view. It's a bit like stepping into a magic spell and visiting `` Brigadoon,'' the Scottish Highlands town in the Broadway musical that appears for a day once every hundred years before fading away into the mist again. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> has that same sense. The distinction between reality and fantasy blurs. The Afghan capital is at once communist and capitalist. The government of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> is one of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s most successful attempts to impose communist rule on a Moslem nation. But here, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has entered the fray by supporting and helping arm the anti-communist guerrillas who are fighting Afghan and Soviet soldiers. And in spite of the Soviet-style government, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> is a capitalist city. Dollars are avidly sought by merchants who sell everything from century-old handwoven Afghan carpets to gaudy lace stockings from <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> sweatshops. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> is a city full of life and, increasingly, of death. Teen-age girls strive for the latest styles as their tailors stitch government-issue blue cotton into school uniforms patterned on the skirts and jackets shown in European fashion magazines. The markets bustle with more traditionally clad women wearing the `` chadri,'' an all-enveloping veil that descends in pleats from a skullcap with only a coarse mesh panel over the eyes to let the wearer see out. Small boys in pajama-like tunics and pants turn cartwheels in grassy traffic circles, dodging sprays of water from tanker trucks that keep the geraniums blossoming. At night, streets are virtually deserted. The rare motorist is suddenly stopped by an Afghan soldier who emerges from the gloom to wave his rifle and check the traveler's identity. Soviet soldiers have started withdrawing from other cities as part of a pullout the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> says will by Feb. 15 end its eight-year military intervention. But they still surround <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> with a ring of tanks, armored personnel carriers and fortified bunkers. Guerrilla rockets hit <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> several times a week, usually at night. Often they land near <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> and Soviet military posts, but rockets are notoriously inaccurate and many of the casualties are civilians asleep in their homes. One of these victims was carried into a hospital X-ray room a few days ago. The white-haired man lay unconscious on a narrow bed of ropes woven across a wooden frame. His right eye was closed, his left concealed by a bloody bandage. Blood stains covered the shoulders of his brown tunic, and one leg lay at an improbable angle under a red plaid blanket. He had been brought to the hospital, bed and all, by three men wearing turbans, baggy trousers and layers of robes. The old man lived, according to a hospital staff member who said such victims arrive almost every morning. But the staffer refused to give specific numbers, reflecting a reluctance to make statements not authorized by the government. Death is tangible at <LOCATION> Tapa-e-Shuhadan </LOCATION>, `` the Hill of the Martyrs,'' <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s cemetery for government troops who have died in the decade of fighting the mujahedeen, or Moslem holy warriors. <PERSON> Tapa-e-Shuhadan </PERSON> is off-limits much of the time, even to mourners, for it is in a military zone. A visit to the hill quickly reveals the reason: <PERSON> Tapa-e-Shuhadan </PERSON> sits atop a huge ammunition dump, evident from the concrete doorways and little ventilation chimneys built into the slopes below the graves. The members of the Peace, <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friendship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> who escort foreign visitors to the cemtery were at a loss to say how many men are buried there. But a rough reckoning, achieved by counting graves in one quadrant and extrapolating, made 10,000 seem a conservative estimate. These escorted visits add to the blurring of reality and unreality in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. But there are other encounters that seem genuine, like the one with a man in a crocheted white skullcap who declared himself a `` mujahed,'' one of those seeking to oust the government. He spat on the ground to express his contempt for the Afghan government, communism and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Speaking in Arabic he said he had learned from the Koran, Islam's holy book, and from three pilgrimmages to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> _ one of the countries arming the mujahedeen, he said: `` God willing, the brotherhood of Moslems will see victory in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Drug Raises IQ Of AIDS-afflicted Children, Report Says</HEAD>

 A drug widely used to treat adults with AIDS appears to dramatically reverse the devastating effects of the disease on the brains of children, new research shows. The AIDS virus frequently robs young victims of their ability to talk and walk and lowers their intelligence. The latest research shows that the drug AZT seems to bring back children's speech as well as other functions controlled by the brain. `` Functional ability returned to normal in many kids,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzo </PERSON>, who directed the study at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. His research was presented Sunday at the opening of the Fourth International Conference on AIDS. AZT, also known as zidovudine or Retrovir, is the only medicine routinely used to suppress the AIDS virus, called HIV. In adults, it can slow the progression of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome but does not cure it. <PERSON> Pizzo </PERSON>'s findings were made unexpectedly during the testing of a portable pump to administer the drug to children. He found that among other changes, the youngsters' IQ scores rose about 15 points after they got the medicine. `` Everybody who looks at this data has to get excited,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoth </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases. `` We are all nervous by small numbers -LRB- of patients studied -RRB-, but the data itself is very exciting.'' Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> also cautioned that the preliminary study did not include a comparison group. `` It's intriguing,'' he said of the results. `` I would have liked to have seen a control group who were not treated.'' <PERSON> Pizzo </PERSON> tested AZT on 21 AIDS-infected children who ranged in age from 14 months to 12 years. About two-thirds got the virus from blood products, while the rest were infected by their mothers before birth. <PERSON> Pizzo </PERSON> said that 62 percent of the patients had suffered clear neurological damage from the virus, and `` in every case they were improved'' after taking AZT. The IQs of those who had obvious brain impairment rose from about 70 to 85. Among those who were judged to be mentally normal when the study began, the IQs improved from about 95 to 105, suggesting that they had probably already suffered subtle mental injury from the infection. <PERSON> Pizzo </PERSON> said the youngsters' continued to improve steadily nine months after the treatment started. Brain scans also showed that missing tissue seemed to be restored in the infected youngsters' brains. <PERSON> Pizzo </PERSON> speculated that cells that had been shrunken by the virus were restored to their normal size. He cautioned that further study will be necessary to learn how long the improvement lasts and whether the children eventually worsen again. In a separate study, Dr. <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilfert </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, described a preliminary three-month study of the drug's safety in children. She said the work shows that youngsters tolerate the treatment well, and while it's too soon to draw firm conclusions, `` our feeling is that the number of opportunistic infections is substantially reduced.'' Research by Dr. <PERSON> Maxime </PERSON> <PERSON> Seligmann </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hopital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saint-Louis </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> suggests that combining AZT with the herpes drug acyclovir significantly improves its effectiveness in people with AIDS. In four months of testing on 130 patients, there were 25 deaths among patients who got AZT alone, compared with 11 among people who got both drugs. `` These preliminary data suggest that acyclovir may have additional benefit without additional toxicity in patients with full-blown AIDS,'' <PERSON> Seligmann </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>After A $13 Million Facelift, Blair House Now Fit For A King</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The president's guest house is meant to be fit for a king, but when explosive gas leaked in and a chandelier crashed onto the bed where visiting heads of state sleep, some work was clearly in order. Six years and $ 13 million later, <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is now a `` guest house worthy of this great nation,'' says Ambassador <PERSON> Selwa </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, the chief of protocol, who oversaw the restoration. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could n't stay there last December for his summit with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> because the house was closed for repairs. But should he return this year he would find a new wing, renovated kitchen, plumbing, fire and safety systems, new electrical heating and air conditioning. Not a palace, perhaps, but not the dilapidated antique it was in June 1982. Then the house was judged uninhabitable after gas leaked into the boiler room and a chandelier fell on the bed, fortunately then unoccupied. `` We all realized that the house was in very bad shape. All you had to do was look at it,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. `` It had a veneer of looking all right because it had a certain warmth and all of that. But the minute you started looking, the rugs were threadbare, the steps were sagging. The plumbing was unbelievable. The kitchens were like kitchens at the turn of the century.'' <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> actually predates the turn of the century, and it is an architectural gem rich in history. It consists of four connecting buildings across from the White House on <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> and around the corner on Jackson Place. The original house dates from 1824 and was long owned by <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, a member of the powerful, intimate group around President <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> that was called the `` kitchen cabinet.'' Later, the house was a meeting place for leaders on both sides of the conflict that became the Civil War. In a small room to the right of the front door, Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was offered the command of the Union Armies and declined in favor of his native Commonwealth of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> approved the acquisition of the house in 1942, saying the government needed it `` for the entertainment of distinguished visitors.'' On Nov. 1, 1950, an assassination attempt was made on President <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by two Puerto Rican nationalists who attempted to force their way in. The attempt failed, and one of the nationalists was killed. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffelt </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> guard, died in preventing the assailants from gaining entrance, and a plaque outside the house commemorates his heroism. In more recent times, columnist <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> McLellan </PERSON> got into hot water in 1981 when, writing her column for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, she carried an item that then-President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had `` bugged'' Blair House where President-elect <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was staying before the inaugural. The Post retracted the item after <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> threatened to sue for libel. When the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> decided in 1982 that <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was so dilapidated it was dangerous, the agency said millions of dollars were needed to repair the structure. `` The alternative was to tear it down. There was nothing in between,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appropriated $ 8.6 million, and another $ 4.8 million was raised from private sources to pay for the project. Mrs. <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> hopes to have more than $ 1 million left for a fund to maintain the house. There has been little skimping in the refurbishing. The collection of antiques has been expanded, many of them donated along with china, silver and fabrics. The room where visiting heads of state receive the press is an uncommonly elegant pressroom with its two fireplaces, blue damask upholstery, red serabend rugs and view of the White House across <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sees the house as one of its diplomatic assets. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has said the `` feelings of being truly welcome, which staying at the presidential guest house foster, can tip the balance in our favor with many nations where personal relationships are vitally important.'' `` When people feel well-treated and warmly treated, this makes it much easier,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> says. She believes the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people can be proud of the house, which she says is neither ostentatious nor `` plebian.'' `` They do n't want pretensions because the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are n't that way This house sort of straddles a very nice line. It's not too grand, but it has elegance,'' she says. `` It's really just the right degree of grandness.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: British Cop Describes Frame Over Northern Ireland
Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 British police have a new expression in their vocabulary. `` He's been Stalkered,'' they say, meaning, `` He's been framed.'' The term also has become synonymous with abuse of power by British authorities in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. For instance, when policemen shot and killed three unarmed guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in the British colony of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> in March, the media raised the specter of another `` Stalker Affair.'' The man whose gave rise to such expressions is <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalker </PERSON>, a former detective with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s national police agency who has written a book about his official inquiry into suspicions that the police in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> had a `` shoot to kill'' policy toward suspected guerrillas of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Stalker Affair,'' which chronicles Stalker's investigation of the Royal Ulster Constabulary -LRB- RUC -RRB- and his subsequent downfall, has swiftly risen to the top of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s best-seller charts and was published in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in May. It will be published in paperback in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> this fall. Stalker, tall and lean, was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> recently to promote his book. `` The book has become a handle to attach to the issue of the accountability of police and security services in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>,'' he said in an interview. With unassuming calm, Stalker discussed the furor his book has stirred in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and the embarrassment it caused the government of <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> by describing clumsy handling of the tensions between majority Protestants and minority <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Aptly named, <PERSON> Stalker </PERSON> made his career hunting moors murderers, thieves and prostitutes. In 1984 he was asked to investigate the <ORGANIZATION> RUC </ORGANIZATION> after one of its members reported that fellow officers had lied in court about the 1982 shooting deaths of six suspected <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. The six were unarmed. `` The circumstances of those shootings pointed to a police inclination, if not a policy, to shoot suspects dead without warning rather than to arrest them,'' Stalker wrote. His investigation took a bizarre twist when, on the verge of obtaining a secret tape to prove his suspicions, Stalker was pulled off the case and suspended from the force. Over the next three months, in the summer of 1986, he endured a humiliating and much publicized investigation into what now appear to have been trumped-up charges. Stalker was accused of consorting with a suspected criminal and of impropriety in the use of police cars. A police board subsequently exonerated him and he was reinstated as the deputy chief of the <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> police _ <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s second-largest urban police force. He resigned seven months later, saying his commander did not want him on the force. In an interim report, Stalker had recommended that 11 police officers be prosected for perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by lying under oath about the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> shooting incidents. The government has since said that although `` serious criminal breaches'' were found in the affair, prosecution of the 11 would damage security and would not be in the public interest. In the course of his probe, Stalker discovered the existence of a tape which recorded events in the hayshed where one of the six victims, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tighe </PERSON>, 17, was shot dead. Stalker was told by informants that the tape would prove <PERSON> Tighe </PERSON> had been killed without warning. Stalker battled for months to get the tape of the electronic surveillance of the hayshed, which was believed to be an arms depot for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. About to get the tape, Stalker was called off the investigation. `` The decision that resulted in my removal was, I think, a political one,'' he wrote. `` My interim report was read with anger and fear at senior levels within the <ORGANIZATION> RUC </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. The investigation also disturbed the delicate balance between Catholics and Protestants in the volatile province. `` The <ORGANIZATION> RUC </ORGANIZATION> has tried very hard to shed its sectarian image'' as a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> force, but the investigation was `` a setback,'' Stalker wrote. Stalker said he decided to write the book `` as a purge for me and my family'' after the harrowing experience they underwent. Stalker said he felt partly vindicated by a government announcement that changes had been made in the <ORGANIZATION> RUC </ORGANIZATION> regarding the accountability of its anti-terrorism squads, based on his report. Now, he added with resignation, he wants to get on with his new career in journalism. `` There is no one I can sue, no one I can name,'' he said. `` I am just another casualty of the political situation in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Newington Tries To Solve Problem Of Poorly Surveyed Subdivision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEAN GOLEMBESKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWINGTON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Residents of a subdivision have mowed each other's lawns for years but they never knew it until a surveyor's error was recently discovered and showed that all 104 lots were improperly plotted. Due to the surveyor's miscalculation more than a decade ago when the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION> subdivision was laid out, none of the lots in the subdivision of the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> suburb was correctly mapped out, officials said. For example, while one homeowner may have built a fence on what appears to be his lot, it technically sits on his neighbor's property Early indications are that some the boundaries are off as much as 3 feet, said Town Manager <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>. The error was discovered during the construction of an adjacent condominium project. `` The acreage is right, it's just not where you think it is,'' <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said last week. All the houses, which range in value from $ 200,000 to $ 300,000, and built-in swimming pools appear to be on their proper lots. But shrubs, fences and sidewalks are n't. Town officials have intervened because of the number of homeowners involved and because the town's right-of-way, which includes the sidewalks, may have to be moved. As a first step, the town appropriated $ 17,500 to resurvey the subdivision, and the results are expected in August. `` We're preparing a map showing all the trees and all the fences,'' <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said. Once they have the map in hand, officials will try to sort out the problem. Officials say they might just leave everything as it is and file new deeds, or they might make everything conform to existing deeds. <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said that because of legal obligations, such as mortgage agreements, things ca n't be left alone. Both solutions undoubtedly will prove difficult and involve banks, title insurance companies, attorneys and lots of paperwork. `` We do n't know which is more practical, which is more economical. It can get ticklish if you move boundaries,'' <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said. `` You're talking about a community effort.'' So far, <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION> residents have cooperated and have reacted calmly to the situtation. `` Obviously, people are nervous about it. I call it a sleeping-dog issue,'' said <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Harpie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION> resident and town councilman. `` No one wants to be the first to draw their gun. I'm hopeful that once the town determines its right-of-way, the neighbors will work something out.'' One resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said some neighbors are willing to rewrite deeds, if necessary, to conform to what exists. But, two are fighting over the location of a fence that may have to come down. <PERSON> Vinny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, another subdivision resident, laughed about the situation. `` It's unfortunate,'' he said, `` the city is going to spend a lot of money resurveying.'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> became serious only when talking about the possible expense of refiling his deed. The surveyor, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> of W.E. Peters Land Surveyors, is dead. A developer of the subdivision said his company has no stake in the matter. `` The ironic part is that if there was n't additional development going on -LRB- in <LOCATION> Newington </LOCATION> -RRB- it would never have been picked up,'' <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Medicare Benefits Bill Contains Tax-Increase Surprise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The politicians taking credit for passage of a new program to protect the elderly from the financial ravages of catastrophic illness have been less eager to acknowledge that it also means a major tax increase for millions of older Americans. Those who benefit from the legislation now awaiting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s signature would pay the entire cost _ at least for the near future. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> itself estimates the average tax increase will be $ 285 per person in 1989 and $ 506 in 1993. Sponsors of the bill, however, are reluctant to use the term `` tax increase'' in public discussions of the bill. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, repeatedly referred to it as `` a new income-related premium. For many Medicare recipients, the increase would more than wipe out what they gained when the tax system was overhauled in 1986. The tax increase would start at 15 percent next year, jump to 25 percent in 1990 and then rise by as much as one percentage point a year thereafter, conceivably reaching 35 percent by the end of the century. This tax increase would pay for about two-thirds of the cost of protecting <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> recipients against catastrophic hospital, physician and drug expenses; the program would cost an estimated $ 33 billion over the next five years alone. The remainder of the cost would be covered by raising the monthly Part B premium paid by recipients for doctors' services. `` We have not asked our children to pay the medical bills that we incur,'' said Rep. <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. `` These benefits will be paid for by the men and women who will use the coverage.'' But even some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who voted for the bill worried aloud that as the tax burden on the elderly grows, pressure will mount to have other taxpayers share the cost. The compromise bill cleared by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week is considerably more generous than the version recommended by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Nevertheless, there is no indication that the president will veto it, even with the tax increase. Backers of the bill acknowledge that no more than 7 percent of the elderly and disabled who are eligible for Medicare would benefit from the bill, even though all will have to pay the Part B increase and many will face the new tax. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, compared the bill to fire insurance. `` Not everybody is going to have a catastrophic illness and not everybody wants to have a fire either,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, `` but what you are paying is an insurance premium that takes the law of averages and applies it to the individual, with the fervent hope that the vast majority never have the need to use this benefit.'' Negotiators who wrote the final version of the bill decided that paying for the expansion solely by raising the Part B premium would have made it prohibitively expensive for lower-income people. The final compromise, said Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., `` takes into consideration an individual's ability to pay for this protection and in doing so allows this coverage to be more affordable for low-income beneficiaries. The bill includes several restrictions on how the tax would be applied: _ It would hit only those people eligible for Medicare -LRB- generally age 65 or older or disabled -RRB- whose incomes are high enough that they already pay at least $ 150 income tax Typically, a couple over 65 with adjusted gross income of $ 11,000 or less would not be subject to the increase. Congressional staffers estimate that in 1989, about 40 percent of Americans over the age of 65 would have to pay the tax increase. A private organization, the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION>, estimates 46 percent next year and 56 percent by 1993. _ The maximum tax would be $ 800 per person in 1989 -LRB- $ 1,600 for a couple if both spouses are eligible for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, rising to $ 1,050 -LRB- $ 2,100 per couple -RRB- in 1993 _ The tax will be at a rate of $ 22.50 for each $ 150 of regular income-tax liability in 1989; by 1993, $ 42 per $ 150 of liability According to the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, a couple with $ 21,000 adjusted gross income and taking the standard deduction would face a tax increase of $ 236 in 1989 and $ 441 in 1993. At $ 31,500 income, the increase would be $ 473 next year and $ 882 in 1993. On the average, taxpayers with incomes between $ 20,000 and $ 30,000 were given a $ 220 tax cut in the 1986 tax overhaul; those between $ 30,000 and $ 40,000 averaged $ 273. The increase in the monthly Part B premium required by the bill would be the same regardless of income. In 1989, the $ 27.10 premium would rise to $ 31.10, and by 1993 would be $ 42.60 a month.

<HEAD>Splits Over Taxes, Defense, But Jackson Prevails On South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The forces of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> are still miles apart on taxes, defense and many foreign policy issues. But a preliminary platform-drafting session ended with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> getting one wish: that the Democrats brand <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state. The platform writers boarded this island's horse-drawn taxis and headed home Sunday after three days of deliberations that produced working papers on health, education, civil rights and other issues. The papers were generated by committee staff working with surrogates of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The papers on defense and foreign policy have yet to be written, and on taxes `` we agreed to disagree,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> congressman leading <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s platform team. The 16-member drafting committee left without casting any votes, but will meet again sometime before the full 186-member <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> convenes in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> June 25-26. The Jackson forces encountered little opposition on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> issue, although earlier in the campaign, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> balked when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> tried to extract such a pledge from him. `` We have no problem declaring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state, but let's go beyond that,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> backer from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, the certain nominee, favors passage of the tough sanctions in a bill that could put the apartheid regime in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> on the same <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> list of terrorist states as <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. But the delegates parted company Sunday on another bedrock issue for the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign: whether to freeze <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending. Two labor leaders rose to the defense of the defense budget and nuclear deterrence. <PERSON> Rachelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, political director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, said the Democrats must root out <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> waste, but also `` honor our treaty obligations and defend democratic institutions and our freedoms.'' `` I hope this platform will call for a stable defense budget,'' she said. `` The defense budget is not a sacred cow,'' retorted <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> McLemore </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backer from <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. Later, when <PERSON> McLemore </PERSON> urged the party to forswear first use of nuclear weapons, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Booe </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said 40 years of bargaining has taught him never to tell `` any adversary for sure I'm not going to do anything. ... I want to keep them off balance.'' The Democrats' working papers call for appointment of a federal drug czar, an Equal Rights Amendment, ending homelessness, expanding AIDS research, and providing advance notice of plant closings. Without using the word abortion, the civil rights paper calls for `` freedom of reproductive choice ... regardless of ability to pay.'' `` I found more areas of agreement than disagreement,'' said Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, the drafting panel chair. Those who hoped for divisive bloodletting `` will find the floor is clean,'' said <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s platform chief. She predicted it will be easier to reach an accord on defense than on taxes. `` If by ` stable' they mean something close to what we mean by ` freeze,' then perhaps there's room for compromise,'' <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Albright </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> foreign policy adviser, said: `` I think you will not see ... ` freeze' in the platform. <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, lawyer, urged that the platform embrace <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s views on self-determination for the Palestinians. <PERSON> Albright </PERSON> told reporters flatly the platform will not contain such language. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Borosage </PERSON>, a senior <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser, said the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> camp will be insistent on its demand to further tax the rich and freeze defense spending. `` We've got agreements with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on commitments for a whole range of domestic programs, but where's the money going to come from?'' he said. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> platform team leader, was asked if the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign would relish an opportunity in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to reject a minority plank favoring a tax hike. `` We're not seeking floor fights,'' he said, adding that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has enough delegates `` to take anything he wishes to the convention.''

 A strong earthquake startled residents over a 350-mile expanse of Northern and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Sunday night, but authorities said there were no immediate reports of serious damage or injuries. The quake hit at 6:45 p.m. and had a magnitude of 5.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, said a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. Its epicenter was on the <LOCATION> Calaveras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fault </LOCATION> about 10 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Alum </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey in <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> estimated the temblor at 5.3. Geophysicist <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellsworth </PERSON> said the earthquake's 5-mile-long center was just north of the epicenter of a 6.2 quake in <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> in 1984, the region's largest temblor in years An earthquake of 5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is considered capable of causing substantial damage, but authorities said they had no damage reports worse than a few cracked ceilings and a broken water heater and water pipe in nearby <LOCATION> Milpitas </LOCATION>. `` The whole mountain shook,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, a maintenance supervisor for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> atop 2,571-foot <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tamalpais </LOCATION> 10 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Residents as far south as <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION> and as far north as <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rosa </LOCATION> flooded authorities and media with calls about the quake. Police and sheriff's spokesmen throughout the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> counties to the north all said they had felt it but were unaware of any damage. `` It lasted longer than they usually do,'' said <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON>. `` It came all of a sudden and then leveled and rolled off.'' `` It was the strongest quake I've felt here in years,'' said meteorologist <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Pechner </PERSON> of radio station <ORGANIZATION> KNBR </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and a life-long resident of the area. A resident of <LOCATION> Foster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> said people ran out into the street after the quake hit. A <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> resident said bottles fell off the shelf in his house and plants were tipped over. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Trevan </PERSON>, a motorist who was driving over the Golden Gate Bridge, said his car `` jumped a little bit'' during the quake. <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> crews slowed trains to check for damage to the tracks, but found none, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> said it had no reports of power outages in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> area adjacent to the epicenter. The quake was the third reported Sunday in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Mild earthquakes jolted <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Solano </LOCATION> counties in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the inland area of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> around <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, but there were no reports of damage or injury. The <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> quake also was felt in the cities of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, about 50 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. It struck about 2:20 p.m. PDT, was centered about five miles east-southeast of <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, and measured 3.4 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, said Hall Daily, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. The temblor was the second widely felt quake to hit <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> since Friday, when a shaker measuring 5.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale hit 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and was felt in much of central and southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Daily said initial data indicated it was unlikely the Sunday quake was related to the one which struck Friday. The Napa-Solano quake which measured 3.3 on the Richter scale, occurred at 2:44 p.m., the Seismographic Stations at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> reported. The epicenter was near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berryessa </LOCATION>, about 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vacaville </LOCATION> police received dozens of calls from residents who were n't sure what the jolt was, said dispatcher <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Weishaar </PERSON>. `` Many of the people were confused because it did n't feel like an earthquake. Some people thought it might have been a sonic boom,'' she said. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in the strenth of the shaking. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a `` major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage, and 8 is a `` great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale.

 Most Americans say a vice presidential nominee's race and sex are irrelevant, but some independents and Republicans would hestiate to support a black for the job, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll has found Some Republicans also expressed reluctance about supporting a woman for vice president, the national survey said. Independents did not shy from a woman candidate, and Democrats did not lean away from a black or a woman. The survey also indicated a substantial majority of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> would oppose President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for a third term if he could run again. Most Republicans favored another <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> term; independents and Democrats did not. The poll also found that 89 percent of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> would not want to be president and a plurality would not want their child to be. Fifty-nine percent thought it possible their child could be president. On the question of vice presidential candidates, 75 percent of the 1,204 respondents said it would not matter to them if a ticket's second slot were filled by a black or a woman. Still, 17 percent of independents said they would be less likely to vote for a ticket with a black for vice president, compared with 4 percent who would be more likely to back it. The division was wider among Republicans, while there was no measurable split among Democrats. The survey did not specify any candidate. Black civil rights activist <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, second-place finisher for the Democratic presidential nomination, has said he should be offered the vice presidential slot. With a woman for vice president, 20 percent of Republicans said they would be less likely to support the ticket, while 6 percent said they would be more likely. There was no such reluctance among Democrats or independents. No potential woman candidate was specified. There have been suggestions that Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has locked up the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination for president, may select a woman to shore up his support among women. Overall, 10 percent of respondents said they would be more likely to support a woman for vice president, 14 percent less likely. That split was within the poll's margin of sampling error of 3 points. Given a black vice presidential candidate, 6 percent overall said they would be more likely to lend their support, 18 percent less likely. The split was wider for the presidency: Five percent said they would be more likely to support a black, 27 percent less likely. Ten percent said they would be more likely to back a woman for president, 25 percent less likely. However, more than six in 10 said it would not matter if a candidate for president were black or female. The poll's finding on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> indicates a sharp drop with Democrats and independents, whose support was critical to his 1980 and 1984 victories. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984 won 25 percent of Democrats and 63 percent of independent voters. But in the survey, just 13 percent of Democrats and 27 percent of independents said they would vote for him for a third term. Presidents are limited by Constitutional amendment to two four-year terms, and about 65 percent each of Republicans, Democrats and independents favored maintaining that limit. But if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> could run again, 60 percent of Republicans said they would vote for him, while 85 percent of Democrats and 67 percent of independents said they would not. The total was 32 percent for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, 64 percent against. Majorities of conservatives, moderates and liberals alike said they would not want a third <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> term. Women and poorer Americans were more likely to oppose the idea. Respondents overwhelmingly attached importance to the office: Eighty-nine percent said it matters who is elected president. The same percentage said they would not want the job, and 46 percent would not want their child to become president. Forty-one percent would. The Media General-Associated Press poll consisted of telephone interviews April 29-May 8 with a randomly selected sample of 1,204 adults across the nation. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the Tampa -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION> -RRB-.

<TEXT>
 The legal complexities in the Iran-Contra prosecution of former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and three co-defendants are sometimes as perplexing to the lawyers and the judge as they are to the general public. A continuing legal battle is being fought on several fronts between independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and lawyers for <PERSON> North </PERSON>, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. Here are some answers to a number of questions about the case: Q. Who is charged with what? A. All four defendants are charged with conspiring to defraud the government, theft of government property and wire fraud in the diversion of profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> North </PERSON> are both charged with lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. North also faces charges of obstructing a presidential inquiry, with pocketing $ 4,300 in travelers' checks a Contra leader gave him to cover expenses, with accepting an illegal gratuity in the form of a $ 15,000 high-security fence around his home, with obstructing an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> inquiry into the fence, and with conspiring to illegally use a tax-exempt foundation to raise money to help arm the Contras. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> are charged with conspiring to py illegal gratuities to North by setting up a $ 200,000 fund for North's family and by arranging installation of the fence Q: When is the case going to trial? A: That is still up in the air. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said last week that the defendants should be tried individually so that he could ensure they each get a fair trial. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he would decide major pre-trial issues by July 1. The first trial likely will begin during the fall presidential campaign. Q. Who goes first? <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> designated <PERSON> North </PERSON> as the leadoff defendant, to be followed by <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. Q. Why did <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> order four separate trials? A. The judge was presented with a unique problem because three of the four defendants _ <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> _ testified last year before congressional hearings under grants of limited immunity from prosecution. As a rule, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is prevented from using the testimony of the defendants against them as evidence. Q. What does that have to do with holding four separate trials? <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ruled that each defendant has a right to present a co-defendant's immunized testimony as evidence of his innocence. If a joint trial were held, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> would have to choose between protecting, say, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s Fifth Amendment right not to have his congressional testimony used against him and the Sixth Amendment right of <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to use <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as evidence of their innocence. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, both say that testimony by <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> would help clear them of any wrongdoing by showing that they acted with the understanding their activities were approved by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. Q. Is <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s order a blow to the prosecution? A. Prosecutors do n't generally like trying conspiracy cases against individual defendants. It's easier to show a jury how the actions of each member furthered an alleged conspiracy if all the defendants are being tried together. It means <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s resources will be seriously stretched and the cases will take a long time to try. Q: What are the remaining issues before <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> can set a trial date? A: The judge must decide whether the immunized congressional testimony of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> tainted the investigation of prosecutors. But his decision to hold four trials appears to foreshadow a decision that congressional immunity wo n't be a barrier to trying the case. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> also has to rule on whether procedures for handling 200,000 pages of classified documents collected during <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s investigation will protect the defendants' rights to a fair trial Q. What are those? A. The Classified Information Procedures Act requires the defense to notify the prosecution before trial of any government secrets it expects to use as evidence in the case. Defense lawyers contend this will tip off the prosecution. Q. Can the court force the government to declassify secret documents needed for the trials? A. No. If there is a large enough volume of material that the government agencies wo n't release, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> would be forced to drop the case. If the government determines that a particular document is so sensitive it ca n't be made public, the law provides several ways for the information to be presented. The court can order a statement of what the document would prove, can substitute a statement of facts that a document would prove for the actual material, or the judge can also delete sensitive portions of the material. Q: What sorts of secrets are involved? A: The keepers of government secrets are especially sensitive about any document that reveals the source of foreign intelligence. The government also is anxious to protect information revealing that a foreign country provided information or was involved in a secret initiative with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> speculated at a hearing that the defendants may want to introduce evidence about other covert operations they engaged in to show that the procedures were no different than those followed in the Iran-Contra affair. The judge said evidence about other secret operations might help the defendants show they acted with authority or at least the belief they had the permission of higher officials.

 This <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll is based on telephone interviews April 29-May 8 with 1,204 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The phone numbers were selected randomly by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning the results theoretically would be within three points of the same 19 times out of 20 if every adult American were asked the same questions. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ five points for Republicans, for example. There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and responses in this poll: 1. Presidents now are limited to two four-year terms in office. Do you think it should be one-six year term, stay at two four-year terms, be three four-year terms, or four or more four-year terms? One six-year: 16 percent. Two four-year: 65 percent. Three four-year: 8 percent. Four or more four-year: 5 percent. None of these: 4 percent. Do n't know or no answer: 2 percent. 2. If <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> could run again, would you vote for him for a third term as president? Yes: 32 percent. No: 64 percent. Do n't know or no answer: 4 percent. 3. I'm going to read a few attributes that might be found in a candidate for president. Tell me if each would make you more likely to vote for that candidate for president, or less likely to vote for that candidate, or if it would n't matter. a. A woman. More likely: 10 percent.

<HEAD>Group Says More `Soft Money' Flowing Into Election Process</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` Untold millions'' of dollars from corporations and labor unions are flowing into the nation's election process through a legal loophole, says a report released today by a bipartisan research group Union and corporate contributions to state and local political parties for activities that are not directly used on federal elections are generally known as `` soft money.'' The national party organizations _ the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ also collect and disburse soft money in a variety of ways permitted by federal law. These funds are not required by law to be reported at the federal level. And only some states have strict reporting requirements. The Center for Responsive Politics said it identified $ 3.3 million in corporate contributions to political parties in five states in the 1985-86 election cycle _ <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` This amount, if multiplied nationwide, would blossom into an enormous sum, despite the fact that there was no presidential race to boost contributions even higher,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, executive director of the center. Noting that nearly a billion dollars is tallied in reports to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on spending for congressional campaigns and presidential races, she added, `` Lying just below the surface are untold millions of additional dollars unaccounted for by the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>.'' The money can be used for such activities as state conventions, voter registration drives, research, office expenses and get-out-the-vote drives. Soft money plays an important role in presidential election years, since the major parties' presidential campaigns are paid for by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and the amounts the national parties can spend in addition are limited. Republicans have traditionally raised far more in soft money than Democrats, but the finance chairman for <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has talked of raising $ 42 million in soft money for the fall campaign. Based on reports filed with the five states involved, the center identified the following amounts in corporate contributions to state parties in 1985-86: <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>: Republicans, $ 808,290; Democrats, $ 295,389. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>: Republicans, $ 645,888; Democrats, $ 71,050. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>: Republicans, $ 466,445; Democrats, $ 458,258. Missouri: Republicans, $ 369,482; Democrats, $ 22,400. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: Republicans, $ 129,776; Democrats, $ 31,250. The center identified about 1,700 soft money contributions in these states, almost all of them from corporations. In its report, the center said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> gave $ 85,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, while <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> gave a total of $ 89,000 to the two state parties. The largest individual contribution identified by the center was by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, chairman of the board of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, who gave $ 100,000 to the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> GOP. The report referred to the publicly disclosed contribution of $ 1 million by <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> heir <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroc </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION>. At most, $ 20,000 of that could be used on federal elections under the law, meaning at least $ 980,000 would have to go into the <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION>'s soft-money accounts. The report also noted published reports of gifts to the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> totaling $ 150,000 from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Trammell </PERSON> <PERSON> Crow </PERSON>, $ 127,600 from <ORGANIZATION> Phillip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and $ 124,000 from <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Richfield </LOCATION>. Corporate and union money can also be used to pay for buildings for the national parties. The report mentioned contributions to the Democratic building funds of $ 50,000 from the painters' union, $ 10,000 from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and $ 5,000 from the machinists' union. It cited contributions to the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> fund of $ 40,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> and $ 24,120 from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Burnham </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Dukakis Has Net Worth Of At Least $500,000</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who once described himself as a `` man of few wants,'' lives in a duplex he bought 17 years ago for $ 25,000, drives a 5-year-old Dodge, buys his clothes at a bargain basement and generally vacations at the homes of friends or family. Despite his frugal lifestyle _ or perhaps because of it _ the apparent Democratic presidential nominee has a net worth of at least $ 500,000 in property, investments and salary and is the potential beneficiary of about $ 1 million controlled by trusts, according to his financial disclosure forms and statements made by his presidential campaign aides. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>, the governor's <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> press secretary, said the <PERSON> Dukakises </PERSON> `` live comfortably,'' but added: `` Nowadays there is n't much time to spend money on anything.'' The last time the Democratic presidential nominee-to-be took a financial risk was 25 years ago when, following the lead of two uncles in <LOCATION> Haverhill </LOCATION> a half century before, he took out two mortgages to buy the six-apartment building he was living in for $ 55,000. The investment proved successful. In 1971, eight years after buying the apartment building in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sold off the apartments as condominiums _ one of the first condo conversions in the state _ for a reported $ 26,000 profit. Earlier that year, he and his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, moved out of the apartment building and bought half of a side-by-side brick duplex down the street for $ 25,000. The Dukakises still live in that modest, three-story duplex _ since <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> is one of only three states that does n't provide a governor's residence But as a result of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s inflated real estate climate, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> home now carries an estimated value of $ 367,400 Like many Americans, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' home is the governor's single largest investment. Unlike many Americans, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has paid off the mortgage. Indeed, the governor, who refuses to use credit cards, has no reported debts. His only independent stock investment totals less than $ 1,000 in a small Massachusetts-based robotics manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Automatix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which brought him less than $ 100 in income last year, according to his financial disclosure forms. The governor has no vacation homes _ his vacations are usually mixed with family visits to a cousin's home in Ft.. <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, to Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' sister's home on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> or to her father's summer home in the He has no airplanes, boats or a garage full of cars. The only car owned by the man who likes to ride the subway to work is a 1983 Dodge valued last year at $ 2,750. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 54, has put his money into long-term investments aimed at retirement or benefiting his three children. After 25 years in state politics, first as a legislator and now as a three-term governor, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has built his state retirement account up to $ 49,494. If the governor has taken out life insurance, his federal and state financial disclosure forms do n't reveal it and his presidential campaign staff wo n't discuss it. He and Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have $ 44,610 in various savings, <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounts </ORGANIZATION> and checking accounts, some of which are considered trusts for his children, the campaign staff said. The governor and his wife reported total income last year of $ 108,957. Virtually all of it was from his $ 85,000-a-year governor's salary and Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' $ 20,000 as a part-time director of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> and the $ 2,000 she earned as director of a college textbook publisher The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' interest income amounted to $ 1,445. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also is the potential beneficiary of money from two $ 1 million trusts set up by his late father, <PERSON> Panos </PERSON>. However, half the money in those trusts is slated to go to <ORGANIZATION> Bates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' father went to school. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has reported two additional trusts, valued at a total of $ 110,000, which were set up by Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' late grandmother, <PERSON> Mabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, and her father, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>. But only the governor's wife and children are potential beneficiaries. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has no direct control over or involvement in any of these trusts. It was one of the trusts set up by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' father that drew attention last year when the governor filed a report with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> revealing that until 1986 _ when he was running for re-election _ the trust included stocks in companies doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In 1983, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vocally supported and signed legislation to divest <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> pension fund stocks with South African ties to protest that country's system of racial segregation. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, before withdrawing as a trustee of the trust last year, told the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, which manages the trust, to divest any South African-tied stocks. Stocks in 10 companies were immediately sold. Today the trust, in which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' mother, Euterpe, and his campaign chairman, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, are trustees, has holdings in 21 companies, including <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, several of the so-called `` Baby Bells'' spawned by the breakup of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. So, could <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> be called a millionaire? `` It's not accurate to say that, no,'' campaign spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Akey </PERSON> said. `` Potential, yes.'' It was during discussion last year over raising the governor's salary from $ 75,000 to an advisory board's recommendation of $ 125,000 that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> described himself as a `` man of few wants. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who eventually agreed to a $ 10,000 raise in governor's pay, balked at the board's further recommendation for a $ 25,000-a-year housing allowance, saying he could live on almost any salary, `` within reason.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> remains skeptical about government subsidies for overseas advertising of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm products, with an appropriations panel turning down a proposed $ 215 million increase for next year. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, calls Friday's vote by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> a `` victory for both the taxpayer and the small farmer.'' <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said he hopes `` this is the beginning of the end for huge handouts'' to agribusiness concerns for overseas advertising. `` If giant companies ... want to advertise their brands in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> they should n't ask the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayer to pay for it,'' he said. The Appropriations Committee's action held the program to its usual level of $ 110 million from a proposed level of $ 325 million for fiscal 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the program is part of an overall effort to make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm products more competitive overseas. It notes that American exports fell from $ 38 billion in 1984 to $ 26.3 billion two years later. The level crawled back up to $ 27.9 billion last year and is projected to hit $ 32 billion in 1988. A persistent critic of `` excesses'' in the agriculture budget, <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> prompted the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to conduct an investigation of the Targeted Export Assistance program. The congressional investigative agency said it found `` insufficient accountability and management controls'' in the program as well as an array of other problems. The TEA program was established by a voluminous 1985 law that put into place all of the nation's current major agricultural programs. Since 1986, it has supplied $ 110 million a year in <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> generic certificates to reimburse 66 organizations for promotion of a wide range of farm exports. The generic certificates are issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The certificates may be redeemed for their face value's worth of surplus crops held by CCC. The corporation acquires these goods primarily through federal programs under which farmers pledge their crops as collateral for price-support loans, with the option of forfeiting the commodities rather than taking them to market themselves. When the crops are transferred to another owner under an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> payment-in-kind program, such as Targeted Export Assistance, the amount of the original loan goes on <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> books as a `` realized loss.'' Pears, wheat, peaches, fruit cocktail, peas, lentils, grapes, apples, wood, poultry, eggs, soybean meal, dairy cattle, citrus, prunes, nuts, raisins, rice, potatoes, chocolate, red meat, pasta and cotton have all been the subject of overseas advertising supported by the Targeted Export Assistance program. The program is intended to give first crack at the money to products that have faced unfair foreign trade practices. TEA operates two kinds of programs. One subsidizes associations for generic advertising of specific <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products, such as `` American pears.'' The other pays private companies to promote not just `` American pears'' or `` American apples'' but farm products marketed under their brand names. Individual amounts can be substantial. <ORGANIZATION> Sunkist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, for example, received $ 7.93 million in fiscal 1986 and $ 9.55 million in fiscal 1987 for overseas promotion of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> citrus. At least $ 900,000 was allocated under TEA to promote <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tobacco exports, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> says an exporting group, <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, used money from the program to participate in a 1987 tobacco show in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and that this `` is paying off in greater contacts with the Chinese tobacco monopoly.'' `` Several new TEA activities are now planned with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, including sponsorship of a leaf grading school in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and reciprocal trade team visits between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' according to a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> should include stringent safeguards against abuse in the guidelines it used to launch a lengthy investigation of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration political opponents, says a former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> aide. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> said the bureau's investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in Solidarity with the People in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> from 1983 to 1985 was carried out under `` relatively lenient'' guidelines on foreign counterintelligence and international terrorism. The group opposes <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In prepared congressional testimony, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> said the probe could justifiably have been conducted under another set of guidelines, the `` relatively rigorous set of investigative rules'' governing domestic security and terrorism investigations. Details of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> surfaced in February. Internal <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> documents showed that agents investigated nuns, union members and college professors who opposed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policy, photographing protesters at peace rallies and recording license plate numbers. The investigation involved nearly all of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s field offices. The more lenient foreign counterintelligence guidelines allowed the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to conduct a much broader investigation than would have been possible under the domestic investigation guidelines. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> rework the international terrorism guidelines and apply some of the safeguards against abuse that are contained in the domestic security guidelines. The international guidelines permit investigations of entire organizations. Under the domestic standards, investigations must focus on participants who knowingly act to further criminal objectives. The domestic guidelines also specify that before investigations are opened, the danger to privacy and free expression posed by an investigation must be considered. `` If these standards had been conscientiously applied to the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> investigation, it seems certain that an ongoing intrusion into legitimate political activity would have ended much sooner,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, the attorney general's special assistant for intelligence during the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, made his remarks in testimony to be delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights. The investigation of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> began March 30, 1983, prompted by an informant's claim that members were covertly furnishing money and supplies to the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a leftist group seeking to seize power in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The probe was closed in June 1985 when the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> concluded that the group was involved in political activities protected by the First Amendment and was not participating in international terrorism.

<HEAD>`Greenhouse Effect' Could Trigger Flooding, Crop Losses,
Scientists Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE GOELLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of scientists is offering a sobering weather forecast for the year 2020: the planet's average temperature hitting a 10,000-year high, and the world's oceans surging an average of 83 feet inland. `` Things are going to change too fast,'' scientist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON> said as the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, released a report last week on the climate change that could be triggered by the `` greenhouse effect.'' The report painted a picture of a global civilization heating its atmosphere in a myriad of ways, from burning fossil fuel to destroying tropical forests. Those actions could force the average temperature up by 2 degrees Fahrenheit in the next three decades, the report says. That might not sound like much, but the scientists say it would be enough to wreak havoc. Such a temperature increase, for example, would cause the sea level to rise by 10 inches, bringing seawater an average of 83 feet inland, according to Oppenheimer. `` The potential for economic, political and social destruction is extraordinary,'' said biologist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodwell </PERSON>. To illustrate the warming trend, he noted that four of the hottest years in the last century have been recorded in the 1980s. The organization held four news conferences around the world, including one in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, to talk about the report. <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON> said even if mankind abruptly stopped adding excessive gases to the atmosphere, the delayed impact of already released gases would eventually raise the average temperature 1 to 2 degrees. The scientists' estimates are tied to an assumption that the Earth's population, industrialization and emissions will continue to grow along the upward curve that has been followed for the last 130 years. The report also gives a scenario tied to an assumption that worldwide growth and development could load the atmosphere with vastly increasing amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane and chlorofluorocarbons. In this case, the figures get two to three times worse: instead of a 10-inch increase in the sea level, the report estimates a 2-foot increase. Instead of a 2-degree increase in the average temperature, a 6-degree surge is called for. Oppenheimer says that temperature level last occurred 2 million years ago. Whatever the increases, the report paints a dismal picture for coastal areas: erosion of beaches, loss of wetlands, more frequent and more severe flooding, damage to port facilities. In its only cost estimate, the report said global expenditures of tens of billions of dollars will be needed over the next 50 years for dikes, walls and drainage systems to counter rising seas caused by already released gases. It forecasts destruction of forests and agricultural lands for the mid-latitudes, the heavily populated band that encompasses the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the southern half of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Forest loss is a critical element, because this releases still more carbon into the atmosphere. The report says the mid-latitude nations probably will be able to maintain food production but in different growing areas. Semi-arid tropical regions like northern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> would lose already marginal agricultural areas and face scarcities of fresh water and wood for fuel. Humid tropics would be wetter and warmer. In the high-latitudes like the northern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>, the scientists see melting ice packs and glaciers, more clouds and precipitation, the slow disappearance of permafrost and the possibility of large carbon releases from the soil. The report says that limiting the amount of global warming `` could be accomplished only with significant reductions'' in the use of fossil fuels like coal and petroleum. `` If reasonable economic growth rates are to be maintained, these reductions can be achieved only with two major changes: large -LRB- energy -RRB- efficiency increases of the order of one-half in industrial nations and rapid deployment of alternative energy sources,'' it said. The report also calls for reduced deforestation and increased forestation and implementation of last year's agreement among industrialized nations to decrease the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons. It cited the need for an international agreement `` on a law of the atmosphere'' to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, possibly setting long-term environmental targets to control the rate of temperature and sea level increases. The report warned against world leaders attempting to divide countries or regions into winners and losers in setting such targets. `` This is not a ` zero-sum' game,'' it said. `` Unless action is taken, it could be a negative-sum game of highly uncertain proportions.''

<TEXT>
 Southern Baptists mixed preaching and politicking as fundamentalists and moderates today approached a convention fight over control of the denomination's multimillion-dollar organizational empire A fundamentalist wing gradually has gained predominance among trustees of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> institutions through nine years of winning the influential presidency of the country's largest Protestant body But moderates think they can regain the office at the convention, which opens Tuesday. They cite numerous victories on the state level and various fundamentalist moves that have antagonized the grass-roots. Expected to be nominated for the presidency were the fundamentalist-backed Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vines </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and the moderate-backed Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. The president has appointive authority over trustees who run the 14.7-million-member denomination. Harsh words have been traded in the spiraling campaign recently, with fundamentalists demanding literalistic beliefs about the Bible among denominational teachers and agency staffers. Moderates defend a long-time Baptist concept of the `` soul competency'' of individuals to interpret the Bible as they understand it. A respected patriarch of the denomination, the Rev. <PERSON> Herschel </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON>, 80, of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, says the bitter struggle is hurting the Christian cause. `` In this controversy, we are our own worst enemies,'' <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON>, the former convention president, said in a statement. `` What all outside forces of evil could not do, we are doing to ourselves. As <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said in Galatians 5:15, we are like wild animals devouring one another. We deny the very oneness and peace for which <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> prayed.'' As a prelude to the convention, the thousands of `` messengers'' were offered a day of preaching, some of it from leading exponents of the two factions. So divided was sentiment that there were separate preaching arenas _ a Pastor's Conference of mainly fundamentalist speakers and the Forum for moderates. The Forum announced its 1988 Denominational Statesman Award to the Rev. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Lolley </PERSON>, driven by demands of newly ruling fundamenalist trustees to resign as president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. `` Trustees are no longer free to debate and decide issues,'' he said. `` They have people breathing down their necks to accomplish the pre-arranged agendas.'' He, along with four academic colleagues at the Wake Forest, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, seminary quit after trustees enacted measures requiring that faculty members profess that the Bible is free of error. `` The price which he has paid for his convictions is a witness to his faith, an act of judgment upon all those who surrender to the temptation to compromise their convictions,'' said the award citation. Among preachers scheduled at the Pastors Conference were fundamentalist former presidents, the Revs. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, a key strategist for that wing. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> denounces recent tactics of moderates accusing him of right-wing political ties, calling it `` hurtful misrepresentation, apparently born out of a willingness to do almost anything to reverse the conservative resurgence.'' Of moderate charges that he was involved in a rightist political group, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>, he says conservative Christians now simply are doing politically what liberals have done for a long time. `` It is no longer the left involved in isolation, but now the conservatives are involved,'' he said. `` What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.'' The Rev. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, who sent out the brochure criticizing <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> and others in the fundamentalist wing, said: `` There are some of our brethren who want to make all of us believe the same way they do. ... Our diversity has always been our greatest strength. Now they are telling us we can not be different any more.''

 Radicals attacked a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government office with firebombs and tear-gas bombs Monday in the southern city of <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, but caused only minor damage. Three men yelling anti-American slogans hurled three firebombs and two tear-gas bombs at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and police said. The three, who appeared to be students, were seized by police guards who stopped them with tear-gas guns.

The facility 150 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, which distributes information about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and organizes cultural events, was briefly evacuated. The attack followed a wave of violent anti-government and anti-U.S. protests during the past two weeks by radical students. They have been demanding the overthrow of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government and an end to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s alliance with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Anti-Americanism dominated the protests, with radical students claiming the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> enforces the partition of the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> so it can rule the south.

<HEAD>Drought Shriveling Crops, Driving Up Prices</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Drought across broad patches of the nation is shriveling crops and pastures, driving up grain prices and leaving some farm workers jobless. Community water use restrictions are in place in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and the Southeast. `` It's not total destruction for all these crops yet, but another week or two of dry weather is going to put us near the point of no return,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Grove </PERSON>, agricultural extension agent for <LOCATION> Seneca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. In addition, low water threatens to disrupt shipping on rivers in the South and hydroelectricity there and in the Northwest. These are the problem areas: _ Southeast: Parts of the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> have had below-normal rainfall for up to four years <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and six surrounding counties have water conservation programs. The hardest-hit reservoir is <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fontana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>, which is 45 feet below normal. Some private wells have gone dry in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. _ <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and northern Plains: A hot, dry spring and less than normal winter snow has left the soil so dry in some places that seeds did n't germinate Some farmers in northwestern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> have plowed crops under rather than spend more money on fertilizer. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> says the drought is the worst since the 1930s. Thunderstorms on Sunday produced much-needed rain over parts of the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> and northwestern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mobridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, got 1.47 inches of rain in six hours and <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, got 0.8 inch, but the region will need more rain to replace subsoil moisture. Areas of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> are restricting water use and residents in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> complain about dry wells, saying they suspect their neighbors of using all the water. Long Grove administrator D.M. <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said one woman's well ran dry while her neighbor across the street had three or four sprinklers going. `` It's kind of hard to love your neighbor,'' he said. The northern Plains' problem is shared by farmers in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wives </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, a 12-mile-wide expanse south of <LOCATION> Moose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION>, is bone dry for the first time since 1937. _ <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>: <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> have imposed mandatory water rationing in the wake of light winter snow in the mountains, where the snowpack is a natural reservoir Growers have been told that irrigation allotments may be cut. That lack of snow also has left hydroelectric reservoirs falling on the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, at the same time water must be released from those reservoirs to help migrating salmon. During the past month, the grain futures market in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> has surged upward as traders bet on smaller and smaller harvests. Soybean futures rose 25 percent during the past month and last week broke the $ 9-a-bushel barrier, highest since late 1983. Oats traded up by the daily limit _ 10 cents, raised to 15 cents at midweek _ on four of the five trading days last week. The market opened sharply lower Wednesday after reports that parts of west-central <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> got rain, with 5.2 inches at Coon Rapids and 1.79 at <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>. But other parts of the state stayed dry. The price of soybeans for July delivery closed slightly lower Friday on the strength of forecasts for rain early this week, but that was a decline of just 2 cents. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s statistical bureau said the state's pastures were at their June 1 driest since 1956. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> cited dry weather on the <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> in May when it reported that farmers were harvesting an estimated 1.57 billion bushels of winter wheat. That's slightly more than last year but 3 percent _ 50 million bushels _ less than a prediction issued a month earlier. `` Corn is just lying there. Not enough moisture to germinate it. Some early corn is barely surviving,'' said <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Peek </PERSON>, agricultural extension agent in <LOCATION> Buncombe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` Transplants of tobacco are dying. They stood there for a few days, and now they're starting to die. I never have known a spring like this and nobody you talk to has, either.'' The situation is acute for dairy farmers because grass to feed livestock is wilting or not growing as fast as usual, and they also depend on hay grown at this time of year to feed their animals in the winter. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is already allowing farmers to cut hay or let animals graze on land that was set aside for crop reduction or conservation in struggling counties in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Some farmers are selling cattle earlier than usual to avoid rising feed prices. `` Normally, we have two to three cuttings of alfalfa a year. The yield from the first cutting was way down and there wo n't be much of a second cutting,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Much of the state has had less than half normal rain this year. Hundreds of migrant workers who journey north to the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> along the upper <LOCATION> Minnesota-North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> border every year to thin and weed sugar beets are finding there's no work waiting for them.

 The anti-immigration <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has all but vanished from the legislature in nationwide elections, despite winning a stunning 14 percent of the vote in April's presidential balloting. In National Assembly elections two years ago, 35 members of the far-right party won seats. On Sunday, only one survived. But the Front was ambushed less by voters than by a new winner-take-all polling system. Not only did party leader <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> lose his seat, he also dropped $ 17,300 in a bet with a pollster whose organization predicted <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> would be defeated. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> called the election `` unfair and undemocratic,'' adding that it was unreasonable for a party that won 4 -LCB- million votes in April to be nearly shut out of the legislature in June. The Socialists, who won the presidency and took control of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in 1981, made it possible for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> to get into the Assembly when they changed the election law from a winner-take-all majority system to a proportional one. The majority system favors large parties. The proportional system, where seats are allotted on the basis of the percentage of votes won, is better for smaller parties. When the conservatives ousted the Socialists from power in the Assembly in 1986, they immediately voted back the majority system. `` We, unfortunately, predicted victory of the Socialist-Communist left, even though they are in a minority, because of the majority system of election which we fought,'' said <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Stirbois </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. `` The election system ... was conceived to eliminate the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>. `` And, on the whole, it achieved its objective, at least in Parliament.'' The National Front, vilified by the other political parties and accused of being racist and xenophobic for its anti-immigration platform, burst onto the political scene in 1984 by winning 11 percent of the vote in elections for a <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The party won 9.8 percent in 1986 legislative elections, not only entering the assembly for the first time, but surpassing 30 seats, the number needed to form a separate parliamentary political group. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>'s 14.4 percent performance in the 1988 presidential election was 2 -LCB- points above the most optimistic prediction. Though suffering a serious setback in this election, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> recorded at least one success. It brought traditional rightist parties into a deal for mutual support in several constituencies in recognition of its political strength. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> claimed this arrangement allowed the right to blunt what otherwise would have been a Socialist landslide. Carrying the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> standard will be only <PERSON> Yann </PERSON> <PERSON> Piat </PERSON>, who won re-election from a <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> district. Mrs. <PERSON> Piat </PERSON>, the wife of a naval officer, celebrated both her victory and her 39th birthday on Sunday. `` I am an ardent defender of a strong <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but a fierce adversary of uncontrolled immigration,'' she said.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in an interview with British broadcasters that he's not `` a razzle-dazzle performer'' but still hopes to unite Americans the way the late Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said in the interview broadcast Sunday that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had an unusual ability to bring blacks, Hispanics, the elderly and white ethnic communities together. `` People saw him as being somebody who cared about people everywhere _ and I'd like to think I'm that kind of person and that's the kind of leadership I want to bring to the presidency,'' he said in an interview on the Channel 4 television program `` The World This Week.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who was interviewed last week in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, appeared unconcerned about criticism that he lacks charisma. `` I must be doing something right if I've been able to come through this 15 months successfully,'' he said. `` I'm not a razzle-dazzle performer on the stage. I think I give a reasonably decent speech, but my strength is in working with people, in bringing people together, in my love of public service, in the importance that I place on building coalitions,'' he said. `` I think people are ready for somebody who comes to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, sure with warmth and feeling _ obviously I have that _ but with the ability to get the job done. And I think that's what the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are looking for. It's certainly my great strength and it's the reason that we've done as well as we've done,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Democratic nominee-to-be <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says as president, he would wage a `` real war on drugs'' _ something he says the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has failed to do. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was focusing on drug issues today. He had meetings set with leaders of his state anti-drug program and with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to discuss national efforts to fight drugs. A day earlier, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> to address the nation's mayors, and was harshly critical of the administration's dealings with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under indictment on drug charges If elected, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Sunday, he would tell the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies: `` Never again, never again are you going to bankroll a drug peddler who's poisoning our society and killing our children.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also chided <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for ignoring efforts by Latin American leaders to get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down. `` They tried to go it alone and they fell flat on their face,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of administration efforts to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would direct more foreign aid to anti-drug efforts, including support for drug-crop eradication and step up protection of officials in drug-producing nations who have `` the guts to join us in this war.'' He said the military should be prepared to assist those efforts. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> outlined a domestic anti-drug effort he said would include tougher drug laws and stiffer fines, property seizures and sentences, along with increased cooperation between federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. He called for expanded drug education for students and teachers, and guaranteed access to drug treatment. `` For us, the stakes are clear,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a speech well received by the mayors, a largely Democratic group. `` The war is on.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did not mention his certain Republican challenger, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, by name. But he attacked administration anti-drug efforts, in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> played a part when he headed an anti-drug task force. `` What we have today is chaos,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of the administration's anti-drug effort. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked up endorsements from more than 500 Democratic mayors and vice mayors. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a private gathering with several black mayors who support <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s presidential campaign.

<HEAD>New Herpes Virus May Aggravate Devastation Caused By AIDS</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-AIDS-Conference, Bjt</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 A newly discovered herpes virus may cause much of the damage to the immune system in people suffering from the deadly disease AIDS, a researcher says. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, one of the discoverers of the AIDS virus, said Sunday that the herpes virus works in concert with AIDS to attack the white blood cells that orchestrate the body's defenses against disease. He said the herpes virus can knock out the body's immune system more effectively than Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome once the AIDS virus has weakened the body's defense. The herpes virus appears to be harmless or to produce only very mild disease in otherwise normal healthy people, <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said at the opening session of the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>. `` Most of us in this room have been exposed to and probably infected with this virus'' while showing little or no sign of it, he said. The new herpes virus was discovered by researchers in <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>'s laboratory in 1986 It was initially called HBLV -LRB- for human B-cell lymphotropic virus -RRB- and is now referred to as HHV-6 -LRB- human herpes virus, type six -RRB-. This sixth human herpes virus, though related, is different from the herpes viruses that cause cold sores and genital infections. One of the principal targets of the AIDS virus is the T4 lymphocyte, a white blood cell that serves as the master orchestrator of the body's immune response to invading organisms. It appears, however, that the AIDS virus only infects a small percentage of T4 cells, yet it kills a very large percentage of them. There are a number of theories to explain how this might happen, but <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> proposed that the new herpes virus might be the answer. In studies in the test tube, the herpes virus is a more effective killer of T4 cells than is the AIDS virus, <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said. It can activate the dormant AIDS virus, and it is more common in AIDS patients _ and in such high-risk groups as homosexuals and drug abusers _ than it is in the population at large, <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said. The AIDS virus weakens the immune system allowing HHV-6 to enter, HHV-6 activates the virus and kills cells, producing further loss of immune defenses, and the deadly cycle continues. To prove that, <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> will have to do studies with animals, if he can find animals that are infected both by the AIDS virus and HHV-6, he said.

Her death leaves only two Shaker women in their 90s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, and up to eight in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Soule </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Topsham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. At age 11, she and her sister were placed with the Shaker community at <LOCATION> Sabbathday </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, after the death of their mother. She chose to remain with the community when she turned 21 and signed the Shaker vow of celibacy. In an interview this year, she said the vow was a challenge at times. `` Of course, when you're young you have high thoughts,'' she said. `` But you're living in a community where a lot of sisters and brothers are living a celibate life and you do n't think anything about it.'' Shakers believe <PERSON> God </PERSON> has a mission for everyone, she said. `` Whoever's mission it is to marry and bring new life into the world, that's their mission,'' she said. `` Our mission is to live as near as we can to Christ's teachings.'' In the early 1950s, <PERSON> Soule </PERSON> became an eldress, or spiritual leader, of the <ORGANIZATION> Sabbathday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. In 1957, she was appointed to the <ORGANIZATION> Lead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Believers </ORGANIZATION>. She moved to the village here in 1972 to assume further responsibilities as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Lead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, and served as vice president of the non-profit educational corporation and museum that administers the historic site founded in the 1780s. Her storytelling helped children visiting the museum understand the ways of the sect that's famous for its simple, efficient creations, including the flat broom, clothespin and ladderback chairs. Shakers once numbered 6,000 at 24 communities throughout the country. Now, the villages in <LOCATION> Canterbury </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sabbathday </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> are the only ones with Shakers. The Sabbathday Lake Shakers still admit new members, but the <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> village has admitted none since 1965. The <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> village has five members recognized by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> village and three whose membership is in dispute because of the 1965 decision not to admit newcomers. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> village once was a community of 400 men, women and children. <PERSON> Soule </PERSON>'s death leaves Sister <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, 92, and <PERSON> Eldress </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertha </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, 90, as the last Shakers at the village. Shakers, members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Believers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>'s Second Appearing, received their name from the trembling produced by religious emotions They lived communally and believed in a diety with male and female natures. The group began in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in 1747. Funeral services are planned Tuesday at the village Dwelling House Chapel.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane went off a runway after landing late Sunday at <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, and minor injuries were reported among the 82 people aboard, officials said.

 The city that boasts the highest average income in the country and attracts more tourists than <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> is preparing to celebrate the 75th anniversary of its sprouting from a lima bean field. And as one would expect from this capital of conspicuous consumption, the 14-month-long extravaganza will be on a grand scale, starting with a July 3 musical extravaganza, followed by an <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> special and a float in the Rose Parade. Former talk show host <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, who owns the <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, and singer <PERSON> Dinah </PERSON> <PERSON> Shore </PERSON> are the hosts of the musical, which will include performers <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Patten </PERSON>. Merchants also are getting into the act, as only <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> merchants can. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON>, one of its more exclusive jewelry stores, is crafting a slice of birthday cake iced with real diamonds, said to be worth millions of dollars. The Labor Day weekend 1989 grand finale will bring together the world's top fashion designers in what's touted as the world's largest fashion show More than 1,000 models will promenade along a 2 -LCB- - block runway down Rodeo Drive `` We want to attract as many people as possible,'' said event chairman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenimore </PERSON>, who estimated the 14-month celebration's cost at $ 1.6 million Throughout much of its history, <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, with its lavish mansions and fashionable boutiques, has attracted worldwide interest. `` It's just the fame of it,'' said tourist <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Doncaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` It's all very exciting. Most people know <LOCATION> Rodeo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drive </LOCATION>, even in our little town.'' The Los Angeles Visitors and <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> estimated that between 16 million and 18 million tourists last year ambled through the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>' downtown district, compared with 13 million at <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION>. No wonder <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> is celebrating. The average annual income in the 5.6-square-mile city is $ 125,000. There are more licensed gardeners per capita than in any other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city and more Rolls Royces per capita than in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. There are more than $ 8 billion in deposits at its 100 financial institutions, making it the nation's richest banking community after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. There's also a doctor for every 52 residents. <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> students watch from their football field as an oil derrick pumps black gold from the school's 17 oil wells. But what really separates <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> from other wealthy communties is it's association with the entertainment industry. In 1920, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON> built their legendary home, <LOCATION> Pickfair </LOCATION>, in the northern reaches of the city. The home has since been owned by <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakers </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Buss </PERSON> and most recently by <PERSON> Meshulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Riklis </PERSON> and his singer-wife, <PERSON> Pia </PERSON> <PERSON> Zadora </PERSON>. It all began in 1912 when developer <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> built a pink and green palace, the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Hotel, above a bridal path called <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>, on 12 acres of a lima bean field. The hotel was built at a then-staggering $ 500,000, today just a fraction of home prices in the city. It was, and still is, the focal point of the city's social life. In 1923, <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was inaugurated as the city's first honorary mayor there, and its famous polo lounge is the site of the ultimate power breakfast. In 1942, Billionaire <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> lived in four of the hotel's famous bungalows, two used as decoys from reporters <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, who filmed part of the 1946 classic `` It's A Wonderful Life'' at <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION>, moved here with his family in 1948. He often walks his two golden retrievers through his neighborhood. `` I wave to the tourist buses and sign people's maps to the star's homes,'' said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, who was honored by the five-member <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month as Man of the Year. `` A lot of people come up to me and say, ` That guy looks like <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>,''' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Patti </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Famiglia </ORGANIZATION> restaurant is a popular celebrity hangout. `` And I say, ` That IS <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>.''' All the hoopla aside, <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> is a thriving city of 33,000, known for its community-oriented government. New commercial developments are limited to three stories and fast food chains are banned. Its schools are among the nation's best, with 93 percent of its students going on to college `` I have great affection for <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. `` It's a city built for the benefit of the community itself, not just for a small group of celebrities.'' `` Some people say, ` Oh, you're just a snob from <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>,''' restaurateur <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> added. `` Well, they're just jealous.''

<HEAD>U.S. Embassy Cancels Terrorist Warning</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> has begun notifying <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> residents that they no longer need limit their movements to avoid a possible terrorist attack. On Thursday, the embassy warned the more than 1,500 Americans living in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to take precautions. The Chinese government had told it unidentified terrorists from a third country might attack <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens in the capital. On Sunday, the embassy canceled its warning after the Chinese assured <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials the danger was over. `` The Chinese government informed us today that it has taken effective action to ensure that persons who intended to harm American citizens will not be able to do so,'' Embassy spokesman <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said Sunday. Late Saturday, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement by the vice minister of public security, <PERSON> Gu </PERSON> <PERSON> Linfang </PERSON>, saying `` necessary measures'' had been taken and `` the problem has been solved.'' <PERSON> Gu </PERSON> did not elaborate. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Gu </PERSON> as saying that `` some persons recently attempted to harm Americans in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' but <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said he was not aware of any attempted attack. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said the Chinese government did not tell the embassy the nationality of the alleged plotters. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> who spoke on condition of anonymity said last week that there was Middle Eastern involvement. Several Western hotels increased their security staff in response to the warning. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> run by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and four other foreign governments blocked off its road and tightened security. The embassy also recommended that Americans avoid restaurants or bars known to be gathering points for Americans and avoid wearing clothing that clearly identified them as American. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials refused to say what steps were taken to increase security on the four compounds that house embassy offices and Ambassador <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON>'s residence.

<TEXT>
 As weeklong activities marking the millennium of Christianity in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> neared culmination, President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> pledged to allow religious freedom for Roman Catholics in this officially atheist country. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>'s statement, published Sunday in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda, came in response to a question from Cardinal <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Willebrands </PERSON>, a member of the largest <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> delegation ever to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. At the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Danilov </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monastery </LOCATION>, meanwhile, thousands of people celebrated a divine liturgy on one of the holiest dates on the Russian Orthodox calendar, known as `` Sunday of All the <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION> who Shone Forth in the Land of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>.'' The ceremony culminated a week of conferences, services and receptions commemorating 1,000 years of Christianity in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Willebrands </PERSON>, who heads the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s secretariat for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>, was among several foreign dignitaries in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the millennium who attended a Saturday meeting with <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>. `` Of course we are n't making any attempts to encroach on the rights of the Catholic church,'' Pravda quoted <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> as telling the cardinal. `` And likewise we are not trying to encroach on the rights of Catholics living in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> representative had asked whether it would be possible to organize <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches not only in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s Baltic republics, where a recognized church exists in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, but also in other parts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> where there are large <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> communities. He listed those areas as the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>. Those republics have no fully recognized <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches, and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> wants the right to appoint bishops there, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said. Pravda's report of the question, taken from a <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> dispatch, omitted the specific references to the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, reflecting the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s sensitivity on the issue. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches could be opened outside the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> states if local authorities agree. `` In the future, we will give the necessary attention to the wishes of Soviet Catholics, regardless of where they live,'' the 78-year-old president told the prelates. Though officially atheist, the government supports the Russian Orthodox Church and has exhibited greater religious tolerance in the three years <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been in power. <PERSON> Willebrands </PERSON> met Friday with clergy of the underground Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> ordered absorbed into the Russian Orthodox church in 1946 during a massive campaign of religious repression. Ukrainian clerics say there are between 3 million and 4 million Ukrainian Catholics in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> said in a letter in April to Ukrainian Catholics that their church should be fully recognized. The Russian Orthodox Church bitterly opposes recognition of the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, claiming it was formed only as a result of a forced split in the <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> at the end of the 16th Century.

<HEAD>Vietnam Retiring 70 Army Generals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is retiring more than 70 army generals and about 3,000 colonels this month as part of its policy of reducing one of the world's largest armies, a Vietnamese newspaper editor said today. <PERSON> Bui </PERSON> <PERSON> Tin </PERSON>, a deputy editor in chief of the official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Nhan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dan </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- The People -RRB-, said younger officers will fill some vacated posts but other posts will be eliminated. Many of the officers have stayed on despite having passed retirement age, he said. Some of the retiring officers, including the commander in chief of Vietnamese forces in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, will return home when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> begins withdrawing troops from that country later this month, Tin told reporters in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. He declined to name the commander. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said it will withdraw 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> this year as part of its plan for a total withdrawal by 1990. It says the entire military command will be transferred to the pro-Vietnamese Cambodian government. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978. By <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimate, it maintains 120,000 troops there to combat guerrillas. Vietnamese officials have said their army must be reduced so resources can be concentrated on economic development, which the party has set as the country's top priority. Tin compared the campaign to a simultaneous effort to streamline the government to promote greater efficiency. According to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s army of 1.1 million men is tied with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> as the world's third largest, behind <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Tin noted that as a proportion of the total population, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s army is much larger than that of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s serious unemployment problem will worsen as soldiers return to civilian life.

 Three minutes and 2 -RCB- pounds of pink tomatoes later, 10-year-old <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Orton </PERSON> was the newly crowned champion of the annual tomato eating contest at the <LOCATION> Bradley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Pink Tomato Festival. `` I'm hungry. I did n't eat since dinner last night,'' <PERSON> Orton </PERSON> said before chomping and chewing his way past two-time defending champion <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> and two other adults Saturday for the title and the $ 50 prize. <PERSON> Orton </PERSON>, of Hermitage, was the first contestant to take his seat before a heap of tomatoes, and he listened attentively as the referee explained the rules, including the three-minute time limit. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who won last year by tossing down more than 5 pounds of tomatoes, had been the odds-on favorite to repeat this year. He said before the contest that he did not feel well. He came out slow and finished in a three-way tie for second place with <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisener </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dallas </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` I think it messed me up on tomatoes,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who works in a tomato shed, said of the experience.

He paused at intervals during the contest and used his T-shirt to wipe tomato juice from his chin. More than 20,000 people attended this year's festival, which also featured the popular all-tomato luncheon, where every item on the menu except coffee and tea had tomatoes as an ingredient.

 Fast talking and an eye for cattle paid off for a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> man who beat out 65 other livestock auctioneers to win the $ 1,000 prize at the 25th annual World Livestock Auctioneeer Championship. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Pogue </PERSON> of Sulphur Springs also took home a championship ring. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Welschmeyer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, was reserve champion, followed by <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Teply </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, in the contest sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Livestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The contestants Saturday each sported their own particular calling style, ranging from low-key and straightforward to flashy and loquacious. And they did run on. `` Here they come. They're good ones,'' called <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinwoodie </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, as a group of cattle was driven into the ring. `` Look at the legs on'em. The quality's here. Just the way you want to buy'em, fellas.'' <PERSON> Dinwoodie </PERSON>, a former winner in the world all-around competition, said his natural propensity to babble led him into livestock selling. `` I grew up in <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> on a ranch. I was kind of a mouthy kid, and one day my dad and uncle said, ` Why do n't you be an auctioneer?''' The tricky part of selling livestock, auctioneers say, is keeping a close eye on buyers, whose bidding motions sometimes merely resemble nervous tics. `` The bidders out here today have been super,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Smiths </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, one of 15 finalists. `` When they bid you can really see it. Sometimes you get the eye winkers and finger wigglers.'' Along with sharp eyes, auctioneers have to talk fast and still be understood, and that takes practice. Many participants attended auction school, but they said practice makes perfect. `` I practice while I'm driving,'' said <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxley </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Robles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, another finalist. `` Some people sing or talk to themselves while driving _ I practice selling.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new test can distinguish infants infected by the AIDS virus from those who only appear infected because they carry blood proteins from their mothers, a study suggests. The test works by detecting genetic material from the virus, rather than the standard method of detecting the proteins as evidence of possible infection, scientists said. The proteins, called antibodies, form in reaction to exposure to the AIDS virus. A mother's antibodies can pass to the fetus and make the infant appear to have been exposed to the virus when standard testing is used. The study, led by <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolinsky </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, is to be reported this week in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> at the Fourth International Conference on AIDS. It used a `` polymerase chain reaction'' technique, called PCR, to detect genetic material from the virus causing acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Part of the test focused on nine children, ages 6 months to 3 years, who had tested positive by standard tests. Three tested negative by PCR and later were shown to be free of the virus. The six others, scored positive by PCR, later showed other signs of infection. In a different group of five children who had tested positive by standard tests, three scored positive by the PCR test and later showed other evidence of infection. The two others, who tested negative with PCR, were found to be free of the virus. Five children who tested negative by standard tests also scored negative with PCR. A second study by <PERSON> Wolinsky </PERSON> and colleagues confirmed other demonstrations that PCR can detect infection in adults before they test positive on antibody-based tests. Tests of stored blood samples suggested that 16 of 18 men who tested positive on a standard antibody test would have tested positive at least six months earlier with a PCR test. For one man, the difference was 42 months, researchers said.

 Attackers yelled anti-American slogans and hurled firebombs and tear-gas bombs at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government office in a southern city today, officials said. The attack on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, 150 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, caused no casualties and only minor damage. The attackers tossed three firebombs and two tear-gas bombs at the office, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and police said. Three attackers, believed to be students, were seized by police guards who stopped them with tear-gas guns. Up to 10 radicals were involved in the attack, according to news reports. Six windows were broken and the center's sign set on fire in the attack, officials said. The center, which promotes information about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and organizes cultural events, was briefly evacuated. The attack followed a wave of violent anti-government and anti-U.S. protests during the past two weeks by radical students who have been demanding the overthrow of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government and an end to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s alliance with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Anti-Americanism dominated the protests, with radical students claiming the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> enforces the partition of the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> so it can rule the south. The radicals want immediate reunification with the communist north and removal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in the south under a mutual defense pact. The two Koreas, divided since 1945, are bitter enemies. The north invaded the south in 1950 to launch the Korean War. The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, have failed to attract public support.

<HEAD>Jetliner Crashes In Fog In Northeastern Argentina; 22 Presumed

<DATELINE>POSADAS, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Investigators will study flight data to find out why a DC-9 jetliner on a domestic flight crashed in heavy fog near a northeastern airport, apparently killing all 22 people aboard. <ORGANIZATION> Austral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> said 15 passengers and a crew of seven were aboard the private carrier's plane, which on Sunday crashed into a grove of eucalyptus trees about a half-mile short of the Posadas airport. The plane had left <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> Sunday morning, stopping first in the river port city of <LOCATION> Resistencia </LOCATION> before heading north for Posadas, the capital of <LOCATION> Misiones </LOCATION> province, which is about 650 miles north of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. The airline statement said Flight 046 crashed `` for unknown reasons.'' It added, `` Given the magnitude of the accident, it is presumed there are no survivors.'' Intense heat at the crash site initially prevented recovery of all the bodies. A Misiones radio station said the plane's black box was found in the wreckage and investigators hoped the device that records flight data will help them determine the cause of the crash. Local news reports indicated the jetliner made an abrupt turn while approaching the airport runway three miles outside Posadas, stalled in the air and then crashed. `` We flew over the crashed plane a little after the accident and fire consumed everything in 10 minutes,'' said <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, civil aviation director of <LOCATION> Misiones </LOCATION> province. Witnesses and firefighters at the scene said the air was filled with the smell of burning eucalyptus and that wreckage from the charred DC-9 was strewn across a large area. Austral released a list of the people on board that indicated most were Argentine, but one passenger identified only as <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> was also listed in the flight manifest. Austral is a private carrier purchased last year from the state. It competes with the government carrier <ORGANIZATION> Aerolineas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Argentinas </ORGANIZATION> on domestic routes. Austral had been taken over by the state earlier this decade because of financial troubles.

<HEAD>Strong Earthquake Breaks Windows, Knocks Kids Off Their Feet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A strong earthquake that broke windows, emptied supermarket shelves and knocked children off their feet was one of the strongest temblors to hit the quake-prone region in years, authorities said. The earthquake, felt over a 350-mile area from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rosa </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, was the sharpest of at least three measurable temblors in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Sunday. There were no reports of serious injuries or damage. `` We got rocked and rolled pretty good,'' said police dispatcher <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Mraz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Milpitas </LOCATION>, 10 miles west of the quake's center. The quake registered 5.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, according to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey in <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> recorded it at 5.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion. Ceilings cracked, a water pipe burst and burglar alarms sounded in the area closest to the epicenter, and nervous residents rushed into the street in at least one neighborhood and jammed phone lines throughout the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. One man said he saw parked cars moving in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Presidio </LOCATION> base in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The quake hit at 6:45 p.m. and was centered on the <LOCATION> Calaveras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fault </LOCATION> about 10 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, near unincorporated Alum Rock. Both seismographic centers recorded several small aftershocks Sunday night, and <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> center spokesman <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> warned that another temblor of up to magnitude 4 was likely. Experts expressed concern because the 5-mile-long epicenter was just north of the center of a destructive quake that hit <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> in 1984, registering 6.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, the region's strongest temblor in years Sunday's quake's shallow epicenter increased its impact on the area, experts said. Two children in <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION>, 10 miles north of the epicenter, said they were knocked to the floor and suffered mild bruises when the ground began to ripple. `` It still hurts when I walk,'' said 5-year-old <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Harang </PERSON>, whose 12-year-old sister <PERSON> Chrissy </PERSON> also took a fall. In <LOCATION> Milpitas </LOCATION>, the quake knocked dozens of boxes, cans and bottles off the shelves of at least one supermarket and further cracked a window damaged in an earlier quake. `` We got off pretty easy,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the night manager. `` I've lived in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> all my life, so I'm blase about earthquakes. I thought, ` Here we go again.''' Earlier Sunday, an earthquake registering 3.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale jolted <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Solano </LOCATION> counties in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and a quake measuring 3.4 hit the inland area of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> around <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> temblor was the second widely felt quake to hit <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> since Friday, when a shaker measuring 5.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale hit 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and was felt in much of central and southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in the strenth of the shaking. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage.

 A Japanese teen-ager was arrested after he tried to sneak explosives, a dismantled rifle, a pellet gun and dummy hand grenades aboard an airplane, authorities said. Sunday morning's discovery of the weapons in the youth's luggage led authorities to close and evacuate one of five terminals at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> for several hours. <PERSON> Yoshino </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosugi </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, was charged with attempting to board an aircraft with firearms, explosives or incendiary devices, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kundts </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kosugi </PERSON>, a student at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was scheduled to appear before a federal magistrate today, <PERSON> Kundts </PERSON> said. Upon conviction, the maximum sentence for the charge is five years in prison and a $ 25,000 fine. <PERSON> Kosugi </PERSON> collects military paraphernalia, said <PERSON> Kundts </PERSON>. `` Contact with foreign authorities had determined at this time no known association with a terrorist organization,'' <PERSON> Kundts </PERSON> said. Police detained <PERSON> Kosugi </PERSON> shortly after he tried to check in at the last minute for an early morning <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said Detective <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Kosugi </PERSON>'s baggage was examined, the rifle and grenades were found along with the pellet gun, carbon dioxide cartridges, fireworks and flares, police Capt. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Puchalski </PERSON> said. Also found was explosive black powder and some unspecified ammunition that police were checking to determine whether it was live, he said. Police bomb squad officers were called in and ordered the evacuation of the terminal, <PERSON> Puchalski </PERSON> said. Departures were delayed, but after nearly 3 -LCB- hours, the terminal began operating normally, he said. <PERSON> Kundts </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kosugi </PERSON> was in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on a student visa, but he did not know if <PERSON> Kosugi </PERSON> was leaving the country permanently.

 CBS President <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> admits making mistakes that led to the network's slump to third place in the ratings, but vows to make changes to return it to the top spot. `` I have heard your concerns and disappointments loud and clear,'' <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> said at Sunday's opening session of the three-day <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliates conference. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> fell to third place in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings last season for the first time in its history. `` We share your disappointment with our prime-time ratings last season,'' he said. `` We will not settle for third or even second place. Our highest priority is to restore CBS to No. 1. We will use every resource and we are committed to that goal.'' <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> said the network would improve programming and the promotion of that programming. `` We must be more aggressive in bringing our programming to the attention of the public through promotion,'' he said, adding that the network was putting new people in charge of on-the-air promotion. Asked to identify an area where he had specifically made a mistake, <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> said he felt he should not have encouraged the entertainment division to drop the Tuesday night movie and put in a block of four comedies. `` I think if we had not done that and I had not encouraged them to do that, we would not have ended up in third place,'' he said. In addition to its ratings woes, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> has been beset by programming delays resulting from the 14-week writers' strike, news budget cuts and buyout rumors. `` There is one thing I want to make clear,'' said <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, who is also chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Loews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Despite rumors, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Loews </ORGANIZATION> stock is not for sale. The network is not for sale.'' The estimated 800 people attending the luncheon burst into applause. <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> said he believed the price tag of $ 243 million for the 1992 Winter Olympics was a smart investment. He said he had been criticized for the bid but said it was the first time anyone had accused him of overspending. `` We have seen how two weeks of Olympic coverage can raise an entire network and boost the ratings of its schedule,'' he said. <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> said he did n't plan to put <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> into the cable business, as <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> are, saying he felt `` the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public would be better served by strengthening over-the-air broadcasting.''

<TEXT>
 An anti-gang task force of 1,000 police officers arrested 1,524 people, more than half of them gang members, and seized guns, drugs and cars in a weekend crime crackdown throughout the city, police said. The anti-gang task force, code-named `` The Hammer,'' was concentrated in south-central <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, though officers made several arrests in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` We will do it as often as we can, as often as we think it will be productive and effective,'' police spokesman Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said Sunday. Police confiscated at least 217 grams of cocaine, 551 grams of marijuana, nearly $ 5,000 in cash and impounded 220 vehicles during the two-night raid Friday and Saturday night, Officer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> said. Along with rock cocaine and the drug PCP, several weapons also were confiscated, including an AK-47 assault rifle. Smaller sweeps, using as many as 250 officers, have become regular weekend fixtures since January, when police began an aggressive crackdown on the city's 70,000 street gang members. The actions are major skirmishes in what Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> calls a war on `` the rotten little cowards,'' and followed the release of a department report showing gang slayings had risen 20 percent this year. The report cited 96 gang-related killings in the city through the end of May, compared to 80 a year ago. In all of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> there have been 138 gang-related killings this year. In 1987, there were 387 gang slayings. The report, however, showed a 3.5 percent decrease in gang-related murders in south-central <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> following the added police presence. Gang killings in the region patrolled by the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Ddepartment rose 6 percent over the same period, a sheriff's spokesman said. During the sweep, officers also gathered intelligence, filling out hundreds of field identification forms of suspected and known gang members to help them in future police work.

 New AIDS cases are being reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the rate of one every 14 minutes and an estimated 365,000 cases will have been reported by 1992, the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government figures show. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, director of the AIDS program at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said today that it is difficult to tell whether the AIDS epidemic is leveling off. But he also said that, in his view, that is not a very important question. `` We had a thousand cases reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week,'' he said in an interview during the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. `` Does it matter whether it's going up or not? `` It might level off like lung cancer or heart disease _ and that's not good,'' <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> added. He said an increasing number of people are contracting AIDS through heterosexual contact in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but that no explosive increases in heterosexual spread of AIDS are likely. `` The data is too incomplete for firm conclusions,'' <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, 12,221 cases of AIDS have been reported as of March 31, more than double the number reported a year earlier, <PERSON> Jean-Baptiste </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunet </PERSON> of <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, said today. AIDS among drug abusers is increasing rapidly in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, he said. An estimated 300,000 to 800,000 people in 30 European countries are now believed to be infected with the AIDS virus, <PERSON> Brunet </PERSON> said. On Sunday, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s AIDS program told the conference's opening session that as many as several hundred million people around the world may be at risk of getting AIDS, which is now present in virtually every country in the world. `` No country is immune,'' Dr. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said. `` We do not _ we can not _ have precise numbers, but it is likely that several hundred million people around the world may have behaviors which make them potentially vulnerable to infection with HIV,'' said <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, one of 7,000 scientists and doctors attending the largest AIDS conference ever held. He estimated that 150,000 people will develop AIDS in 1988, doubling in one year the estimated number of cases in the history of the epidemic. In other developments, researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> reported that a widely used AIDS drug appears to dramatically reverse the devastating effects of the disease on the brains of children. Dr. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzo </PERSON> said children who have lost their speech as the result of AIDS infection in the brain subsequently recovered their ability to talk and other functions of the brain. <PERSON> Pizzo </PERSON>'s study of 21 AIDS-infected children aged 14 months to 21 years showed that their IQ scores rose about 15 points after they took AZT, the only drug that has been shown to help delay the onset and severity of AIDS symptoms. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> painted a grim picture of the AIDS epidemic but noted that the world has never seen a mobilization of the kind that has been mounted to fight the deadly disease. As an example of the ferocity with which AIDS can spread among drug abusers, <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> described the situation in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. Two years ago, virtually no one in the city had antibodies to the AIDS virus. The presence of AIDS antibodies indicates an individual has been infected with the virus. In 1987, 1 percent of the population had antibodies to AIDS. In the first three months of this year, the infection had spread to 16 percent of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>'s population. `` This epidemic curve _ already documented in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> _ threatens every community of IV -LRB- intravenous -RRB- drug users in the world,'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said. `` AIDS is changing the world,'' he said. `` It has become a key part of the history of our time.'' The number of AIDS cases officially reported to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> stood at 96,433 as of June 1. The number of actual cases is now estimated to be 200,000, <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said. Although AIDS was not identified until 1981, the origins of the epidemic have been traced back to the 1970s, the time of what <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> calls `` the silent pandemic.'' `` A virus spread across the world, and we did n't even know it existed ... It is _ or should be _ shocking to our modern pride that such a global expansion could occur without even being detected,'' he said. Participants in the four-day conference were scheduled to make about 3,600 presentations, but no breakthroughs were expected in ways of curing or preventing the deadly virus. AIDS damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

 Thunderstorms rumbled across the Midwest today, bringing much-needed rain but flooding parts of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and pelting some areas with hail. A high pressure system kept much of the nation dry. Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from northwest <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> through western parts of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> into eastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> late Sunday and early today.

 Singer <PERSON> Dionne </PERSON> <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON> brought together her show business friends in a benefit concert that capped a weekend of events organizers expect to raise $ 1 million for AIDS education. The four-hour, $ 100-a-seat concert at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for the Performing Arts Sunday night reunited Ms. <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> for a live rendition of their hit song, `` That's What Friends Are For'' _ a plea for help in the fight against the deadly virus. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> was to have joined the stars on stage, but son <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told the audience the singer had `` taken ill'' and would not perform. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warwick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Betts </PERSON>, declined to specify the nature of <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>'s illness, but said he would not be hospitalized. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>'s publicist, said from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> only that <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> was returning to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON>, who organized weekend events that included a special dinner and AIDS education workshops, cried as she made an plea for more funds to educate the public about AIDS. `` We've got a big fight on our hands,'' she told the audience. `` And we know that with the help of people like you, we're going to win that fight.'' <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON> made the longest trip for the benefit, arriving Sunday after performing Saturday at the FreedomFest anti-apartheid concert in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` That is what friends are for,'' Wonder said of his cross-Atlantic journey to stand with Ms. <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Betts </PERSON> said ticket sales for the concert, a sale of rights to the concert to cable television and other proceeds should bring the weekend's receipts to close to $ 1 million. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its forces broke through <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> defenses east of the southern port city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> today, killing or wounding 4,000 Iraqis nearly three weeks after the Iraqis drove them out of the region. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said fierce fighting was raging in the <LOCATION> Salamcheh </LOCATION> region, with the Iranians `` holding the upper hand'' in a two-pronged offensive. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said the Iranians had crossed the border in what it called a `` reckless assault'' at the deserted police posts at <LOCATION> Bubiyan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Suwadi </LOCATION> 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>. An <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military spokesman, who can not be identified under military regulations, told reporters in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> that the Iraqis' 3rd <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> `` absorbed the momentum'' of the offensive and contained it He acknowledged fighting was still going on east of <LOCATION> Fish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, an area flooded by the Iraqis several years ago to block Iranian thrusts. The spokesman said the Iraqis were preparing a counter-offensive `` that will teach the enemy a good lesson.'' He did not elaborate. There was no independent confirmation of either sides' claims. The two nations rarely allow correspondents or other observers into the combat zones. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian troops punched through <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> defenses, destroying 30 Soviet-made tanks, decimating three infantry brigades and then overrunning three artillery battalions, setting ammunition dumps on fire. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> correspondents with the Iranian assault force reported that thick black smoke from the burning Iraqi depots billowed over the battlefield. The agency reported that several hours after the offensive was launched, a half-dozen other Iraqi infantry brigades had suffered 25 to 40 percent casualties. It made no mention of Iranian losses. The agency said the battlefield was littered with knocked-out tanks and armored vehicles and that more than 700 Iraqis were captured, including several senior officers. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian artillery was pounding Iraqi positions behind the lines to block reinforcements reaching the hard-pressed frontline units. The offensive was the first major Iranian operation announced in the strategically important southern sector since May 25. At that time, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers pushed the Iranians out of a hard-won bridgehead east of the southern port city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> in a lightning offensive that apparently caught the Iranians by surprise. The Iranians had seized marshlands east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> with severe losses in early 1987 and battled to within six miles of the city before they were blocked by Iraqi defenses. The loss of the <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> bridgehead was <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s second battlefield defeat in five weeks. The Iraqis had recaptured the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> on April 18, ending two years of Iranian occupation. The Iranians, jolted by loss of their two main footholds on Iraqi soil, had been expected to launch a retaliatory offensive in an attempt to regain military initiative in the nearly 8-year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, seeking to restore <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s military fortunes, appointed <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as acting commander-in-chief of the armed force on June 2. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said at the time that <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s appointment as military leader was expected to herald `` new victories on the battlefield.'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s appointment climaxed a shuffle of military commanders that followed the loss of <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> on April 18, the same day that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sank or crippled six Iranian naval craft in a series of clashes in the gulf.

<TEXT>
 A judge today rejected a bid to reopen the trial of the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six, and the blacks convicted for a mob murder once again faced hanging unless President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> intervenes. The judge gave the defendants 35 days to appeal to <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> or the chief justice. The president already has turned down an appeal for clemency. In doing so, he spurned an international campaign to spare the six, who were found guilty in the mob killing of a black town councilor. <ORGANIZATION> Pretoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Human </PERSON>, who presided over the original trial in 1985, rejected an application by defense lawyers to reopen the case to consider allegations that police coerced two state witnesses. The defendants _ five men and a woman _ were convicted of complicity in the 1984 death of black town councilor who was stoned to death and burned during riots provoked by a rent increase. Human, who had granted a stay of execution hours before the six were to hang in March, said today the request to review the case was `` frivolous and absurd.'' But he extended the stay of execution, which would have expired today, until July 19, giving defense attorneys 35 days to appeal once again to <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and ask Acting Chief Justice <PERSON> P.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rabie </PERSON> to overrule the court's decision. However, Human indicated he felt the chief justice would not overturn his decision by telling the lawyers that their only remaining hope lay in petitioning <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> again. Several dozen friends, relatives and diplomats crowded into the courtroom did not react immediately to the reading of the decision, but some broke down and wept in the corridor when attorney <PERSON> Prakesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Diar </PERSON> explained the ruling to them. They then went to <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> prison to visit the six convicts. <PERSON> Diar </PERSON> said, `` It's a bit surprising that he would give a time limit'' on when the chief justice would have to make a decision. `` Our experience when you petition the chief justice -LRB- is that -RRB- it takes many months. He's giving us a deadline for the chief justice to make up his mind. I think I'm losing a little extra hope with the judge's attitude.'' Human said apart from allegations that two witnesses were coerced, there was ample uncontested evidence to implicate all six defendants and he would not extend the stay of execution beyond July 19. <PERSON> Diar </PERSON> said he would try to appeal to the chief justice. But he said the fate of the six was really in <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s hands. `` I hope and I pray that the state president will reconsider his previous decision. This is a politically related case. -LRB- <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s decision -RRB- may be based on political considerations. <PERSON> Diar </PERSON> said he spoke to his clients last week and described them as `` hopeful, but not confident.'' Prosecutors argued during a hearing last week that Human had no jurisdiction to reopen the case because an appeal has been rejected by the country's highest court, the <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Defense lawyers had said Human could reopen the case if he determined the trial court was defrauded by false evidence obtained through coercion. But Human said today that further questioning of a state witness who recanted part of his incriminating testimony would be `` an exercise in futility.'' The six were granted a stay of execution March 17, one day before they were to hang. Their case has generated controversy in part because they were not convicted of contributing physically to the councilor's death. They were convicted under the doctrine of common purpose, which held them responsible because they actively participated in the mob which killed the councilor. The government has contended that the six have been unfairly portrayed abroad as innocent victims of an unjust law. Authorities say evidence at the trial showed that each played an active part in the killing, through such actions as making firebombs to burn the victim's house and slapping a woman who pleaded for the councilor's life The defendants are <PERSON> Mojalefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sefatsa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokoena </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oupa </PERSON> <PERSON> Diniso </PERSON>, <PERSON> Duma </PERSON> <PERSON> Khumalo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokhesi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramashamola </PERSON>, the only woman on Death Row for what activists say is a politically related crime. Through the policy of apartheid, the white minority government has established a racially segregated society and denies the country's 26 million blacks a vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. Black officials in the government's employ are thus often resented by other blacks.

<HEAD>Budget Director Says Deficit Will Likely Exceed Forecast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Budget Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said today that this year's federal deficit will likely be greater than the administration had forecast, forcing automatic spending cuts unless new ways are found to slash spending. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said greater spending on such things as savings and loan bailouts and lower tax revenues will push the budget gap higher than the $ 146 billion threshold that would force cuts under the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law. `` I'm afraid its about to fall,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, speaking on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' program, said of Gramm-Rudman's automatic budget-cutting ax `` We're going over in spending and some of the receipts are a little bit short so it looks like unless we do something it'll fall,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, director of the presidential <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> The budget blueprint worked out earlier this year by congressional leaders and the administration projects a $ 135.3 billion deficit next year, barely below the $ 136 billion target of the Gramm-Rudman law for fiscal 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> had offered more pessimistic forecasts for the budget, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> used figures provided by the White House in projecting the deficit. `` When we sent the budget up, the bipartisan budget agreement did n't leave very much margin for error at all,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said today. `` The problem is that if we just tip over at all, that'll trigger the cuts. He said the administration's figuring had assumed revenues that have actually been depressed because of lower inflation than the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had foreseen and `` we have some spending that's up. For example, bailing out thrift institutions _ that's going to cost more money.'' The government last week paid out a record $ 1.35 billion to investors in two failed <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> savings and loans. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the Gramm-Rudman law would force cuts of 3 -LCB- percent in domestic programs and 8 percent in defense spending unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> comes up with other cuts by Oct. 1. `` By law we have to make these determinations,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` We do n't want those cuts; I do n't think anybody wants those cuts.'' `` A concern is there are a number of threats up there, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has got a number of bills it's trying to pull out of the hopper. ... And when you're right there at the margin, it looks like we're going to have to do these across-the-board cuts, we can not afford to have that increased spending. He said the budget gap was not enough to warrant more taxes, however. `` I just do n't think at this point we really need to have a tax increase,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A Palestinian suspected of placing bombs aboard two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jetliners that killed five people will be tried in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> on charges of entering <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> on a forged passport, a security official said today. The Palestinian, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, 34, has been held at <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> security police headquarters since a tip from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> led to his arrest June 1 at <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is seeking <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>'s extradition for his alleged involvement in the bombings of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jets over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in 1982 and over <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in 1986. `` We understand that <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> is to be tried for coming into <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> with false travel documents. The question of his extradition therefore does n't arise at this stage,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. According to police, <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> entered <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> on a fake Syrian passport. If convicted, he could receive an 18-24 month sentence for traveling on forged documents, the security official said. `` Under normal practice, it would be possible for extradition proceedings to be started after he has finished serving the prison term,'' the security official said. The official said he was not aware that any date had been set for <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>'s trial. In the crowded <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> judicial system, suspects may be held for up to 10 months before their case is heard. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> has followed similar procedures in the past when faced with extradition requests for alleged terrorists. A Jordanian arrested in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in 1982 is still awaiting extradition to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, where he is wanted for allegedly plotting an attack against the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> synagogue that killed a small boy. <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, believed to be an explosives expert, is suspected of placing a sophisticated device that went off aboard a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jet on a Rome-Athens flight in April 1986 as it flew over southern <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. Four people, including a baby, died when they were blasted out of the aircraft. <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> also allegedly placed a bomb aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet that exploded as the plane was coming in to land at <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> on a flight from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in 1982. A Japanese teen-ager was killed and 15 passengers were injured.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are likely to face a tight race for the White House this fall, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is off to a fast start in some traditionally Republican states, according to a 50-state <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey. Democrats around the country expressed optimism about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' chance to end eight years of Republican rule in the White House Republicans in the survey said the contests shapes up as a close one, but several officials added that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could win easily if he succeeds in his attempt to depict <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as an heir to the Democratic party's recent liberal past. The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> survey included recent public opinion polls and interviews with independent political analysts and party officials in all 50 states. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, leads in the polls in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, both of which last voted Democratic in 1964. He is running even with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the polls in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, which gave President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> his largest majorities in 1980 and 1984. One survey shows him even in reliably Republican <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, and within striking distance in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, key Southern states. Said Democratic Chairwoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchioro </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, `` This is the best shot we've had in a long, long time.'' The last time a Democrat carried her state in a presidential election was 1968. `` I think it will be the closest presidential contest we've had since 1976,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> state chairman in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> has n't voted for a Democrat in a presidential campaign since 1964. Republicans have won four of the last five presidential elections, with <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s victory in 1976 the only exception. While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leads in nationwide public opinion polls, there is agreement that political fortunes in the five months until the election will be influenced by factors such as selection of a vice presidential running mate, campaign debates and the health of the economy. Republicans say <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lead is a temporary result of favorable publicity in recent weeks from his string of primary victories against <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` Nobody has laid a glove on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' says <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> party director <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>. `` That's going to change once the conventions are over. We have n't been able to start hitting on him.'' For now, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lead nationally is reflected in poll results around the country and optimism among Democratic officials in states from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. _ He leads <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by double digits in polls in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the largest state with 47 electoral votes, which last voted for a Democrat in 1964. He is also viewed as the leader in both <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which last went <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> in 1968, and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, which last voted that way in 1964. _ Polls in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> indicate the two men are running even. Neither state has backed a Democrat in a presidential race since 1964, and <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officials in both states express confidence that wo n't change this time. _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> holds leads in polls in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is well within striking distance and officials in both parties say the race could be influenced by vice presidential running mates. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is perceived as running generally well across the South. `` I sense a strong base of support for Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'' in the South, says <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, political director of the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` But Republicans in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> realize how close this election can be.'' Officials of both parties agree that the vice president also has to contend with weaknesses in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> that were exposed during the primary season. `` If the election were held today, I think <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would stand a good chance of winning <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>,'' where a Democrat last won in 1964, said the state's <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahaffey </PERSON>. As is often the case, the large industrial states _ <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> among them _ are viewed as key battlegrounds, although <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seems to hold the early advantage in each of them. Most officials believe <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> holds an advantage in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the second-largest state with 36 electoral votes. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is `` the strongest <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate'' to run in the state. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s base also gives him a good shot at <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, and Democratic officials say the three <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> states shape up as closer than usual. `` No matter what the polls look like this is going to be a close election because the vice president has an advantage in the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>,'' says <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager. He says in states in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and West there are `` 210 or 220 -LRB- electoral college votes -RRB- easily available for the vice president. ... The problem is the other 50 are going to be difficult.'' <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' communications director, says the Democrat intends to stage raids in normally secure Republican territory. `` We can win electoral votes in every region of the country,'' he says. It takes 270 <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> votes to win the presidency. The race could be heavily influenced by the vice presidential selections. The survey turned up little enthusiasm for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the Democratic ticket, in keeping with polls that indicate that such a pick would lose support. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been advised by some to look to a Southerner such as Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, a Westerner or perhaps <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> to fill out his ticket. `` If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does n't pick a Southerner, it just makes it that more difficult for us,'' said <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democratic Chairman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON>. On the Republican side, the name of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> came up frequently as talk turned to holding his state in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> column. Former <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> also was mentioned by several as a good Southern choice. Whatever the preferences, the polls indicate the importance of a vice presidential selection. A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> survey gives <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a margin of 48 percent to 41 percent over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But if <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> were to join the ticket, the survey shows the race would narrow to essentially even. Similarly, a recent poll in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gives <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a lead of 53 percent to 40 percent over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But the vice president would fare far better if <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> joins the ticket.

<TEXT>
 After graduating from college in three years, 11-year-old <PERSON> Adragon </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> faces a mind-boggling choice: Should he pursue the answer to cosmic riddles? Or should he go to junior high? Like most boys his age, the freckle-faced lad with a Prince Valiant haircut would rather not go back to junior high. `` I already know that stuff,'' he lamented Saturday as he received his bachelor's degree in mathematics from <ORGANIZATION> Cowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>. But, unless <PERSON> Adragon </PERSON> is admitted to a graduate program, he will be required by state law to go to junior high this fall. His father, <PERSON> Augustin </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, is prepared to send his son abroad to escape that fate. `` Our system is not equipped to deal with children like him,'' said the proud father, a single parent who started Adragon on a special learning program at an early age by hanging space mobiles over his crib. On CBS' `` This Morning'' program today, <PERSON> Adragon </PERSON> said, `` I'm not sure what graduate school I'll go to.'' However, he said, going back to junior high school `` wo n't do me any good.'' The father said he introduced <PERSON> Adragon </PERSON> to sophisticated books before he was a year old and that <PERSON> Adragon </PERSON> uttered his first `` Hello'' at 6 -LCB- weeks. `` When he was a little older than 1, he strapped on a guitar and started singing,'' the father said. <PERSON> Adragon </PERSON> knew the alphabet at age 2, could read and write by 3, and received an associate degree with highest honors from a two-year junior college by 10, the father said. <PERSON> Adragon </PERSON> spent just one year at the university. <PERSON> Adragon </PERSON> would like to continue his studies at the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> campus, but has not yet heard whether he's been accepted in the graduate division for the fall. `` I want to start learning scientific programming next year,'' he said. `` I want to go into astrophysics or particle physics, which hopefully will lead to the discovery of the creation of the universe, which is what I'm interested in.'' He says he would n't mind picking up a Nobel Prize along the way. <ORGANIZATION> Cowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> Provost <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said he had mixed feelings about <PERSON> Adragon </PERSON>'s rapid progress. `` It's quite an achievement, and he earned his degree. But I hope he will go on and be educated in life as broadly as he was in math,'' said <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Adragon </PERSON>'s father is concerned his son made no friends at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>. `` I kept questioning myself: Was this the right way to go? It gets harder and harder for him,'' said <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>. `` He isolated himself. ... His computers were his friends. It was very lonely for him.'' Although he's confident about his abilities to grow intellectually, <PERSON> Adragon </PERSON> himself worries about his social life. `` It is strange having everyone so much higher than you,'' he says. `` And in elementary school they have a recess. I once asked a student at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> where the playground was and he laughed. `` I finally found the playground in my computer.''

<TEXT>
 Scientists plan to turn a green cornfield into a laboratory this month to test a genetically altered microorganism in hopes of killing a caterpillar that costs American farmers about $ 400 million a year. Proponents call testing of the microorganism Cxc-Bt a step toward a new era of chemical-free pest control. Critics worry that genetically engineered materials will spread uncontrollably once released into the environment. The microorganism will be injected into corn stalks to combat the European corn borer, one of agriculture's most destructive pests. Although researchers have conducted other experiments of genetically altered materials in the environment, the tests will be the first approved for a genetically altered `` plant vaccine,'' said the microbe's creator, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, chief scientist of <ORGANIZATION> Crop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` If Crop Genetics is successful, this time or in future tests _ and there are similiar developments going on all over the place _ this will be a significant step forward in the production of food,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Godown </PERSON>, a Washington-based lobbyist for the industry. Biotechnology industry officials say Cxc-Bt is just the edge of a `` gene revolution'' that could dramatically boost crop production and help feed a world population expected to double in the next 40 years, while cleaning up the environment. But the industry's main critic says the field tests, which will begin June 20, are part of a dangerous trend to unleash hundreds of similiar products without evolutionary defenses against them. And, said <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, president of the Washington-based Foundation on Economic Trends, the pesticide does n't work. `` If they develop a niche, you're stuck with them,'' <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said. `` They mutate, they migrate, they have mobility _ you ca n't recall them. Environmental groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and the Environmental Defense Fund, did not oppose the limited field tests approved in May, and officials say if their questions about spread are answered with more tests, they may support the final product. The crucial question for environmental groups is whether there will be adequate testing and regulation because Cxc-Bt is just the beginning of a rush of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of similiar products, said <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinkle </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s director of agricultural policy. `` It's a wonderful idea,'' she said. `` If it works, it will be a tremendous boon.'' Whether Cxc-Bt will work is another question. <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said the microbe approved for limited field tests by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> does n't kill corn borers outside the petri dish and is being used by the biotechnical industry to set precedent. Field tests of Cxc without Bt produced yields that were 17 percent below normal, <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said. The Environmental Defense Fund also said Cxc can lower corn yields. But <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said the average corn yield at 33 test sites was on par with farmers', and only seven showed reduced yield, including one patch with a 17 percent drop. The organism being tested did not kill the corn borer outright but sickened it, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said. `` It's easier to get approval for testing a recombinant microbe if it's not a sledgehammer,'' he said. He hopes his product will weaken the caterpillars and then natural forces, such as disease, that were not present in greenhouse tests, will kill the moth larvae. Crop Genetics also is working on an improved form of Cxc-Bt that could kill the corn borer outright, as well as products to combat cotton, rice and soybean pests, he said. Concerned about insect transmission, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is requiring the test patches in <LOCATION> Queen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anne </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION> be sprayed against insects. <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldburg </PERSON>, an Environmental Defense Fund biologist, said the New York-based environmental group is not convinced <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s bug will work or is safe enough, but the possibility of an alternative to chemical pesticides is heartening and worth pursuing `` I believe there is a potential for some genetically engineered organisms to cause some ecological problems,'' Ms. <PERSON> Goldburg </PERSON> said. `` Lots of genetically engineered organisms wo n't cause any problems. What we have to believe is that we have the ability to say yes to some and no to others.'' Only one other genetic crop-protector, a microbe altered to fight frost, has been approved for field testing by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heier </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researcher injected a genetically altered bacteria into 14 elm trees in an effort to block Dutch elm disease, but he cut them down in 1987 after officials learned he conducted the experiment without federal or university approval.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> today deported Arab-American activist <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, an expulsion Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said was necessary to deter violence. Awad, wearing a white shirt and carrying a jacket, was accompanied up the stairway to the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> aircraft by two police officers before other passengers boarded. He waved briefly and appeared to make a V-for-victory sign before entering the jetliner. Police barred reporters from the tarmac at <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and took identification documents from several journalists who ventured near the plane. Armed border patrol guards forced news photographers off the roof of the terminal building. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight 885, carrying <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, took off at 4:15 p.m. Also today, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers fatally shot a 43-year-old Palestinian man in the head while searching a village near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, a hospital official said. The army said it was checking the report. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> last month ordered <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, a 44-year-old advocate of non-violent resistance to the Israeli occupation, deported despite <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> objections. The prime minister told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> today that <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s expulsion `` will have a deterrent influence'' on other Arabs. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> maintained <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> played a leading role in the six-month-old Arab uprising in the occupied lands. The rebellion has adopted some of the methods advocated by <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, including use of commercial strikes and boycotts of Israeli products. Awad was brought to the airport near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> more than an hour before his flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The convoy that accompanied the van included dozens of policemen. The van carrying <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> sped behind a hangar and was parked. Awad could not be seen by reporters. About a dozen Israeli supporters held placards at an airport entrance. One, written in Hebrew and English, read: `` Mubarak: Next Year in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> issued a written statement today in which he urged Israelis and Arabs to `` learn to take a risk for peace.'' `` It would be unfair and cowardly on our part to postpone our conflict for the next generation,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, who has a home in <LOCATION> Wapakoneta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, also vowed to return to his native <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Early today, in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Abwein </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops shot and killed <PERSON> Dib </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> after he failed to obey an order to halt, according to Dr. <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s family said he did not stop because he was deaf and could not hear the order. The death brought to 207 the number of Palestinians killed in the uprising that began Dec. 8 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Two Israelis have also died. On Sunday, Israeli officials discussed punishment for Palestinian arsonists blamed for fires that have destroyed at least 35,000 acres of woodland and farm pastures in the past week, officials said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> as he toured a factory near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would respond to an upsurge in <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> attacks `` swiftly and aggressively.'' Referring to an unprecedented firebomb attack Sunday at <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s main shopping mall, he said: `` This is more proof that they -LRB- the Arabs -RRB- are not just talking about the -LRB- occupied -RRB- territories but that the conflict is one for our survival. These are blows against our existence.'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and Industry Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> spoke out about a need to use guns to punish firebomb-throwers and arsonists who have destroyed <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> forests in recent weeks. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> session Sunday that he had authorized Israeli civilians in the occupied territories to shoot at Arabs holding firebombs, the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> daily reported. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, a former defense minister, said on <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> firebombers should be shot dead `` not only after they -LRB- the firebombs -RRB- are thrown. They must be shot with the intention to kill to allow normal life for both Arabs and Jews.'' Israeli police, meanwhile, arrested three 20-year-old Palestinian men suspected of trying to set fire in a field in a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> suburb over the weekend, the radio said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has also said he would introduce legislation to jail arsonists for up to 15 years.

 The stock market and the franc dropped today after voters denied <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> a legislative majority and created the prospect of an unstable governing coalition. The Socialists emerged from Sunday's second round of voting with the biggest bloc of votes, but must now look to the Communists or the centrists for a coalition partner to form a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> majority. Just a few weeks ago, the Socialists were widely expected to gain an absolute majority. Also, the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> all but vanished from the legislature, winning just one seat against 35 two years ago. Among the casualties was party leader <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>. Some commentators said the political landscape could remain unsettled for weeks or even months. Such uncertainty would be unusual in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which has known only stable government majorities since <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON> founded the Fifth Republic in 1958. Share prices declined on the <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> today in reaction to the prospect of instability, retreating an average of more than 2 percent. The franc fell to 3.38 against the Deutsche mark, compared to 3.39 at Friday's closing. `` The market hates a vaccum,'' said one trader at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> exchange. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s premier, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, tried to put the best face on the party's disappointment. `` You have chosen prudently,'' he told voters Sunday night in a television address. `` It will take several days to draw the appropriate conclusions of all these choices.'' However, others were more pessimistic. `` It will be the most subtle and complex situation you could imagine,'' said political commentator <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Duhamel </PERSON>. The Socialists could put together a majority in the 577-seat <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> either by joining with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> or by enticing some centrist members of the conservative coalition to change sides. Neither path looked easy. It also was possible that the Socialists would set up a minority government with <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> or someone new as premier. They would then try to win by seeking votes to the left or the right, depending on the issue. The Communists said they would not consider forming a coalition with the Socialists unless <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> reverses his movement toward the center and launches radical new economic policies to fight unemployment and poverty. Centrist leaders said they would not abandon their conservative allies. But they also indicated the time has come for right and left to find a way to work together. Sunday's election filled 575 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>; the final two seats will be determined in <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polynesia </LOCATION> on June 26. It takes 289 votes to form an absolute majority in the assembly. The Socialists had 276 seats. Just barely behind, the conservative alliance had 271. The conservative Rally for the Republic won 126, the center-right <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> took 129, and smaller rightist parties collected a total of 16. The Communists had 27. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> salvaged one seat. Its leaders said it fell victim to the replacement of a proportional electoral system by a system of majority vote in two rounds, which favors larger parties. The first round was June 5. Sunday's runoffs were in the 453 districts where no candidate won a majority the first time, and voter turnout was estimated at 71 percent. In 1986, the conservatives won control of the legislature and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was forced into an uncomfortable `` cohabitation'' with the right. But following <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s solid re-election victory May 8 with 54 percent of the vote over then-Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, it was widely expected that the Socialists would win a handy absolute majority in the assembly. But the pre-election polls proved wrong. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> met late Sunday night with <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> but made no immediate public statement. The new <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> is to meet for the first time June 23. After <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was first elected in May 1981, he called legislative elections and won a clear majority for his Socialists. He named four Communists Cabinet ministers, but they later quit when the government switched to an economic policy of austerity. Recently, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said the Socialists should pursue an `` opening'' toward the center, although exactly what he means has been the most-debated question in recent French politics. <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchais </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said his forces would vote for any Socialist proposals `` favorable to popular and national interests,'' but not commit them in advance to backing the government unless <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> changes course. <PERSON> Marchais </PERSON> called for `` a policy of effective struggle against unemployment, poverty and social inequality, an increase in purchasing power, salaries, pensions and welfare payments, a policy of new growth in the economy, a policy of freedom preserving the rights of wage-earners and the independence of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, a policy of peace and disarmament.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s policies by now may be closer to those of the centrists. However, the centrists have longstanding ties to their conservative partners that will not be broken easily.

 Guardian Angels founder <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> says the group will not stop its effort to rid a section near Times Square of drug dealers, even though one anti-crime patroller was critically injured in a confrontation. `` We will continue to bang away, inch by inch, apartment building by apartment building,'' <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> said Sunday. `` We will take back the neighborhood.'' Six Guardian Angels were injured and four people were arrested in connection with the incident Saturday night. The Guardian Angels, a volunteer group, have been patrolling the section at the request of restaurant owners in the theater district who have complained that crack dealers are driving away their customers. `` They're everywhere, like cockroaches,'' <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> said of the dealers. <PERSON> Illya </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtenberg </PERSON>, 16, of <LOCATION> Verona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was in critical condition today after he was hit in the head with a bottle and stabbed in the chest during the confrontation between about 15 Guardian Angels and 15 other people on the street, according to police and hospital spokesmen.

 Authorities using death certificates and toe tags have identified dozens of decaying bodies found stacked in a funeral home, some for years, but a coroner said some of the identities may never be known. `` There will be about 10 that no matter what we do we will not be able to identify them,'' Chief Medical Examiner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipkovic </PERSON> said Sunday. `` One does n't have a head or legs, so even if we had a dental chart, what could we do?'' Officials on a routine inspection discovered eight of the bodies early last week and another 36 were found Friday at <ORGANIZATION> Howell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chapel </ORGANIZATION>, which had the city contract for handling the bodies of indigents. Twenty-six boxes containing cremated ashes also were found at the funeral home. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulation </ORGANIZATION> suspended owner <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>'s license after the initial finds. Meantime, the painstaking process of identifying the remains continues. A clerk from the Vital Statistics office at the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> put in overtime this weekend pulling death certificates for investigators. `` We entered names into the computer, playing a matching game,'' <PERSON> Lipkovic </PERSON> said. Means of identification also have included hospital bracelets, <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>'s toe tags and medical appliances such as hip pins. Labels on cremation boxes were used to identify 26 sets of remains. By Sunday, officials had identified 49 of the 70 remains at the home. There were leads on identifying many of the remaining bodies, <PERSON> Lipkovic </PERSON> said. The oldest body was identified through a 1978 death certificate, <PERSON> Lipkovic </PERSON> said. Officials have not released the names of those identified and have not contacted family members. <PERSON> Lipkovic </PERSON> said he believes no more bodies will be found, but officials plan to bring in heavy equipment to dig up the yard behind the funeral home. Three crime scene experts from the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> and two homicide detectives from the Sheriff's Office are working on the investigation.

 Polish leader <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> today opened a two-day meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> with a plea for national reconciliation and a promise that more independent groups will be legalized. But he appeared to rule out talking to the outlawed Solidarity trade union, which Polish authorities have maintained accepts money from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. `` We can talk to anyone, as long as he is not a client, especially a paid one, of a foreign court,'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said. The plenum was the first meeting of the 230-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> since <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was shaken by strikes in April and May, and it was expected to give important signals of the authorities' future moves to prevent more unrest <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, first secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said upcoming nationwide elections for municipal and provincial councils offer Poles an opportunity to chose active candidates who could represent their needs. The elections Sunday are structured in a way that assures in advance that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its allies will dominate the councils. But <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said more seats have been set aside for non-party members. He said those independent people who refused to join the councils were `` another case of missing the train of history.'' The party leader, who also is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, said a government-social commission should be established to monitor price increases in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and said across-the-board price increases such as were introduced earlier this year should be avoided in the future. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> confirmed that Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> next month and said the trip will be important for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future. And the Polish leader spoke at length about the disenchantment of youth with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and called for redoubled efforts to win the allegiance of the younger generation. Referring to the strikes between April 25 and May 10, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said they increased the chance for national understanding because they showed the majority of Poles displayed `` a front of realism.'' Strikes took place in five factories, with brief stoppages or strike threats in 25 others. But the labor unrest did not spread out of control to factories around <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as it did in 1980, when Solidarity was born. A new law on associations is awaiting enactment, said <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, but that should not stop new groups from being legalized in the meantime. He mentioned no specifics, but there have been official hints that at least three independent groups _ a Warsaw-based pro-private enterprise <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, the dormant Polish chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> writers' club and the <LOCATION> Dziekania </LOCATION> political discussion club in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> _ may soon be legally registered. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> also suggested a `` round table'' meeting of representatives of existing and proposed associations to discuss solutions to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s problems. He gave no details on who would convene the meeting, who could be invited or when it might take place. `` National reconciliation and one of the goals of the socialist renewal,'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said. `` It is broader today than in past years.''

<HEAD>Court Will Rule in New York Medicare Fraud Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether the government may use a 19th Century anti-fraud law to impose stiff civil fines on top of criminal penalties assessed for the same offense. The court said it will hear an appeal by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials seeking to fine the manager of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> medical laboratory $ 131,170 for defrauding the government of $ 585 on Medicare bills. The government imposed the penalty against <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Halper </PERSON>, who runs <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Halper </PERSON> was convicted criminally of submitting inflated claims for Medicare reimbursement. He was sentenced to two years in prison and fined $ 5,000. Government officials then also fined him $ 131,170 under the False Claims Act, a civil statute enacted in 1863 to combat fraud against the Union army by Civil War defense contractors. The civil fine was based on $ 2,000 for each of 65 separate charges of overbilling plus $ 1,170 for double the actual loss suffered by the government. The government said <PERSON> Halper </PERSON> billed <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at $ 12 per patient for a service that <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> reimburses at $ 3. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweet </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> originally reduced the civil fine to $ 17,170 and subsequently cut it to $ 1,170 when the government protested the first reduction. Sweet said the stiff fine the government wants `` amounts to a criminal penalty for violations for which <PERSON> Halper </PERSON> has already been punished.'' He said the original fine `` bears no rational relation to the government's loss.'' The judge said the civil fine violated <PERSON> Halper </PERSON>'s double jeopardy protection against being punished twice for the same offense. In the appeal filed today, government lawyers pointed out that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 increased the fines so that offenders now may be penalized from $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 per offense, plus triple the actual government loss. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> strengthened the government's civil remedies because it determined that more severe sanctions were needed in order to stem the tide of rampant fraud inflicted on the government,'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said. Such a stiff penalty `` is reasonable and well within <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'s legislative power,'' they said The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Halper </PERSON>, 87-1383.

<HEAD>No. 2 Leader Of Shining Path Guerrillas Captured In Peru</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Police have captured the No. 2 leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION>, a fanatical Maoist group that has waged a guerrilla war against the government for eight years, a government minister said today. <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Morote </PERSON>, 42, was arrested by counterinsurgency police Sunday at a house in downtown <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> along with two women, Deputy Interior Minister <PERSON> Agustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantilla </PERSON> said. He declined to name the women. Morote had fake identification papers but was identified by his fingerprints, <PERSON> Mantilla </PERSON> said. The capture is considered the most important since the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> launched its guerrilla war in May 1980. Since then the violence has claimed more than 10,000 lives and cost this impoverished nation $ 5 billion in damage to its economy, according to government figures. Morote, known within the rebel band as `` Comrade <PERSON> Remigio </PERSON>,'' is second in importance only to <PERSON> Abimael </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, a former professor of philosophy who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> in 1970 as a splinter group of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Shining Path is seeking to overthrow <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s elected government and install a peasant and worker state patterned after the ideas of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>. <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON> is the ideologist of the organization, but <PERSON> Morote </PERSON> is considered the military strategist of the guerrillas and the advocate of attacks against peasant communities in the highlands that have formed civil defense units on the orders of the military. Intelligence sources said the capture is the most important achievement so far in the government's efforts to halt the advance of the rebel movement, which has spread from its base in the highland state of <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> through much of the country. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Morote </PERSON>'s capture will create a power vacuum within the central committee of the Shining Path and cause tension until a replacement is decided upon There have been reports in recent months of a growing rivalry between <LOCATION> Morote </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, 53, and <PERSON> Mantilla </PERSON> said he did not discount the possibility that <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON> had betrayed <PERSON> Morote </PERSON> to get him out of the way.

<HEAD>Court Declines to Study Racial-Desegregation Case from New York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, declining to study an unprecedented racial-desegregation case, today refused to free <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, officials from having to integrate city schools and build subsidized housing to overcome decades of discrimination. The court, without comment, left intact rulings that <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> must build subsidized housing in predomimantly white sections of the city and create `` magnet'' schools to reduce segregation. The case, stemming from a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit begun by the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration eight years ago, marked the first time the government linked discrimination in education and housing. <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, with some 200,000 residents, is located just north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. Sand, in a 600-page decision in 1985, ruled that <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> officials intentionally and unlawfully promoted racial segregation through their housing and school policies. He said the city had confined subsidized housing to predominantly black and Hispanic southwest <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, and that officials had bowed to the racial bias of some whites in resisting school integration. The judge then ordered the city to pay the multi-million-dollar bill for desegregating the school system and building 200 units of subsidized housing in predominantly white sections of the city. City officials agreed last January to build the 200 units but then sought to cancel the court-approved agreement. Sand refused on June 8 to cancel the agreement. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld Sand's 1985 ruling in a 163-page decision last December. The appeals court rejected arguments by school board and city officials that discrimination in schools and housing should not be linked. `` When two actors have cooperated in a given venture, each contributing to the outcome that each desires, it requires no stretch of legal doctrine to conclude that each actor is liable if the result deliberately attained is unlawful,'' the appeals court said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration supported the appeals court ruling, urging the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to reject the appeals acted on today. `` As they have throughout this litigation, the -LRB- school -RRB- board and the city blame each other for the segregated <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> public school system,'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said. `` This fingerpointing, however, should not divert this court's attention from the ... substantial evidence of cooperative, intentionally segregative actions by both the board and the city.'' The cases are <ORGANIZATION> Yonkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-1632, and <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-1686.

<TEXT>
 Israeli and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> intellectuals did today what their political leaders have been unable to do for 40 years _ they signed a peace accord. The `` treaty,'' written in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION>, Arabic and English on parchment-like paper, was signed by about 25 Israeli and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> writers and painters during a news conference at which foreign reporters far outnumbered local journalists. The document calls for the establishment of an independent <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state _ called `` Falastin'' _ in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured during the 1967 <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> war. The treaty recognizes the right of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Falastin </PERSON> to live in peace and security within their own borders. It designates <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> a demilitarized city with open borders, which would serve as the capital of both states. Israeli author <PERSON> Yoram </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaniuk </PERSON> described the signing as an `` historic moment.'' `` We hope this will have some kind of influence -LRB- on politicians -RRB- who say there is no one to talk to and nothing to talk about,'' he said, claiming the document represented the first treaty ever successfully negotiated by Israelis and Palestinians. <PERSON> Kaniuk </PERSON> is one of the leaders of the Israeli and <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupation </ORGANIZATION>, the only professional group that represents both Israelis and Palestinians from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The group includes left-wing Israeli artists, among them poet <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zach </PERSON>. He recently canceled an international poetry festival to protest allegedly harsh measures by the army to quell the 6-month-old Palestinian uprising in which 207 Palestinians have been killed and about 5,000 injured. Two Israelis also have been killed. <PERSON> Asad </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Asad </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in the occupied territories, said the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> favors the terms of the artists' treaty. `` We feel we are transmitting clearly and honestly the message of our represenatives, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Asad </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary, refuses to recognize the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, saying it is a terrorist organization. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which has called for the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, has also refused to accept <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to secure its borders. <PERSON> Kaniuk </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> `` negotiators'' often disagreed about the terms of the treaty and each side eventually had to `` give up dreams and accept reality.'' <PERSON> Zach </PERSON> said he would now extend his appeal beyond the circle of the committee and ask all like-minded artists, writers and academics in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the occupied territories to sign the treaty. `` If clods like us, who are not always very good at taking action, can do it, so can politicians,'' said <PERSON> Zach </PERSON>. `` If they do n't, it's because they do n't want to or are afraid to.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected the appeal of a <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> family fortune heir declared mentally incompetent after he lent $ 212,000 to a group linked to political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>. The court, without comment, let stand rulings that control of <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> duPont <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s $ 8 million estate properly was taken from him in 1985 under <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s guardianship law. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s appeal contended that his freedom of political expression and association had been violated. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 31, lives in <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. He is the son of <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newbold </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> duPont </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, and is heir to a significant portion of the family fortune. In 1985, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> had access to about $ 1.5 million in assets and marketable securities.

Learning of his intention to lend an additional $ 75,000 to Caucus Distributions, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s family on April 11, 1985, asked a judge to appoint a financial guardian for him.

His ruling was upheld by a state appeals court. `` We agree ... that -LRB- <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s -RRB- mental illness has resulted in producing a condition that has made him a victim of the LaRouche organization,'' the appeals court said.

 The Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said today a policeman in the Azerbaijani capital of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> was killed by a shotgun blast fired by an Armenian during an ethnic protest. <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, also told a news briefing that rumors saying two Armenians had been killed in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> led to a protest march in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday. He said a general strike had been called in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital, to demand the disputed <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region be turned over to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. `` We have received the information from <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> that the information about the murder of two Armenians is false,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. `` In fact, there was a shooting in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> from a shotgun ... and the bullet killed a militia sergeant.'' The policeman, identified as a Sgt. <PERSON> Izmailov </PERSON>, was killed by a shot fired by an Armenian with the last name of <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Izmailov </PERSON> was born in 1951 and <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON> in 1932, the spokesman said. He provided no other information about the men. `` The bullet was deflected from some kind of surface,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. Police had not yet determined whether the killing was premediated, he said. The shooting occurred `` during a demonstration for retaining the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>,'' he said. He did not say when the policeman was killed. Armenians gathered in a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> cemetery on Sunday and marched to the offices of the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency because of rumors that two Armenians had been killed in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. He said the rumor was false. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> also said that Armenians gathered in the central square of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> on Sunday and called a general strike until Wednesday, when the Presidium of the Armenian Supreme Soviet is to meet. Armenians are demanding that the republic's nominal legislature go on record in support of annexing the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region. He said a sit-in, meetings and demonstrations were continuing in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> is part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> republic located south of the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> and next to the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, that is dominated by ethnic Armenians. They began demonstrating in mid-February to press their demand to be annexed to neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. In February, violence erupted in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, a city in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The government says 32 people, 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis, were killed. The government several weeks later turned down the demand to allow <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> to annex <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and ethnic unrest has continued since then. In May the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders of both <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> were replaced on the same day, an indication of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s displeasure with their inability to cope with the unrest

 A federal antitrust lawsuit by actor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and director <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> over profits from video cassette sales and rentals was killed by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today. The court, without comment, let stand rulings that threw out the 1985 suit against <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> and its parent <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> contended that Universal and other major movie studios illegally conspired in the early 1980s to hold down artificially the profits paid to actors and directors from video sales and rentals The lawsuit said that as a result <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> did not receive their fair share of the profits from two movies made years earlier, `` The Sting'' and `` Slapshot.'' Both men had signed `` profit participation agreements'' giving them a percentage of all income received for showing the movies. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ideman </PERSON> dismissed the suit, ruling that <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> had suffered no antitrust injury. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the dismissal last year. `` The fundamental problem is that <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> entered into contracts ... between 1972 and 1976, before the alleged conspiracy arose,'' the appeals court said. `` The subsequent conspiracy could not have affected the competition for <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s services at the time the contracts were made.'' In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> called the appeals court ruling `` bizarre.'' `` How is it possible that a direct victim of a horizontal price-fixing conspiracy does not suffer antitrust injury?'' the appeal asked. The case is <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1617.

<TEXT>
 A newspaper's thwarted attempt to obtain the names and addresses of jurors who served in a much-publicized <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> murder trial failed to win <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review today. The justices, without comment, turned away arguments by <PERSON> Newsday </PERSON> that the public has a constitutional right of access to such information unless there exist specific reasons justifying secrecy. The controversy stems from the 1984 trial in <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> on charges of murdering his estranged wife, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> was shot through a window of her home while watching television with her two children on June 29, 1982. During jury deliberations in <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>'s trial, a reporter for the Long Island-based newspaper asked court officials for the jurors' names and addresses. The request was denied. After <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>'s trial ended in a mistrial due to a deadlocked jury, <PERSON> Newsday </PERSON> continued to seek the juror information. The <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner of Jurors refused to give the newspaper the information it sought. He said the jurors' names and addresses fell within the confidentiality exemptions of a state law aimed at curtailing secrecy within the state court system. <PERSON> Newsday </PERSON> sued over the blocked access, claiming a constitutional right to criminal trial records. Three state courts rejected Newsday's appeal. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, the state's highest court, ruled last Dec. 23 that the names and addresses of jurors who serve in criminal trials may be kept confidential. `` Inasmuch as -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has not contended that it has been denied access to any judicial proceedings, or to any transcripts of any proceedings, -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- constitutional right of access has not been violated,'' the state court ruled. In the appeal acted on today, <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> relied on past <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions upholding the public's right to attend criminal trials, including jury selection and pretrial hearings. The appeal said `` the interest which led this court to recognize'' such rights `` are also promoted by access to the names and addresses of jurors.'' The newspaper urged the court to recognize `` a First Amendment right of access to jurors' names and addresses which must be properly considered before such access may be denied.'' The case is Newsday vs. Sise, 87-1748.

The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police unlawfully searched <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>'s nightclub dressing room. A state appeals court ruled that evidence gathered by police in the unlawful 1982 search _ including cocaine and a pistol confiscated from <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION> _ should not have been used as evidence at <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION>'s trial. <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION>, who gained fame as part of the group called <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Stills </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>, was convicted of unlawfully possessing cocaine and carrying a handgun in a tavern. A state appeals court overturned the conviction and prison sentence last Nov. 12. <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> was freed after having served five months of the sentence. In the appeal acted on today, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutors argued that the state court wrongly found that <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> enjoyed a `` reasonable expectation of privacy'' in the dressing room of a `` closely regulated, state-licensed, liquor-selling establishment.''

<TEXT>
 The world's most powerful atom smasher is set to start exploring some of nature's deepest mysteries this week and physicists are thrilled at the prospects for scientific breakthroughs. After nearly 10 years of construction and fine-tuning, the giant collider at the <ORGANIZATION> Fermi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accelerator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, is ready to come on line to smash protons and antiprotons together. `` We have the potential for making more discoveries in high-energy physics than at any other time in history,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Fermi </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lederman </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Fermilab </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dease </PERSON> said today that the start-up date is not certain but it is expected to be this week. More than 200 physicists from around the world will be participating in the search for tiny subatomic particles that have so far eluded scientists trying to unravel the basic details of how the universe works. <ORGANIZATION> Fermilab </ORGANIZATION>'s collider has three times the power of its closest competitor, the <ORGANIZATION> CERN </ORGANIZATION> collider in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, and could open the door to new, unexpected scientific discoveries, officials say. `` Now we really get to go into the unknown,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> physicist <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwitters </PERSON>. `` That's why we're in the business.'' <PERSON> Schwitters </PERSON>, co-director of the $ 40 million Collider Detector Facility, compared the collider to using `` wrecking bars and sledgehammers to try to find the treasure.'' The Fermilab collider whirls protons and antiprotons around in opposite directions on a 4-mile circular track called the Tevatron. The protons and antiprotons travel at a speed close to that of light _ 186,000 miles a second. When they collide, they annihilate in a burst of energy reaching 2 trillion electron volts, equivalent to a temperature of 10,000 trillion degrees. The detector facility traps the traces of particles produced by the collisions.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today turned down the appeal of a philosophy professor denied an opportunity to address <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about secular humanism during the lawmakers' daily moments of opening prayer. The court, over one dissenting vote, refused to hear arguments that the professor's rights were violated. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> voted to review the case more fully. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>, who teaches philosophy at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, said he unlawfully was denied an invitation to make remarks to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about his humanist beliefs. He had asked the chaplains of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to let him speak during the time designated for opening prayers. <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> said he was barred from speaking because he told the chaplains he would not lead the lawmakers in prayer. `` The opening ceremonies of our nation's legislature, if they claim to represent anybody, must represent everybody, the religious and non-religious alike,'' <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>'s lawyer argued. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here threw out <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>'s suit last September. The chaplains of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> occasionally invite guests to deliver the opening prayers. <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> wrote to the chaplains in 1984, seeking to address either or both houses. He said, `` As a secular humanist, I would not, of course, invoke any deity during my remarks. I do believe that it is important, however, -LRB- for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- occasionally to have the opportunity to hear non-theists speak of moral responsibilities.'' Both chaplains declined to invite him. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chaplain said <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> must have a senator sponsor him to receive an invitation. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chaplain told him that each <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> session must begin with a prayer. <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> then sued the chaplains and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. His suit named <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> on grounds that the treasury provided taxpayer money to fund the chaplain programs in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The appeals court threw out his suit on grounds that the chaplains lacked the authority to permit <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> to speak. That deprives <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> of legal standing to sue, the appeals court said. The rare privilege for outsiders of addressing either house requires approvals of the members of each house, the appeals court said. `` Even if the chaplains had agreed to invite <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>, it would be unreasonable to imagine that they could have provided him with the actual opportunity to deliver non-religious remarks to either house of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> during the time expressly set aside for prayer,'' the appeals court said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration urged the justices to reject <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>'s appeal, but on different grounds <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> must lose his case because a 1983 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the constitutionality of prayers that open each day of the <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. The court said such prayers do not violate Constitution's establishment clause requiring separation of church and state. `` So too is it untenable to contend, as -LRB- <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> -RRB- does, that the framers -LRB- of the Constitution -RRB- intended the establishment or free-speech component of the First Amendment as equal-time provisions, mandating non-theistic speech-making whenever <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> permits religious invocations,'' the government lawyers said. The case is <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 87-1581.

<HEAD>Court Rules in Michigan Police-Rights Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today that police officers sometimes may chase a person who starts running at the sight of them even though they have no reason to suspect criminal conduct. The court unanimously ruled that <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> prosecutors may use as evidence the drugs dropped by a man who began running when he spotted a police cruiser on a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> street. Writing for the court, Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> officers' pursuit of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mose </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesternut </PERSON> did not amount to a `` seizure'' under the Constitution's Fourth Amendment. The amendment generally requires police to have a warrant or `` probable cause'' to suspect a crime before conducting any search or seizure. The court held in 1980 that a person is seized _ as opposed to arrested _ when, `` in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.'' Adhering to that principle, <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said <PERSON> Chesternut </PERSON> `` was not unlawfully seized during the initial police pursuit.'' <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> noted that the police did not sound their cruiser's siren or order Chesternut to halt They merely pursued him as he ran, <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said. `` While the very presence of a police car driving parallel to a running pedestrian could be somewhat intimidating, this kind of police presence does not, standing alone, constitute a seizure,'' he said. According to court records, <PERSON> Chesternut </PERSON> was standing on a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> street corner talking to another man a little after midnight on Dec. 19, 1984 when he saw a police cruiser. Police said <PERSON> Chesternut </PERSON> immediately started running away, and was followed by the officers. After turning a corner, and as the cruiser drew alongside of him, <PERSON> Chesternut </PERSON> threw a number of packets to the ground and then stopped. The officers said they picked up the packets, which appeared to contain narcotics, and then arrested <PERSON> Chesternut </PERSON>. He was charged with possessing heroin, codeine and diazapan. A state judge threw out the case, ruling that police lacked a reasonable suspicion to pursue Chesternut and therefore had seized the evidence unlawfully. A state appeals court upheld the dismissal. But today's ruling reinstated the charges against <PERSON> Chesternut </PERSON>. The case is <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> vs. Chesternut, 86-1824.

 Six detainees, including an ex-soldier facing a possible death sentence for killing two people while he dressed as a `` Ninja'' warrior, escaped from jail, and five remained at large today, authorities said. Two of the escapees faced first-degree murder charges, but one of the two was quickly recaptured, authorities said. The detainees used a hacksaw blade late Sunday to cut through cell bars, knocked out a fourth-floor window at the <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail and lowered themselves on a rope made of bedsheets, authorities said. The breakout occurred minutes before the 11 p.m. lockdown, when the inmates are returned to their cells and locked in for the night, officials said. The escape apparently was spotted by a <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION> police officer, who noticed someone drop from the center, Sheriff's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> said <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 20, who was being held on charges of killing a woman, injured himself while falling from the fourth floor and was recaptured and taken to <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, authorities said. The five others included <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, who confessed to the stabbing deaths of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, 68, and his wife, <PERSON> Janie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutz </PERSON>, 62. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, a 21-year-old former soldier at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty to the December 1986 murders, and was to appear in Superior Court today for a continuation of the sentencing phase of his trial. He faces the death penalty or life in prison. The slayings came to be known as the `` Ninja'' murders because <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> and accused accomplice <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, another former soldier at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, allegedly were dressed in black clothes resembling outfits worn by Japanese Ninja warriors. The other escapees were: <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Pond </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, held in the Jan. 21 slaying of a pawn shop employee; <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, held on a charge of first-degree burglary; <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnick </PERSON>, 22, of <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, held on charges of second-degree burglary, first-degree sex offense and common law robbery; and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 30, of <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, held on charges of felony breaking and entering. Little said he had no information on why <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was held, and did not have complete descriptions on the other escapees. Little said escape by sawing through the bars is supposed to be impossible because the cells are designed with a bar within a bar. When someone trying to saw through the outer bar reaches the inner bar, it just spins, said Little. He later said that type of construction was not used in the bar the inmates cut. He said the six were assigned to Cell Block F in the jail's top floor, where they are allowed into a common area during the day, but are locked in individual cells at night.

 A Harris poll released today indicated a closer presidential race than public opinion surveys last month, with Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> holding a slim five-point lead over Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lead was within the poll's margin of sampling error and was slightly down from his seven-point advantage in a <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> poll released last month. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had a double-digit lead in some other surveys in May. The new Harris poll, conducted by telephone June 1-6, found 49 percent support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has clinched the Democratic nomination, and 44 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican nomination campaign winner. Seven percent were unsure. <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> contacted 1,258 likely voters, and the margin of sampling error in its survey was plus or minus three percentage points.

<HEAD>Soviets Claim Property In Jerusalem, Expected To Demand Rent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> claims it owns a government building and a downtown parking lot in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and is expected to demand several million dollars in back rent, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials and media said today. The Soviets also are expected to claim other property in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, most of it believed acquired decades ago through the Russian Orthodox Church. Israeli government officials declined to comment on specific Soviet claims, but <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> city spokeswoman <PERSON> Sivana </PERSON> <PERSON> Meryn </PERSON> said the city acknowledged a paved parking lot on King George Street in downtown <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> was built on Soviet property. She said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would be willing to negotiate rental payments. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> says the building which currently houses the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> also belongs to the Soviets. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said they were ready to discuss the claims but hoped the talks would be friendly and would not disrupt a movement toward improved ties between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> severed ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to protest the Israeli capture of lands from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> in the 1967 war. Last July, for the first time since then, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> sent a consular delegation to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to examine property holdings and speak to the estimated 2,500 Soviet passport holders in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in return has asked that it be allowed to send a delegation to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said last week that Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told him the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> delegation would receive Soviet visas next month. On Sunday, the head of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation, <PERSON> Georgi </PERSON> <PERSON> Martirosow </PERSON>, informed the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> that the delegates had completed a survey of property owned by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and currently being used by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martirosow </PERSON> recently returned from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> where he spent several weeks combing Soviet archives for deeds and other documents showing Soviet property holdings in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said. The Soviet delegates are expected to present a detailed list of their holdings along with demands for rental payments in the next several weeks, the official said, requesting anonymity. A spokesman who answered the telephone at the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation's office declined comment. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said two weeks ago that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would be willing to renew ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> once all parties in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict agreed to participate in an international peace conference. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, however, has rejected <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> participation in such a conference.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today told <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s highest court to restudy the case of a teen-ager born out of wedlock who says she should be allowed to seek support payments from her father's estate The justices said the <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> should review its ruling that a $ 4,600 settlement between <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON>'s parents after she was born bars her from seeking any additional money Today's order sending the case back to <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> said the state court should consider it in light of the justices' decision last week striking down as unconstitutional a six-year deadline <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> imposed for filing paternity lawsuits. Miss <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Baraboo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, was born Sept. 7, 1969. Her mother, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON>, reached an agreement in 1970 with <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who admitted he was <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s father and agreed to pay $ 3,600 in child support over the next four years plus $ 1,000 in hospital costs. A lawsuit was filed in behalf of the child in 1984 seeking additional support payments from <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who died in 1986 when the private plane he was piloting crashed. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> owned his own biochemical research business. His widow, who lives in <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prairie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, is the heir to his estate. The suit in behalf of <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> sought 17 percent of <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s gross income since 1974, plus additional money for his daughter's medical bills and medical The suit also sought to have her named his primary beneficiary in a life insurance policy. The <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last June threw out the suit. The appeals court said the lump sum settlement between <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON>'s parents in 1970 bars any further lawsuit based on long-standing doctrine The state court said the doctrine is based on the principle that `` fairness to the defendant requires that at some point litigation over the particular controversy must come to an end.'' The state court said the interests of <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> were `` virtually represented by her mother'' when the agreement with <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was reached. `` Although the settlement agreement ... appears, in hindsight, to be low, we are satisfied that it is not unconscionable.'' The appeals court also rejected arguments that <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON>'s rights were violated because such lump-sum settlements were only permitted for illegitimate children <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> law was amended in 1981 to ban such settlements for children born out of wedlock and to require continuing support for them. Miss <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON> is attending college at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Baraboo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and is living with her mother, who does part-time work as a cleaning lady and clerk. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> state officials urged the high court to hear the case and rule in favor of Miss <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON>. Attorney General <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanaway </PERSON> said permitting the lump-sum payments for those born out of wedlock creates a class of children `` totally deprived of an ability to receive child support from fathers who have the ability to pay.'' The case is <PERSON> Gerhardt </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 87-1103.

<TEXT>
 Soviet forces reportedly have returned to some cities in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to fight Moslem guerrillas who have raided posts defended by Afghan troops, sources said today. Dr. <PERSON> Ijaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilani </PERSON>, an analyst at the Pakistani-based <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said he has received reports that the Soviet forces are back at the garrison of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, near the Pakistani border. There was no independent confirmation of <PERSON> Gilani </PERSON>'s report. <PERSON> Gilani </PERSON> said Afghan forces have remained on the defensive since the Soviets began withdrawing their troops on May 15. `` The low morale of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime soldiers touched a new low with the withdrawal of Russian troops from certain garrison towns and strong points,'' <PERSON> Gilani </PERSON> said. Soviet troops first entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to support its Marxist government. <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, on the main road from <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, to the capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, was the first Soviet garrison vacated. Although Soviet officials claimed the garrison was left completely to the Afghan troops, guerrillas say they have spotted Soviet soldiers there long after the reported pullout. <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, scene of a major battle early this year after it was seized by guerrillas, was recently reported again on the verge of collapse as rebels poured in from the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border, just 15 miles away. <PERSON> Gilani </PERSON> said he had no precise figures on the Soviet redeployment, but officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> have warned they might revise their nine-month withdrawal time frame if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continue to arm the Moslem guerrillas. `` The war is still continuing at a medium pace, with more initiative in the hands of the -LRB- guerrillas -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Gilani </PERSON> said. Statistics compiled by <PERSON> Gilani </PERSON> and his analysts indicated there were 266 battles in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in May, down from 431 in the corresponding month in 1987. He said 231 of the attacks last month were launched by guerrillas and 35 by Soviet-Kabul forces. According to estimates by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, some 2,450 Afghan troops defected to the guerrillas last month. However, <PERSON> Gilani </PERSON> said it was difficult to determine the difference between outright defections and cases in which Afghan troops have surrendered to the insurgents. The report also said 868 soldiers were killed in May, including 54 Soviets, 192 guerrillas, 542 Afghan troops and 80 unidentified people. In April, a total of 1,149 soldiers died, compared to a September 1987 high of 2,351, according to the report.

<HEAD>Court Turns Aside German Woman's Effort To Recover Stolen Painting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A West German woman's effort to recover the <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Monet </PERSON> painting stolen from her sister's home during World War II ended unsuccessfully in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that <PERSON> Gerda </PERSON> <PERSON> Deweerth </PERSON> waited too long before trying to recover the painting from <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldinger </PERSON>, who bought it in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1957. The painting, <PERSON> Monet </PERSON>'s `` Champs de Ble a <LOCATION> Vetheuil </LOCATION>,'' is one of a series of impressionist landscapes painted near the town of <LOCATION> Vetheuil </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The oil painting shows a wheat field, a village and trees. It is signed and dated `` <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Monet </PERSON>'79.'' <PERSON> Monet </PERSON> is one of the best known members of the school of impressionistic artists active in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was from his early work, `` Impression: Sunrise, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Havre </PERSON>,'' that the term impressionism was coined. The painting at issue is valued at more than $ 500,000, according to the appeals court that ruled against Ms. <PERSON> Deweerth </PERSON>. She inherited the painting in 1922, and kept it in her home at <LOCATION> Wuppertal-Elberfeld </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In 1943, Ms. <PERSON> DeWeerth </PERSON> sent the painting to her sister's home in southern <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for safekeeping during the war. When American troops quartered in the house departed in 1945, the painting disappeared. Lower courts assumed it was stolen. Ms. <PERSON> Baldinger </PERSON> was a good-faith purchaser of the <ORGANIZATION> Monet </ORGANIZATION> 12 years later. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ruled that the painting must be returned to Ms. <PERSON> DeWeerth </PERSON>, but the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reversed his ruling. The appeals court said Ms. <PERSON> DeWeerth </PERSON> `` failed to exercise reasonable diligence in locating the painting after its disappearance'' and therefore had waited too long, under <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law, before suing its current owner. The case is <PERSON> DeWeerth </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Baldinger </PERSON>, 87-1752.

<TEXT>
 A 16-year-old student who praised <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform movement won <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s first beauty pageant and walked away with a wealth of prizes that drew a gasp of amazement from the audience. `` I felt exactly like <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> in Wonderland,'' <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalinina </PERSON> said Sunday after her warm smile and svelte figure won over the 12 judges, who chose her from six finalists in a contest that emphasized bathing suit competition. Photographers were waiting for her as she arrived at school today and hurried to a second-floor classroom to take the equivalent of her high school final examinations. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, an afternoon paper, reported with almost unbelieveable speed for the normally slow Soviet press that Ms. <PERSON> Kalinina </PERSON> received the highest mark in her Spanish test and top grades in literature and math exams as well. Like the other finalists, Ms. <PERSON> Kalinina </PERSON> is very thin, in contrast to the common perception in the West that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> women are stout. The `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Beauty'88'' contest, made possible by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s more tolerant policies, was the first of its kind in the Soviet capital Millions of Soviets watched a live television broadcast of the pageant. Although similar pageants have been staged in several other Soviet cities, such contests are still a new phenomenon in a socialist society which long disdained them as bourgeois. It was not clear yet whether the new beauty queen would compete in nationwide or international pageants. Ms. <PERSON> Kalinina </PERSON> was the youngest contestant in a field of 36 that included an accountant, two librarians and two actresses. The oldest was <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Baranova </PERSON>, 26, a doctor who did not reach the final round Sunday night. During the question-and-answer competition, practically the only event in which the finalists wore more than a tiny scrap of clothing, Ms. <PERSON> Kalinina </PERSON> was asked what made the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> contest different from beauty pageants in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. `` Ours is different because we have ` perestroika,''' she replied, using the Russian word for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of economic and social reforms. The third and final night of what was gala event by normally austere Soviet went smoothly until the glittering crown was placed on Ms. <PERSON> Kalinina </PERSON>'s head. At that moment, long-stemmed red roses began to rain from the ceiling, knocking off the crown and causing the beauty queen to duck and dodge, although she never lost her smile. The next shower of roses was aimed a little in front of the beauty queen, and did not disrupt the ceremonies. As the master of ceremonies read out the list of prizes for Ms. <PERSON> Kalinina </PERSON>, the crowd of 11,000 in the Palace of Sport sighed in amazement. The prizes included: a cruise on the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, a trip to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, a television and mounds of cosmetics from the Western and Soviet sponsors of the event. The other finalists, and some of the other contestants, received cosmetics and trips inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for categories such as the `` most photogenic'' and `` most athletic.'' Trips abroad are rare for Soviet citizens, and Western cosmetics of the types distributed to the finalists are highly prized in this country. Some of the loudest applause of the evening went to writer <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Zadurnov </PERSON>, who performed comedy routines satirizing consumer shortages and the bureaucrats that are blocking Soviet reforms. At the end of an evening dominated by rock music by Soviet bands, <PERSON> Zadurnov </PERSON> said: `` And we Muscovites would like to thank <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' alluding to the facelift <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> received for the recent superpower summit. The parting line brought gasps of surprise from the crowd, then thunderous laughter and applause.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he has `` no long list, no short list'' for the vice presidential spot on the Republican ticket, adding that he has only now started to consider a process to choose a running mate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who clinched the presidential nomination two months ago, told reporters that he and his aides are `` getting a little procedure worked out'' for winnowing the field of prospects for the No. 2 spot on the ticket. `` I've enjoyed all the fabulous speculation,'' about whom he might select, the vice president told reporters called to his office in the Old Executive Office Building. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced the hiring of two new top-level campaign aides to deal with the press. <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, who was spokeswoman to first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> from 1981-85, was named press secretary, and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>, who held previous press roles in the 1980 and 1984 Reagan-Bush campaigns, was named as a senior communications adviser. Pressed to say how close he was to picking a vice presidential running mate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` No list. ... We're getting a little procedure worked out. So there literally is no long list, no short list.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated that he will not seriously consider the question until after the Democrats put together their ticket in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> next month. Meanwhile, he continues to get advice from party activists. `` I think we need an exciting vice presidential candidate,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Garrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` We need someone, certainly, who is a good communicator, like <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' `` I recommended to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that he choose <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON> said in an interview. He was n't alone in offering advice to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the vice president's aides. It's apparent the suggestion box at the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign is packed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his aides have been reluctant to talk about what selection process they'll use, how long a Bush short-list of candidates might be, or when the choice will be made known. But the jockeying to have an impact on this decision was evident at the `` Unity'88'' weekend conference put on by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Former Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who joined Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> in saluting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, joked about the speculation the also-rans in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> competition came to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to protect their prospects for the spot on the ticket. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said that since he had run for president, and been defeated by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he had no interest in seeking the second spot. `` I'm content,'' he said The list of names has lengthened in recent weeks, including speculation about potential women candidates such as Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, along with Senator <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, du Pont. Plus Govs. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. `` I would like to see somebody that would be just a little bit more conservative -LRB- than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB-, just to satisfy the right wing of the party,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman from <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. Joy Wood of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, who is trying to unseat Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., said `` I'm pushing for a very experienced I think the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has very qualified women at the top. But I, as a woman, want the strongest vice presidential candidate.'' `` I suspect it will be a man, but I just hope it will be a very qualified person,'' she said. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairwoman in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, said `` I think it's a possibility'' that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will select a woman. But she also said that `` I have stated that it's important to look to someone who understands the West.'' Punch Green, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign chairman in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, said, `` I want him to pick a guy or a gal who will be a vice president just like <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ a person who will disagree with him at times in the Oval Office, but then stand by the president when he makes the decision.'' <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON>, however, said he hoped <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would n't make the choice based mostly on the basis of perceived loyalty. `` Loyalty is one condition, but I would hope that it would not be the first-order condition,'' he said. `` What I would concern myself with most is the selection of a winner,'' <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> criticized <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> today as a `` racist state'' but said he would not support breaking off diplomatic relations. The apparent Republican presidential nominee commented as a new poll suggested he was gaining slightly on Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked at the White House whether he agreed with a move by the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> to have their party platform brand <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` a terrorist state.'' `` I think it's a racist state, regrettably,'' he said. That language was stronger than President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> uses, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s policy recommendation was the same as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has followed. He said the government must see whether `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can use its moral influence to change things'' in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The new <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> poll showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with a 5-point lead, just within the survey's margin of potential sampling error. That was down from a 7-point advantage in a similar poll last month. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was supported by 49 percent, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by 44 percent and 7 percent were unsure in the poll in which <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> contacted 1,258 likely voters the first week of June. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. One day earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, seeking black support, edged away from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on aid to minority businesses, while Democrat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> suggested he would use the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military to help fight the war on drugs. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, meanwhile, struck a conciliatory stance on the touchy issue of whether he wants to be the Democratic vice presidential candidate. After declaring last week that he was entitled to consideration and that `` consideration means an offer,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backed off a bit. `` I do not want to push <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to that point,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Sunday, interviewed from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press.'' Asked whether he should be offered the No. 2 spot, he said only that he deserved `` serious consideration.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spent the weekend in his hometown of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, mulling his next move. He has said he will campaign all the way up to the Democratic convention. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wrapped up the Democratic nomination in the final four primaries last week. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was meeting today with congressional leaders and law enforcement officials from several states to discuss drug issues. He also sounded an anti-drug theme on Sunday, when he told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> the administration's anti-drug effort is in a state of `` chaos. That was an apparent dig at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who headed an administration task force on anti-drug efforts. Without providing specifics, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the mayors, meeting in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, that the military should be prepared to assist in drug-interdiction efforts. `` It will take tough, sustained and unrelenting enforcement ... at home and abroad, enforcement which uses the military where appropriate and necessary,'' he said. As <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke, Democratic party platform drafters were calling for the appointment of a federal drug czar. A platform-drafting panel wrapped up a long weekend of work Sunday at the resort of <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. In addition to backing a drug czar, the Democrats released working papers that urged expanded AIDS research, adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment, greater efforts to end homelessness, and a law requiring employers to give workers advance notice of plant closings. The Jackson forces had mixed success at the platform-drafting sessions. The committee agreed the Democratic platform will label <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state, as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has demanded. But the panel was split on whether to call for a Jackson-backed freeze in Pentagon spending, and expressed reluctance to call for the tax hikes <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wants. Despite some bickering, the Democrats put up a united front. `` I found more areas of agreement than disagreement,'' said Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, the chairman of the drafting panel and a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter. The Republicans, too, were making like a happy family. Over the weekend in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, at the first of three `` unity conferences'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> activists from 16 states _ and three former rivals for the nomination _ rallied around <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The vice president, who pleased many Republican observers when he went on the offensive last week against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, promised the party faithful on Saturday they'd be seeing more of the same. `` We're just beginning,'' he said. Another <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tactic has been distancing himself from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on selected issues. One of them is likely to be civil rights, and the vice president stepped slightly away from the administration on the use of federal aid to assist minority businesses. `` I support strongly increased minority development efforts by the federal government,'' he said in a commencement speech Sunday at predominantly black <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wilberforce </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` We must bring black Americans and other minorities into the free enterprise system.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has opposed government programs that set aside a portion of contracts for minority-run businesses. Such set-asides have been used by federal, state and local governments as a way to remedy past discrimination. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who celebrated his 64th birthday Sunday, was awarded an honorary degree by the university. Later Sunday, the vice president flew to <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where he campaigned for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congressional candidate <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Arey </PERSON> and repeated his call for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to join him in requesting an independent counsel's investigation of alleged ethics breaches by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who is under preliminary investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has denied the allegations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today, where he planned to spend the first part of the week. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> scheduled a three-day Southern campaign swing later in the week.

 Companies may violate antitrust law when they lobby private organizations that play a prominent role in influencing business legislation, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. The 7-2 decision upheld a $ 11.4 million jury award against a company accused of `` packing'' a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> when the organization adopted a safety code for electrical wiring. Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, in his opinion for the court, said such activity to influence a private organization does not warrant the same antitrust immunity granted to businesses and trade groups that lobby governmental bodies. `` The activity at issue here did not take place in the open political arena, where partisanship is the hallmark of decision-making, but within the confines of a private standard-setting process,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. Also, he said, the activity involved more than `` an exercise of the power of persuasion.'' The adoption of an industry code `` in part involves the exercise of market power'' because members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, including consumers, distributors and manufacturers, implicitly agreed to abide by the association's rules, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. `` Given the context and nature of the conduct, it can more aptly be characterized as commercial activity with a political impact,'' he said. The case stemmed from a May 1980 meeting of the association that adopted a model legislative code for electrical conduit, a hollow tubing used in building construction to carry insulated electrical wires. Allied Tube & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Conduit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest producer in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of steel conduit, was accused of organizing 230 voters at the meeting to block approval in the code of a competing plastic conduit. The charge was made by <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and its Carlon division, which makes electrical conduit from polyvinyl chloride, a plastic. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is a private organization that adopts the National Electrical Code of safety regulations on which must state legislation is based. Indian Head said Allied illegally restrained trade in violation of federal antitrust laws. A federal jury awarded $ 3.8 million and the amount, as provided by law, was tripled. A federal judge threw out the judgment. But it was reinstated last year by the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in upholding the appeals court ruling, refused to extend protection from antitrust suits it established in 1961. The justices ruled then that railway companies did not violate antitrust law when they conducted a public relations campaign for legislation aimed at placing the trucking industry at a disadvantage. Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> dissented today. The case is Allied Tube vs. Indian Head, 87-157.

 A former southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> sheriff who admitted buying the job for $ 100,000 was sentenced today to a maximum of 7 years in federal prison. Former <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> `` Eddie'' <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> also was fined $ 10,000 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haden </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON>, 45, pleaded guilty in April to one count of mail fraud, one count of tax evasion and one count of conspiracy to buy the sheriff's job from then-Sheriff <PERSON> Johnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, who says he gave some of the $ 100,000 to county commissioners to approve the arrangement, is serving a 14-year federal prison sentence. <PERSON> Haden </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> to 2 years in prison on the mail fraud count, in which <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> admitted backdating a check for an insurance policy to cover an accident involving his son. <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> was sentenced to 5 years on the conspiracy charge, which stemmed from the sale of the sheriff's office, and 3 years on the tax evasion charge, in which he admitted failing to report income from the sheriff's job. The 2 - and the 5-year terms are consecutive, while the 3-year term will be served at the same time <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> had faced a maximum of 13 years in prison and $ 351,000 in fines. As part of his plea agreement he resigned as sheriff, forfeited all pension and fringe benefits, and gave up all property obtained with the proceeds of his criminal activity, prosecutors said. Also today, former <ORGANIZATION> Mingo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 63, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to buy votes, which carries a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine.

<HEAD>Court Rules Postal Service Must Pay Interest to Missouri Letter
Carrier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, ruling that the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is similar to a private business, said today the service must pay interest on back pay owed to a worker who won a lawsuit charging it with illegal discrimination. By a 5-3 vote, the court ordered interest on back pay for a letter carrier in <LOCATION> Chesterfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, who was fired and later ordered rehired. Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, writing for the court, said when the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was reorganized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1970 into the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> it became in key respects more like a private enterprise than a government agency. The reorganization launched the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> into the commercial world, specifically allowing it to sue and be sued, <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said. `` It follows that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is presumed to have waived any otherwise existing immunity of the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> from interest awards,'' he said. The court ordered interest paid to <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeffler </PERSON>, who was fired from his job as a letter carrier after 10 years. His superiors said <PERSON> Loeffler </PERSON> violated a rule dealing with the organizing of so-called box-holder mail that is sent to `` current occupant'' at an address and does not carry the resident's name. For a period in 1979 and 1980, letter carriers were not allowed to sort the box-holder mail in separate compartments of their carrying bags before beginning their routes. They were required to leave the third class mail in bundles and sort it out at each point of delivery. <PERSON> Loeffler </PERSON>, who worked in a rural area, openly refused to obey the rule as did two female letter carriers. One of the women was suspended and threatened with dismissal. The other woman was warned but was not otherwise disciplined. <PERSON> Loeffler </PERSON> was fired when he was caught breaking the rule the fourth time. He sued the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> under a 1964 civil rights law banning sex discrimination in employment and a federal judge ruled in his favor. <PERSON> Loeffler </PERSON> was awarded $ 91,871 in back pay and was ordered reinstated. But the 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled that <PERSON> Loeffler </PERSON> was not entitled to interest the back pay would have earned from the time he was fired until he won the suit. Such interest generally is authorized for those who win anti-discrimination suits under the 1964 act. The appeals court said the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was immune from the interest payments because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had not passed a law specifically eliminating the service's protection against such civil rights suits. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said today's case could affect hundreds of employment discrimination cases pending against the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Dissenting from the ruling were Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did not take part in the ruling. The case is <PERSON> Loeffler </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, 86-1431.

 African <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Govan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, freed from a life prison term last year, has been banned from being in the company of more than 10 people at a time, his attorney said Monday. The government order against <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, 77, will keep him from attending any large rallies or meetings supported by the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, the main guerrilla group fighting the South African government. <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> had already been prohibited from addressing meetings, giving interviews or leaving the area near the city of <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>, where he lives. The new order limiting the number of people he can be with is a common measure used by the government to censure anti-apartheid activists. <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Jana </PERSON>, said another of her clients, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> co-president <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, was served with similar new orders. Mrs. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, wife of imprisoned <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, was one of 18 black activists whose movements and speech had already been restricted in February. Also in February, the <ORGANIZATION> UDF </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of anti-apartheid groups, was banned from all activity, along with 17 other anti-apartheid organizations. Mrs. <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> filed a court challenge to the first restrictions placed on him but will have to refile the appeal under the new regulations. <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> was freed last August after serving 23 years for a 1964 conviction on charges of sabotage. Under South African apartheid, the nation's 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate schools, districts and health services.

 Chinese factories and offices have at least 20 million excess workers, and the situation is costing the government billions of dollars each year, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The news agency quoted an official in charge of personnel affairs as saying that overstaffing costs the state about $ 16.2 billion a year, equal to half the total revenue the state receives from enterprises each year. He said many employees spend working hours playing cards or watching television. At one 800-person factory in <LOCATION> Shijiazhuang </LOCATION>, northeast <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, employees were found to work only four hours during an eight-hour shift, he said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, with an urban work force of 120 million, has cited low productivity and surplus workers as major obstacles to its drive to modernize industries and make them more profitable. But the government is also committed to keeping unemployment at the present stated level of 2 percent and has said it must create 30 million new jobs by 1990 just to keep pace with the expanding work force. Factory managers have been given authority to dismiss unproductive workers, but it is very rare for workers to be fired for loafing on the job.

 A Hungarian woman who was decorated for helping Jews and anti-fascists in wartime <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has been expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for investigating the disappearance of a war criminal, a source said Monday.

<TEXT>
 A subcommittee of the nation's largest Presbyterian body today voted overwhelmingly to recommend adoption of a major policy statement on nuclear war. The revised paper on `` Christian Obedience in a Nuclear Age'' was scheduled to be considered later today by a full committee of the 200th <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> of the Presbyterian Church -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- The subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peacemaking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> ended almost four days of at-times contentious debate with a 15-1 vote to recommend adoption of the statement. The subcommittee revised the original proposal to make it clear Presbyterians considered obedience to government the normal course, and to soften language that now declares nuclear deterrence immoral. The subcommittee adopted a writing team's fine-tuning of the policy to agree with earlier changes in recommendations. Meanwhile, the full assembly today took up some internal issues, including commissioning of missionaries. Other issues remaining for discussion by the denomination's highest body include pornography, abortion and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s treatment of Palestinians in its occupied territories On Sunday, the statement on nuclear war was revised to say a Christian `` normally'' should support the government, and nuclear deterrence is immoral `` as an end in itself.'' The 630 delegates are scheduled to take up the report Tuesday evening, the day before the assembly ends. `` We Presbyterians will study this issue to death, while the rest of the world moves on,'' said subcommittee member <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Reindl </PERSON>, an elder from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, an elder from <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, however, said the paper, and the five-year process that preceded its writing, had led to much debate in the 3 million-member denomination. If the intent is to make peace, especially within the denomination, Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said, `` then let the people sitting beside me in the pew have a chance to look at this.'' Reservations in the subcommittee centered around fears the paper elevated tax resistance and civil obedience above obedience in the church's eyes and promised financial support to those who engage in resistance. However, the revised paper retains declarations that nuclear war is immoral, and says, `` The policy of nuclear deterrence has been in danger of becoming an end in itself rather than an interim measure of self-defense. Such a policy as an end in itself is not morally defensible. The work for peaceful alternatives needs to be vigorously pursued.'' Supporters of the original paper expected the full committee to restore some of the recommendations, including discussions of corporate support, financial and otherwise, for tax resisters. Other issues awaiting assembly action included a recommendation that the church call for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to end its `` repressive'' occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and that the church ask the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to stop aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that subsidizes settlements in the occupied territories. Also Tuesday, commissioners face what is expected to be a hotly contested election for stated clerk, the officer responsible for the operation of the assembly. The Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, 60, has been stated clerk or interim co-stated clerk of the denomination since it was formed in 1983 by the reunion of the Northern and Southern branches of the Presbyterian church. Previously, he held the office in the Presbyterian Church -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> -RRB-, the Southern church, for 10 years.

 When <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> overcame his reluctance to talk about the possibility of being <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> senator gave the interview to a newspaper he is sure the <LOCATION> Massaschusetts </LOCATION> governor reads every day _ The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. Frequently mentioned in speculation about the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nomination, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has been cautious in indicating his interest _ but he is interested. His response to the question of whether he would even accept the offer is delicately phrased: `` I probably would not accept,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> earns a spot among possible nominees because some judge him the perfect balance on a ticket with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: _ A conservative Southerner with the liberal Northeasterner. _ An expert on defense with an expert on domestic policy. _ A senator with a governor. `` The best in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> would be <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>,'' said state party chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. `` He's strong on national defense ... and he's perceived to be very intelligent. Because of <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s expertise in defense and foreign policy, former <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> and others have even talked of <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> being vice president and secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, an unprecedented double role in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. `` That would be the only reason that he would want to give up the chairmanship, a major substantive role ... to basically sit around an inquire into the health of both his own president and leaders of other countries,'' <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> carefully encourages that by contrasting his clout in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> with the vice president's role: `` You have tremendous potential power, but you do n't have power ... Unless you had some unusual understanding as to what you're going to be _ which I do n't think would be easy to work out for me or anyone else _ I think there's just a very definite problem there. But there is a long list of reasons cited by critics that <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> should not be on the ticket. In general, positions he has taken have caused consternation among various Democratic groups. Civil rights is at the top of the list, and has become a particularly thorny matter with Democratic runner-up <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> pressuring <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the issue every day. `` <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> represents the Old South,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for Women from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> voted in 1975 against bringing up the legislation to renew the Voting Rights Act. When the law was up again for a vote in 1982, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> voted for amendments that critics said would weaken the legal protections. In 1980, he voted to continue a filibuster that killed new federal powers to fight housing discrimination. He voted against an extension of time to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. He supported a constitutional amendment that would overturn the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision legalizing abortion and leave the matter up to each state. Such criticism irritates <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>. `` I do n't enjoy it. I do n't like it. I do n't want my children to read 10, 15, 20 years from now that <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> was against civil rights. That's just absolutely false,'' he told the newspaper. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s aides say that each of his votes was on the specific matter at hand, and often dealt with procedural considerations. For example, aides said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> voted against the ERA extension because it would not allow states to withdraw a previous ratification vote. On the fair housing bill, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> argued he did n't want the federal government being both judge and jury on alleged violators Whether or not <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would object to <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> on the ticket is not known, but his aides quickly started boosting <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> as an alternative choice when <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s name was first mentioned. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> also has a long record of support for many of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policies. Congressional Quarterly, an independent magazine, ranked <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> as the most frequent supporter of the president among <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 and 1985, never dipping below a 58 percent level in votes on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> issues. `` He's too conservative for me,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> Sigrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Freese </PERSON> of <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>. `` He's more Republican than Democrat.'' And there are a series of specific issues on which <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> disagree. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> voted for aid to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says that policy is illegal. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> voted for the MX missile, which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes. He voted for a balanced budget amendment and the Gramm-Rudman law requiring automatic spending cuts in 1985. In 1986, the liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> a 30 percent rating, while their counterpart, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> union gave him a 55 percent mark. A thoughtful and careful politician, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> has sometimes been called dull, a word applied to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as well. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> has little use for such criticism. `` It would bother me if I felt audiences I spoke to felt that ... I never had that impression,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> told the newspaper. `` I could become very controversial by just saying a lot of stupid things and the media would say, ` Where did you get all that charisma?' But then, in two years I would n't be back up here.'' There is also the question of just what <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> could bring the Democrats in the South. One poll in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> suggested adding <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> to the ticket was worth only one precentage point of the vote in the fall. A Charlotte Observer poll in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> found a Dukakis-Jackson ticket trailing a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush-Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> GOP team by five percentage points. But a Dukakis-Nunn ticket trailed by 13 points.

<TEXT>
 Radicals hurled tear gas grenades and firebombs at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic office Monday, and thousands of students battled riot police to protest the blocking of a march to the North Korean border. Riot police kicked and punched street vendors in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and threw tear gas to disperse a march by about 1,000 of the merchants, news reports said. The vendors accused authorities of hurting their businesses in efforts to clean up the city for the Olympics. Police and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said students tossed three firebombs and two tear gas grenades at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION> before they were seized by police guards firing tear gas. Police said only three students were involved in the attack in <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, 150 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, but local press reports said there were up to 10 attackers and that they also hurled two homemade bombs. The reports said six windows were broken and the office's sign was set on fire. The attack followed a wave of violent anti-government and anti-U.S. protests in the past two weeks by radical students demanding an end to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> influence and the removal of about 42,000 American troops stationed here under a mutual defense pact. Few South Koreans support the radicals, who also are demanding reunification of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. In the western port city of <LOCATION> Inchon </LOCATION>, about 3,000 university students yelling `` Yankee go home!'' and anti-government slogans hurled firebombs and rocks when police fired barrages of tear gas to stop them from marching off their campus. The Korean news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said about 1,200 students from eight schools attacked riot police with firebombs and rocks at a university campus in the southern city of <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>. No injuries were reported in the campus clashes. The protesters demanded that the government release students arrested Friday in major street clashes across the capital. Those battles broke out when riot police blocked thousands of students trying to march to the North Korean border for talks with northern students on reunifying <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. There was more violence Sunday when riot police clashed with thousands of students during a funeral march for a radical who committed suicide in an anti-government protest. The students burned Olympic flags during the funeral march. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> is the host of the 1988 Summer Olympics, which begin Sept. 17. The radicals back <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s demand to be a co-host of the Games. Police said Monday that 600 of the 908 students arrested Friday had been freed and that 229 others were facing minor charges. Police charged 47 students with assault or with violating national security laws. `` Ensure our life!'' street vendors shouted as they marched in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> after a rally at <ORGANIZATION> Sungkyunkwan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. News reports said at least five vendors were injured when police moved in to disperse them. The reports said one vendor was seriously hurt by a punch in the face. The vendors shouted anti-government slogans and accused authorities of cracking down on their street stalls to keep the streets clean as part of beautification and urban renewal projects for the Olympics.

 A former aide to House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was quoted today as saying he thought working on a book written by his boss was `` part of my job'' rather than the volunteer project described by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON> said, `` I did think it was part of my congressional job. That was my understanding at the time, and I still think that.'' The statement by Cossolotto, published in the <LOCATION> Forth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB- Star-Telegram, contrasts with statements by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who said today that <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON> had volunteered and that the important thing was the aide gave full value for taxpayers' dollars `` It is common practice for people on the staff to help in preparation of articles, books and speeches,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters, adding that such action is proper if the writing involves matters of public policy. `` Was that -LRB- Cossolotto's work on the book -RRB- public work? I think it can be argued that it was.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> earlier defended his actions in back-to-back appearances Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' Last Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee announced it was starting a preliminary inquiry into allegations of conflicts of interest in <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s financial dealings. Some of the allegations center on the book written by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, `` Reflections of a Public Man.'' According to reports Sunday in the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> newspaper and in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, one <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> businessman said he bought 1,000 copies of the book as a legal way to give money to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and bypass limits on campaign contributions. Cossolotto was on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s staff at the time and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON> worked on the book on his own time, rather than while he was supposed to be at his job. But Cossolotto disputed that. `` I never understood it -LRB- the book -RRB- to be personal time. Nobody ever said this was a project to be done around personal time. It was pretty clear.'' Cossolotto, now in private business in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said of the fact that his statements differ from <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, `` I do n't want to characterize it as a conflict.'' `` I do have a recollection of it and the speaker has a recollection of it,'' he was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said Sunday the congressional investigation of his financial dealings wo n't hamper him in his role as chairman of next month's Democratic National Convention. `` There is no cloud over my head, no sir,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat said. `` I've done nothing unethical, nothing illegal, nothing violative of the rules of the House.'' Other allegations concern <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s political efforts on behalf of several <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> businesses. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the allegations are `` a partisan political ploy'' by Republicans seeking to deflect attention from ethical violations by current and former members of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` It's a partisan ploy and it will be revealed to be a partisan ploy,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said on the CBS program. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, when asked if he would step down from the chairmanship of the party's convention if asked, said, `` I do n't expect to.'' `` I have n't done anything dishonest or illegal,'' he said. `` I'm convinced I have n't violated any rules of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> `` I may have done some things, at one time or another in my career, that were bad judgment,'' he said. `` But whatever mistakes I've made have not been dishonest mistakes.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> refused to say if he thinks the ethics investigation should be conducted by an independent counsel, rather than the committee. `` I do n't have a preference,'' he said. `` I'm not trying to tell the committee how to do its business,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` I asked them to look into it thoroughly. I asked them to do it promptly. Now, anything that can be done is fine with me so long as it gets the facts out and gets them out soon. `` I want this resolved and I'm convinced that the resolution is going to be that I have n't violated any rules.'' The committee's inquiry was originally suggested by Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., one of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s harshest critics in the House But the panel said its investigation will be wider in scope than that suggested by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received a 55 percent royalty totaling about $ 55,000 on his book. Questions have been raised about <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s use of a congressional staffer to work on the book, purchases of the book by friends and lobbyists, and about the royalty percentage, which is higher than those usually paid to authors. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said `` there was nothing wrong with the contract'' and joked that ` the royalty proceeds are going to my favorite charity _ Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and me.'' The book was published by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a friend of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> who also received large printing contracts from <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s re-election campaign `` I think it's a good book,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, while acknowledging that it contained little that was new. `` It's not fresh stuff,'' he said. `` Most of it is reprinted from speeches, articles, newsletters, memoirs. Little vignette style, so they're self-contained.'' The Times and Star-Telegram articles Sunday concerned purchases of the book by <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Payte </PERSON>. <PERSON> Payte </PERSON> said he bought 1,000 copies at a cost of $ 6,000 because federal election laws limit individual campaign contributions to $ 1,000 for each election. `` If I wanted to help <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and wanted to give him some money, I could n't do it,'' <PERSON> Payte </PERSON> told the Star-Telegram. `` But I could buy his books.'' Payte, who has known <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> since he entered <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1955, said he bought the books `` to show my appreciation'' to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and that he encouraged other <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> business executives to do the same. Asked about such reports, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> answered, `` I did n't sell these books.''

<HEAD>Attacks on Dukakis Sure to Increase</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As the long primary season ended, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had few scars from his battle for the Democratic presidential nomination. But now comes the hard part. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> clinched the nomination without becoming the target of a lot of criticism from within his own party. When criticism did come, it was from a rival on the left in fellow Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and from the right in Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. That left <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the best position of all: the middle. Also, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made it this far without the intensely negative campaign coverage that hit some of his presidential rivals, according to experts who are studying television coverage of the race. Now, though, `` It's finally one-on-one,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who lost his bid for the Republican nomination, `` and that's bad news for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' It may or may not be bad, but it will be different. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signaled that last week when he took the gloves off in trying to reverse <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lead in the polls. He lashed at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as an `` old-style 60s'' liberal with views `` born in <LOCATION> Harvard </LOCATION> yard's boutique. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, has n't officially locked up his party's nomination But he has entered a new phase of his presidential race in which he is one of the final two players and inevitably will draw the intense scrutiny such a position brings. `` I think he'll get a round of very tough press before the convention,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, who helped <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> through these same waters in 1984 as campaign manager. `` Any mistake he makes will be magnified.'' That's a certainty, says <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a government professor at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a student of presidential campaign press coverage. `` Whenever someone emerges from a pack into a two-person race, that person's coverage always becomes more negative,'' he said. `` It's never not happened.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' character and background have already come under extensive examination in television and newspaper stories. Two biographies have been published. But there'll be more attention to such accounts now, and to stories questioning the validity of anything he claims or contends. He takes at least partial credit for the economic boom in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Look for stories examining the loss of manufacturing jobs in that state and pointing out current budget problems. Look for examinations, too, of the personal side of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: the cool way he deals with some people, suggesting to some an insensitivity. And look for criticism of his bland speaking style. What <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sees as positive will be a negative to some: his seemingly vague talk of `` partnerships,'' his calling, without specifics, for `` good jobs at good wages _ and I mean good wages.'' `` People are going to be talking about how incredibly bromidic he is. He's cliche-ridden,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` It's going to be a story now: ` Does <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> say anything?''' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON>, who is conducting a television-coverage study at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit reasearch group, says <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has fared `` better than you'd expect for a front-runner.'' `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> missed being treated as a front-runner,'' <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> said. `` He went right from being treated as a co-front-runner with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to being the winner. ... I would be astounded if his coverage does n't become more critical in the next couple of months.'' Republican political consultant <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON> says polls show even partisan Republicans have not yet reacted negatively to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ an indication, he says, that they have n't begun paying attention to the race yet. He says <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' press coverage shows that Republicans and other critics have held their fire. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> adds that in part that's because <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` has been in hiding,'' avoiding a lot of exposure to the press and risking his lead. `` Now there's going to be an active effort on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> surrogates to say, ` Hey, this is what the guy says but look at his record,''' <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON> said. Still, <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON> and others suggest <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is in a strong position to weather increasingly tough examinations _ unless some skeletons are unearthed, or he commits some gaffe that supports the doubts critics are trying to raise. `` It's like in basketball _ he's been able to get a couple big feet planted in the center,'' said <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON>. `` You ca n't get him out of there now by bumping him. Somebody's going to have to plow into him and take an intentional foul.''

<TEXT>
 People extradited from foreign countries to face criminal charges here can not avoid defending themselves against related civil lawsuits filed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. The justices ruled unanimously against <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cauwenberghe </PERSON>, a Belgian citizen who is trying to avoid having to defend himself against a $ 19 million lawsuit in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The court said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cauwenberghe </PERSON> has no right to appeal, before any trial is held, the authority of a Los Angeles-based federal court to preside over the lawsuit. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cauwenberghe </PERSON> was sued by another Belgian, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Biard </PERSON>, who lent $ 1 million to a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> real estate partnership engaged in renovating a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> townhouse complex. According to court papers, <PERSON> Biard </PERSON> was repaid $ 800,000 of the loan and accused <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cauwenberghe </PERSON> of fraud. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cauwenberge </PERSON> also was convicted in federal court in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> of wire fraud and related charges. He was sentenced to time already served in pretrial confinement and was ordered to pay Biard $ 34,501 in restitution. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cauwenberghe </PERSON> had been arrested while on a trip to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and was extradited to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. In seeking to have <PERSON> Biard </PERSON>'s civil lawsuit dismissed, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cauwenberghe </PERSON> argued that the Belgian courts are a more convenient forum for the civil case, and also that extradited individuals are immune from such suits. A federal judge refused to dismiss the suit and the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said it was premature for it to hear <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cauwenberghe </PERSON>'s appeal. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed that any such appeal by <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cauwenberghe </PERSON> can wait until after the trial is completed. Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, writing for the court, said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cauwenberghe </PERSON>'s freedom is not at stake in the case. Van Cauwenberghe can not be imprisoned or required to post bail in a civil suit and, in fact, is not even required to be present at the civil trial. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cauwenberghe </PERSON>'s right to challenge the outcome of the lawsuit can be vindicated after there is a judgment in the suit, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. The case is <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cauwenberghe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Biard </PERSON>, 87-336.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Drozak </PERSON>, president of the 80,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Seafarers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> since 1980 and a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, died at his home from brain cancer, labor officials said Monday. <PERSON> Drozak </PERSON>, 60, who had been hospitalized several times in the past 18 months for cancer treatments, died Saturday. Despite his illness, he had remained active in the union. Just last fall, he had lobbied extensively for legislation that would have required 11 Kuwati tankers operating under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to be manned by <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> crewmen. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the measure. But the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, citing national security interests, used an exemption in it to allow the reflagged tankers to be staffed mostly with Filipino crews who are paid about one-fourth the $ 30,000 to $ 35,000 annual wage of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> seamen. <PERSON> Drozak </PERSON> assumed the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Seafarers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> at a time when its membership was suffering large layoffs due to an overcapacity of ship bottoms in the world, new technologies that reduced the size of crews needed on each vessel and a large decline in the size of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchant marine fleet. Of the union's 14,000 active deep sea seamen, only about 7,000 hold active jobs now, according to union officials. Beginning as a shipyard worker at the age of 16 in Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Drozak </PERSON> worked his way up the union's heirarchy in the 1950s and 1960s, first as an organizer in Mobile and then as a port agent in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. He was elected a vice president of the union in 1965 and was put in charge of its contracts covering the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> coasts, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> and inland waterways in 1972. In 1980, <PERSON> Drozak </PERSON> was elected to succeed <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> as the Seafarers' president and also as head of the 44-union <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. A year later, he was named an <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> vice president and to one of the 35 seats on the labor federation's policymaking executive council. <PERSON> Drozak </PERSON> is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON>; a daughter; a sister; a brother; and three grandchildren. Funeral services will be held Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> Seafarers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seamanship </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Piney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, Md.

 <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> L'Amour </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most prolific storytellers whose frontier tales of gunfighters, lawmen and drifters enthralled millions of readers from waitresses to presidents, has died He was 80.

His work far transcends the Western novel genre.'' <PERSON> L'Amour </PERSON> wrote 101 books, nearly all of them Westerns, including `` Hondo,'' `` The Iron Marshal,'' `` The Quick and the Dead,'' `` <PERSON> Sackett </PERSON>'s Land,'' `` Down the Long Hills'' and `` Ride the Dark Trail.'' Nearly 200 million copies of the books are in print; his works were translated into 20 languages. More than 45 of his novels and short stories were made into movies, including `` Hondo,'' `` Burning Hills,'' `` Heller in Pink Tights'' and `` Stranger on Horseback.'' Stars cast in L'Amour Westerns included <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON>. <PERSON> Applebaum </PERSON> noted that perhaps his best-known novel, `` How The West Was Won,'' was based on the movie screenplay. <PERSON> L'Amour </PERSON> was a writer who paid scrupulous attention to accuracy. `` If he said that the cowboys went over a hill and to the right was <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, then there was <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. He researched it from heck to breakfast,'' retired newspaperman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said Sunday. `` He would travel widely to check out the geography, the way people talked,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said from his farm in L'Amour's hometown of <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION> `` If you start reading his books, you wo n't quit. It gets ahold of you and grabs you'til the end. He was that good a writer.'' `` He always said he was just a storyteller, in the ancient folk tradition of people sitting around the fire, just telling stories,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wershba </PERSON>, a New York-based television news producer who knew <PERSON> L'Amour </PERSON> for more than a decade. <PERSON> L'Amour </PERSON> dispelled myths about life in the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, such as townfolk fleeing the bad guys. Many of the actual settlers, he noted, were Civil War veterans not deterred by gunplay. `` I go to an area I'm interested in and I try to find a guy who knows it better than anyone else. Usually it's some broken-down cowboy,'' <PERSON> L'Amour </PERSON> once explained in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm actually writing history. It is n't what you'd call big history. I do n't write about presidents and generals,'' <PERSON> L'Amour </PERSON> said. `` I write about the man who was ranching, the man who was mining, the man who was opening up the country.'' Although he was the first novelist to win the congressional Gold Medal, and received the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION>, he never won a top literary award. But that did n't bother him. `` He never really paid critics and literati that much mind,'' <PERSON> Applebaum </PERSON> said. `` He received thousands of fan mail -LRB- letters -RRB- every year. They were the critics that counted.'' <PERSON> L'Amour </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION> when he was 15 for what he later called his `` yondering'' years, picking up such odd jobs as prize fighter, tugboat deckhand, longshoreman, lumberjack, prospector, miner, circus roustabout, fruit picker, elephant handler and amateur archaeologist. As a result, he was largely self-educated. In later years, he lectured on such campuses as the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He said that he `` wanted to write almost from the time I could walk.'' He became a prolific contributor in the 1940s and 1950s to pulp magazines. After World War II, he used the pen name <PERSON> Tex </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> because, he recalled, `` no editor believed that the name <PERSON> L'Amour </PERSON> could ever appear on a Western story.'' He used his real name after his first novel, the 1953 `` Hondo,'' was made into a successful motion picture starring <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>. `` Hondo'' was followed by 85 novels, 14 short story collections and one non-fiction book. His readers included Presidents <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who read `` <PERSON> Jubal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sackett </PERSON>'' while recovering from surgery in 1985. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, sent a telegram to <PERSON> L'Amour </PERSON>'s widow expressing their `` heartfelt sympathy'' on the author's death. `` He brought not only millions of hours of enjoyment to readers but the best descriptions of American history,'' former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said in a telephone interview today. `` One of the last requests he made of me was a signed copy of my last book, ` An Outdoor Journal.' We used to swap books all the time, but I always got the best end of the deal.'' L'Amour received the congressional gold medal in 1983 and the Medal of Freedom from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the following year. Two L'Amour books are scheduled for release this fall: `` Lonigan,'' a short story collection, and `` The <ORGANIZATION> Sackett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companion </ORGANIZATION>,'' a non-fiction account of his research for his 17 novels devoted to the fictional <PERSON> Sackett </PERSON> clan. In addition to his daughter, <PERSON> L'Amour </PERSON> is survived by his wife of 32 years, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON>, and son, <PERSON> Beau </PERSON>.

 The glorious summer sound of ice cream truck bells may no longer be heard in one <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb. <LOCATION> Schaumburg </LOCATION>'s village board is considering a ban on Good Humor and other ice cream trucks in residential neighborhoods in the northwestern suburb.

 How much would you pay for scotch and champagne that had been aging undisturbed for 75 years in dark, cold storage _ in a shipwreck at the bottom of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION>? At a rare wine auction this past weekend, people bid up to $ 90 a bottle for scotch and champagne recovered from the wreck of the SS <PERSON> Regina </PERSON>, one of 19 ships that sank in the Great Lakes in the great storm of November 1913. `` It's a novelty, my father is a scotch drinker,'' said <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, who paid $ 180 for three bottles of <ORGANIZATION> Whyte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Mackay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scotch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whisky </ORGANIZATION> intended as a Father's Day present. `` I do n't drink, but some of my divers tried some samples which were in very good condition despite being underwater for 75 years,'' said commercial diver <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusate </PERSON>, who discovered the wreck in July 1986 while searching for a tugboat that sank in the late 1960s. About 300 bottles of French champagne and Scotch whisky have been salvaged from the <PERSON> Regina </PERSON>, a 249-foot Canadian freighter that served the coastal towns of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION> with packaged goods until it went down in 80 feet of water with all 27 crewmembers on Nov. 9, 1913. Several thousand more bottles still rest in the wreck roughly 3 -LCB- miles offshore from <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sanilac </LOCATION>, about 80 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brusate </PERSON> said. `` Most freighters on the Great Lakes carried coal, iron ore and tons of wheat, but this was like a general store,'' said <PERSON> Brusate </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. The 60 bottles sold Saturday by <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auctioneers brought a total of $ 3,460, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, vice-president of <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s wine division Among wines that did not come from the ship, the highest price at the auction was $ 1,600 for a 1875 Chateau Mouton-Rothschild. About 100 people attended. <PERSON> Deanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Chan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Regina </PERSON>'s salvagers, said she was a bit disappointed the bids were n't higher. `` It's a piece of our history, a collector's item,'' she said. A wine collector, Dr. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritikin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bridgeview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, bought six bottles each of the <PERSON> Regina </PERSON>'s champagne and Scotch. `` We'll store some and drink some,'' said <PERSON> Pritikin </PERSON>. `` We sampled some of the champagne and it was quite good. ... The constant, cool temperatures helped preserve it.'' <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON>, a representative of <ORGANIZATION> Clicquot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>, bid $ 85 for a bottle of 1906-1908 vintage <ORGANIZATION> Veuve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clicquot </ORGANIZATION> for the champagne company's museum in <LOCATION> Reims </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> Other items salvaged from the <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> have been auction to help finance further salvage operations, which are to resume next month, <PERSON> Brusate </PERSON> said. He estimated that only about 10 percent of the ship's cargo has been recovered so far. The search will concentrate on finding the ship's safe, which reportedly contained $ 86,000 in gold coins, worth at least $ 2 million at current bullion prices, Ms. <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> said. The gold was believed to have been the payroll for workers building the <LOCATION> Sault </LOCATION> Ste. Marie locks between lakes Superior and <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION>.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner skid off a runway after landing at <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, and four of the 82 people aboard sustained minor injuries, officials said. The accident occurred late Sunday as Flight 187 from <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, landed, and resulted in a 15-minute closure of the airport, authorities said. The extent of damage to the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 was not determined, although there was no fire and no damage to the fuselage was visible. The passengers used emergency chutes to evacuate, said airport spokeswoman <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON>. Afterward, two people complained of back pain and were taken away by ambulance, Ms. <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> said. One person received a bruised knee and one a sprained ankle, she said. The airplane veered off a runway and came to a rest on a grassy strip dividing <LOCATION> Sea-Tac </LOCATION>'s two parallel runways, said police spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliadis </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators were checking to determine if the plane blew a tire upon landing or had struck debris on the runway, officials said. `` It was a fairly normal flight until we landed,'' said <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION>, one of 75 passengers. `` I saw the white line and we kept going over it. And then I saw smoke or dust or something,'' she said. `` I could n't tell if it was smoke or dust, but I was n't waiting around to see. `` It was very scary.'' She said the plane had been on the runway 5 to 10 seconds before it veered off. She praised the flight's seven crew members for quick action in getting the passengers off the plane. `` It seemed to me like about 30 seconds from the time we stopped to the time the stewardess threw the door open and yelled to evacuate,'' she said. The airport was closed to aircraft for about 15 minutes, but re-opened with one runway, <PERSON> Eliadis </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> officials were not immediately available for comment.

 Prosecutors have reopened their investigation into the murder of a 70-year-old woman who left most of her estate to the ministry of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> television evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. McLennan County District Attorney <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Feazell </PERSON> said Sunday that his office renewed the investigation because of a reporter's new information that could help him resolve what he called `` unanswered questions'' about the December 1983 slaying. The inquiry into the murder of <PERSON> Ida </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON> was not targeted at <LOCATION> Swaggart </LOCATION> but could involve `` one or more individuals connected with the <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> Ministries at that time,'' said <PERSON> Feazell </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON> was found stabbed and beaten with a wheelchair footstool and died later at a <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION> hospital. Her husband, <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON>, died of heart failure five days after her death. The couple, in their will, left all but 25 percent of their cash only, not to exceed $ 25,000, to the <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, television minister. A Swaggart spokesman estimated the estate's size at between $ 500,000 and $ 800,000. In April 1984, <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Euna </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> was convicted of murder in the case and sentenced to 99 years in prison. <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON>'s son contested the will, charging that associates of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> ministries exercised `` undue influence'' on his parents to change their will. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Neale </PERSON> <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON> said two men working on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> had recommended Ms. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> to take care of Mrs. <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON> later dropped his charges. A source familiar with the case told the <ORGANIZATION> Waco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune-Herald </ORGANIZATION> a settlement was reached between <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> Ministries. A reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enquirer </ORGANIZATION> approached <PERSON> Feazell </PERSON> with new information he had developed independently, said the prosecutor, adding that parts of it `` have been substantiated.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today cleared the names of three prominent old <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamenev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinoviev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Radek </PERSON>, who died in the 1930s during the purges of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. The court, said the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, `` is returning to these tragic figures their honor and their names'' as part of the campaign to stimulate more open discussion of key issues in Soviet political life and to dismantle the system created by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. The three men were as important in their time as <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON>, an old Bolshevik rehabilitated in February. But exonerating <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> was considered more crucial politically because his economic theories were similar in key respects to reforms being attempted by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The rehabilitation of <PERSON> Zinoviev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kamenev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Radek </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> made clear, was meant to reassure Soviets they would not be punished for expressing political views. Tumultuous discussion is forecast at a nationwide <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference, starting June 28, which is to debate proposals to expand the reforms. The persecution of the old <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, `` is an urgent item for today.'' `` We are learning democracy, mastering the rules of political discussions, `` We are learning democracy, mastering the rules of political discussions, also in a time of hard struggle,'' the newspaper said in a long article on page three under the headline, `` A Return to Truth.'' <PERSON> Zinoviev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kamenev </PERSON> spent years in exile with Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> before he led the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. They were elected to the ruling bodies of the <ORGANIZATION> Bolshevik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after the revolution, and sided with <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> against his arch-rival, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>, after <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> died in 1924. After <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> was forced into exile, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> turned on his former allies, and <PERSON> Zinoviev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kamenev </PERSON> were convicted of treason and executed following a show trial in 1936. <PERSON> Radek </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, took part in the 1917 revolution, was accused of siding with <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> and expelled from the party in 1927. He was later rehabilitated, and edited <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> in the 1930s. He was tried again in 1937 and sent to a labor camp where he is thought to have died. <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> was murdered in exile in 1940 in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and has not been rehabilitated. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, printing a detailed account of the purges and their prelude, said that `` our predecessors, the people of the 20s, could not control the situation ... and were burned up in the flames of repression.'' `` They preached intolerance toward the opinions of their opponents and gave birth to physical and moral terror. And the oppression of those who were left in the minority led to a situation in which one man crushed the majority.'' `` A lack of the very notion of personal opinion created that wild ` crowd syndrome', which sanctified any tyranny in the name of the people.'' `` In a word, discussion has been cut off for a long time about the paths toward the building of socialism. It has been restored now, more than a half century later, and from the same place; about the paths of developing revolution, about the role of the party and about the place, of ` the ruler,'' or Vozhd in Russian. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> was known as the `` Vozhd,'' or supreme leader. In reversing the decisions against <PERSON> Zinoviev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kamenev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Radek </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said, `` the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, naturally, did not discuss the ` party face' of rehabilitated citizens, and did not evaluate whether they were right or wrong in the old debates. But it said clearly: they are innocent before the law, state, and people.''

<TEXT>
 The husband of this city's anti-drug crusading mayor says there is nothing wrong with his handling real-estate affairs for a convicted drug smuggler. Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, husband of Mayor <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, set up a corporation for convicted smuggler <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiken </PERSON> in 1985 and served as the corporation's registered agent. <PERSON> Kiken </PERSON>, who was twice convicted on federal marijuana imporation charges in 1974, is awaiting trial in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on new drug charges in the attempted importation of 165,000 pounds of marijuana in 1985. <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>'s former law partner, <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, represented <PERSON> Kiken </PERSON> after his 1974 convictions. Since then, <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> has been a trustee for property <PERSON> Kiken </PERSON> owned in nearby <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION>, has arranged a loan for <PERSON> Kiken </PERSON> and later handled the sale of the property, the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petersburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. Freedman, a corporate and real estate lawyer, prepared financial and legal documents that named <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> the trustee for the <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION> property, and prepared the papers for the sale of the property. Both <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> say they knew of <PERSON> Kiken </PERSON>'s 1974 convictions, but said they were unaware of any activities alleged in the latest indictment. Both defended their roles in helping <PERSON> Kiken </PERSON> manage his business affairs. `` I do n't see anything wrong with it,'' <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Friday from <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, where he and the mayor are vacationing. `` Just as I have no hesitation in saying to you that someone accused of criminal conduct is entitled to representation, if an individual wants to buy a piece of property or set up a corporation, I've never felt it appropriate to inquire whether it was going to be for a legitimate purpose or if that person had some ulterior motive.'' <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, `` It looked like the guy had turned legitimate and was successful in that regard and there was no reason to question it.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, who has been mayor since July 1986, has made a war against drugs one of the hallmarks of her administration. Last month she announced `` Operation Crackdown,'' the bulldozing and burning of 50 rundown buildings that attracted crack dealers. Mrs. <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> said her husband would never knowingly represent a drug smuggler in business transactions. `` My husband's integrity, his ability to tell right from wrong, certainly makes me very confident that he's going to do the right thing in every circumstance,'' she said from <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> on Friday. <PERSON> Kiken </PERSON> was arrested March 30. A federal indictment accuses him of conspiracy and aiding and abetting the attempted importation of 165,000 pounds of marijuana aboard a barge in October 1985. The load was worth an estimated $ 50 million.

 A South African lawyer whose arm was blown off in an April car-bomb explosion alleged Monday that the South African government planted the bomb as part of a death campaign against <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members. South African officials denied it. <PERSON> Albie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, 53, is a white member of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, the main guerrilla group fighting the South African government. The exiled attorney said the government was responsible for the April 7 attack in the <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>. `` It was an arm, almost certainly the military arm, of <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, who spoke in a television interview from an undisclosed location in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` They've been doing it in many parts of the world. They've threatened to kill <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> people wherever they might be anywhere in the world,'' said <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, who looked ill as he spoke, with the stump of his arm still bandaged <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> was also burned and his eye injured in the explosion. `` They are the only people who have the possible motivation and capacity for this kind of thing,'' he said.

At the time of the blast, <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> was employed by the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The television station said <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> has been living in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> under an assumed name. The South African Embassy in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> denied government responsibility for the attack. `` The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is on record as having advocated a policy of violence ... it's very possible this policy has extended to members of the organization itself,'' said Minister <PERSON> Justus </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Goede </PERSON>, the No. 2 diplomat at the embassy. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to topple the South African government and its policy of apartheid, under which the nation's 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs and the 5 million whites control the economy and dominate government.

 Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions taken Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. VACCINE The court ruled the government may be forced to pay damages when a vaccine it licenses causes the disease it was intended to prevent. By a 9-0 vote, the justices rejected <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration arguments that the government always should be shielded from lawsuit in such cases. The case is <PERSON> Berkowitz </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-498. SENTENCING The court agreed to judge the constitutionality of a new sentencing system for people convicted of federal crimes. At issue in the sentencing case is whether the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Sentencing Commission's rules that took effect Nov. 1 may stand or must be thrown out. The validity of the commission itself is at stake, also. By the time the court announces its decision, expected sometime in 1989, thousands of defendants will have to be resentenced _ regardless of which way the court rules. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Mistretta </PERSON>, 87-1904. POLICE AUTHORITY The court armed police with new authority, ruling that officers sometimes may chase someone who starts running at the sight of them even though they have no reason to suspect criminal conduct. It unanimously ruled that <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> prosecutors may use as evidence the drugs dropped by a man who started running when he spotted a police cruiser on a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> street. The case is <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> vs. Chesternut, 86-1824. RACIAL DESEGREGATION The court declined to study an unprecedented racial-desegregation case, refusing to free <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, officials from having to integrate city schools and build subsidized housing to overcome decades of discrimination. The court, without comment, left intact rulings that <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> must build subsidized housing in predominantly white sections of the city and create `` magnet'' schools to reduce segregation. The cases are <ORGANIZATION> Yonkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-1632, and <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-1686. FRAUD The court agreed to decide whether the government may use a 19th Century anti-fraud law to impose stiff civil fines on top of criminal penalties for the same offense. The court said it will hear an appeal by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials seeking to fine the manager of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> medical laboratory $ 131,170 for defrauding the government of $ 585 on Medicare bills. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Halper </PERSON>, 87-1383. POSTAL SERVICE _ The court ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is similar to a private business and said the service must pay interest on back pay owed to a worker who won a lawsuit charging it with illegal discrimination. By a 5-3 vote, the court ordered interest on back pay for a letter carrier in <LOCATION> Chesterfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, who was fired and later ordered rehired. The case is <PERSON> Loeffler </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, 86-1431. DIRECT MAIL The court barred states from banning all direct mail advertisements sent by lawyers to potential clients. The court, by a 6-3 vote, ruled in a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> case that states violate free-speech rights when prohibiting lawyers from soliciting business by sending truthful and non-deceptive letters to people they know face particular legal problems. The case is <PERSON> Shapero </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, 87-16. DUPONT-LAROUCHE The court rejected the appeal of a <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> family fortune heir declared mentally incompetent after he loaned $ 212,000 to a group linked to political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>. The court, without comment, let stand rulings that control of <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> duPont <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s $ 8 million estate properly was taken from him in 1985 under <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s guardianship law. The case is <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 87-1753. HUMANIST The court turned down the appeal of a philosophy professor denied an opportunity to address <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about secular humanism during the lawmakers' daily moments of opening prayer. The court, over one dissenting vote, refused to hear arguments that the professor's rights were violated. The case is <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 87-1581. CHILD SUPPORT The court told <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s highest court to restudy the case of a teen-ager born out of wedlock who says she should be allowed to seek support payments from her father's estate. The justices said the <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> should review its ruling that a $ 4,600 settlement between <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON>'s parents after she was born bars her from seeking any additional money The case is <PERSON> Gernardt </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 87-1103. ANTITRUST LAW The court ruled that companies may violate antitrust law when they lobby private organizations that play a prominent role in influencing business legislation. The 7-2 decision upheld a $ 11.4 million jury award against a company accused of `` packing'' a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> when the organization adopted a safety code for electrical wiring. The case is Allied Tube vs. Indian Head, 87-157. EXTRADITION People extradited from foreign countries to face criminal charges here can not avoid defending themselves against related civil lawsuits filed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. The justices ruled unanimously against <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cauwenberghe </PERSON>, a Belgian citizen who is trying to avoid having to defend himself against a $ 19 million lawsuit in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The case is <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cauwenberghe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Biard </PERSON>, 87-336.

 <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and a federal appeals court both refused today to stop Tuesday morning's scheduled execution of convicted murderer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON> The decisions were released as <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, his attorneys and prosecutors gathered at the state prison in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> for a hearing before <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s newly appointed <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s pleas for a reduced sentence of life in prison.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called today for `` a joint venture'' between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other industrialized democracies to strengthen economic policy coordination, open more markets and ease the debt burden of poorer nations. Previewing the points he will push at the seven-nation economic summit commencing Sunday in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said that finding `` a common offensive'' against money laundering and drug trafficking is of utmost importance. In a speech prepared to the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a group that makes policy recommendations on the development of democracies around the world, the president also said there should be greater efforts to restore the economies of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used much of his speech to extoll the virtues of his own economic policy of lowering tax rates, easing government regulation and otherwise encouraging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business investment, and said he believes that many of the other industrialized democracies have begun to follow the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pattern. `` This new consensus -LRB- on economic growth strategy -RRB- has not only brought the economies of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and so many other countries roaring back,'' he said, `` it also has opened the way for coordination of economic policy among the summit countries that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will join the leaders of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> at the economic summit in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. In his speech today, the president made it clear he thinks the summit partners should move with greater speed on the question of agricultural subsidies. The summit runs from Sunday through Tuesday and will be <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s last. `` In no field do we have more weeding to do than agriculture, where subsidies cost the consumers and the taxpayers of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> $ 200 billion a year,'' he said. The president noted that agriculture has been a principal item on the agenda of the so-called `` Uruguay Round'' of trade talks, but said not enough has been accomplished there. `` Those talks were scheduled to go for four years. They are now nearing the half-way point,'' he said. `` It's time to narrow down and lay out specific goals, a road map and a timetable to the finish line. `` In <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, we, the heads of the major industrial states, can push our ministers to have that job completed by year's end. No excuses.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it will decide the fate of a new sentencing system for federal crimes that some judges have refused to adopt. At issue are <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Sentencing Commission rules that took effect Nov. 1. The validity of the commission itself likely is at stake also, and a decision is expected sometime in 1989. More than 50 federal trial judges have refused to use the new sentencing rules, declaring them or the commission unconstitutional. But dozens of their colleagues have imposed sentences under the new rules. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, citing the `` intolerable uncertainty'' caused by the conflicing rulings, urged the justices to resolve the issue even before any federal appeals court has ruled on it. Today, the justices granted the administration's speeded-up appeal. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the court's action pleased him. `` It is vitally important that these issues are resolved by the court as quickly as possible,'' <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> said. By the time the court announces its decision in a test case from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, thousands of defendants will have to be resentenced _ regardless which way the court rules. If the justices uphold the system, those defendants sentenced by judges who refused to apply the new rules will have to be resentenced. If the justices invalidate the system, those defendants sentenced under the new rules will have to be resentenced. The commission estimates that by Jan. 1 more than 10,000 federal court defendants will have been subjected to the new sentencing system. The commission was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, legislation aimed at eliminating disparities in sentences. The law empowers the commission, with seven members appointed to six-year terms by the the president, to tell federal judges what sentences, within certain ranges, should be imposed for various crimes. Three of the commission's members must be federal judges. The commission's rules _ called `` guidelines'' even though the 1984 law makes them binding on all federal judges _ eliminated parole and curtailed credit for good behavior. Judges who have struck down the new sentencing system have ruled: _ That <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> avoided political accountability by unconstitutionally delegating its legislative power to the commission _ That the commission, because it includes members of the judiciary and holds legislative power, violates the Constitution's separation of powers _ That the new rules violate defendants' due-process rights by curbing too severely the sentencing discretion of judges In urging the justices to uphold the sentencing commission's authority, lawyers for the commission said the 1984 law `` reflects a massive interbranch commitment to the creation of ... a major improvement in the administration of justice. The test case accepted for review stems from the prosecution of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mistretta </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiring to possess and distribute cocaine after his arrest last December in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. Before <PERSON> Mistretta </PERSON>'s sentence was imposed, he challenged the new sentencing rules. A trial judge dismissed the challenge, and sentenced <PERSON> Mistretta </PERSON> to 18 months in prison, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. <PERSON> Mistretta </PERSON> then appealed to the 8th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers asked the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to decide the case while it is pending before the appeals court.

 <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> remembers the good old days when she had her husband of 47 years, Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, all to herself. Now she competes with one of the busiest social schedules around. `` I did n't realize it, but I guess the best years of my life were the years we spent together before he was an elected official,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, 69, said in an interview Monday in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times. The wife of the four-term mayor, who is seeking an unprecedented fifth term next year, said she's lucky to dine with <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> once a week, and catches up on his well-being by watching local television news. After years of following in his footsteps, she said, she grew weary and gave it all up. `` I get tired of meeting these same people after 25 years ... People talk to him all the time,'' she said. The mayor admitted time with his wife is limited, but said he sets aside three special nights every year. `` Her birthday, my birthday, the Academy Awards,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. `` Those are absolutely inviolate dates.''

 It took <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> 16 years and $ 16 million to find his sunken Spanish treasure. Now some of the booty is going on the auction block at <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, as divers continue to comb the site and preservationists painstakingly scrape centuries of marine crust off the riches. `` This auction is particularly exciting because the pieces recovered enhance knowledge of the New World,'' said <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s publicist <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> `` There's been a lot of public interest'' in the two-day sale which begins Tuesday, she said. In July 1985, <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>'s crew found the vast mother lode of the <LOCATION> Nuestra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Senora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atocha </LOCATION>, the richest of five Spanish galleons dashed to the ocean floor about 40 miles west of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> by a hurricane in 1622. So far, the galleon has surrendered more than 4,000 emeralds, 150,000 gold and silver coins, fine jewelry and thousands of ceramic pieces. Also dredged up were thousands of pieces of salt-soaked wood, rusty navigational devices, muskets, tools, pots and pans and other artifacts. More than 300,000 salvaged pieces of the ship or its cargo have been logged in computer records. Each piece is tagged, drawn to scale, cleaned of calcium and seashell deposits, catalogued, again drawn to scale and photographed. The 389 lots to be auctioned this week belong to <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> or investors who received the treasures in return for their financial backing. Among baubles up for bid are a 5 -LCB- - foot gold chain valued at $ 200,000, a $ 150,000-to - $ 200,000 silver-gilt wine cup and jewelry salvaged from the Atocha or its sister ship, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Margarita </LOCATION>, also sunk in the 1622 <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> says he hopes to buy back some of the treasures for his museum in this town at the tip of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>. `` There's been a tremendous amount of paperwork'' since his crew found the <PERSON> Atocha </PERSON>'s treasure, said <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, 65, who oversees his non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Mel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> began his search for the Atocha about 1970 The effort was marked by financial troubles and court battles, and <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>'s oldest son and daughter-in-law were killed when their tugboat capsized during a 1975 search In 1982, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected the state of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s bid to keep a quarter of the salvor's haul <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> estimates there are at least another $ 100 million worth of artifacts from the Atocha remaining on the ocean floor. `` 1985 was just the beginning. We're going to be working for years and years. The stuff takes forever,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McGarry </PERSON>, executive director of the museum, which shares quarters with <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>'s treasure restoration facility. The museum's $ 10 million displays, gleaned from the Atocha, <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON> and from a British slaving ship found during the quest for Spanish treasure, range from dishes to gold bars to a $ 1.13 million gold necklace studded with diamonds, rubies and pearls. But <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> is n't content to count his Spanish treasure. The former <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> dive-shop operator now dreams of building <ORGANIZATION> Treasure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION>, a $ 140 million resort and research complex in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. The government of <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION> has agreed to a 99-year lease on its isle of <LOCATION> Barbuda </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> plans to build a 400-unit hotel, a treasure museum, preservation facilities and an underwater restaurant. After a year of exploring the area, his crews have found an unidentified shipwreck and the bones of a British vessel. `` It'll never end,'' said <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, a treasure hunter since age 9 and one of the divers combing the Atocha site. `` I'm going to go out tomorrow and find more stuff for them to clean up.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> denounced the government of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on Monday as a `` racist state,'' using the strongest language yet of any high <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official toward the apartheid regime. His remark, which came a day after Democratic platform writers agreed to castigate <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a `` terrorist state'' in their 1988 party document, seemed calculated to put distance between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and administration policies on the subject. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, like President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said he does not favor breaking diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. It was the second day in a row that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought to highlight his views on civil rights issues. In a speech Sunday at predominently black <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wilberforce </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would campaign for a `` positive civil rights agenda'' and suggested that his priorities would be different from those of the administration _ including more federal support for minority businesses and more assistance for the disadvantaged. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, talking Monday to reporters in the Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House, was asked if he agreed with the Democrats' decision to brand <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state, a characterization sought by defeated Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I think it's a racist state, regrettably, and I think we ought to do what we can by staying engaged and trying to figure if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> can use its moral influence to change that situation,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied. `` I do n't favor breaking diplomatic relations,'' he said. The Democrats, who held a platform-drafting session over the weekend in <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, have not indicated whether they would seek to break relations with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In the past, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said he personally considered the system of apartheid, or white minority rule, in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` repugnant.'' But the president initially resisted imposing economic sanctions on that nation, going along with the sanctions only after they won wide bipartisan support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration disagreed with the description of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a terrorist state. `` We believe the best way to influence policy in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is to stay engaged,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He briefed reporters at the same time that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was answering questions, and the subject of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments did not come up <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is spending this week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and has no campaign appearances planned, met with reporters to announce the naming of two senior aides, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> as communications consultant and <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> as campaign press secretary. <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> political consultant, was the campaign spokesman for the Reagan-Bush ticket in 1984. Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> is a former spokeswoman for <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. After announcing the appointments, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stayed on to answer a wide range of questions and even joked that he had offered a spot on his ticket to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential thoughts have been a hot topic. `` I saw <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> the other day. ... I said, ` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, I do n't think you're going to make it on the Democratic ticket. Are you interested?''' `` And he turned to his mother, and he said, ` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has done a good job as vice president. I might keep him on.' And that's all I know about the <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> situation. On possible Democratic platform fights, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` That's their problem That's the problem of the Democrats. The issues, regardless of what happens, are going to be so clear in the fall _ the differences _ that I think what I've got to do is do my part ... and not intervene in that Democratic convention process at all.'' `` I do n't think it would be right for me to get involved in the Democratic convention and to say what ought to be done about <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. He ran a good race. He stayed in there. He came up when there was a lot of feeling that he was n't going to do as well as he did, and I'll give credit for that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said there were no immediate plans for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to join his campaign team. `` I'm comfortable with the situation at present,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He and I have been friends for so long. I see him a lot, so I'm getting the benefit of his advice as it is.'' Republican sources have said they expect <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to join <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign this summer However, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporter, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview on Friday that no decision would be made at least until after the economic summit in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> later this month.

<TEXT>
 Two basketball stars-turned-congressmen introduced legislation Monday requiring colleges to give prospective students athletes an idea how they'll fare in the classroom as well as on the playing field. Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillen </PERSON>, D-Md., former teammates on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knicks </ORGANIZATION> professional basketball team, introduced the `` Student Athlete Right-to-Know Act. The law would require all colleges accepting federal financial help to compile and report scholastic statistics regarding student athletes. The data would be collected by the secretary of education and made available to students and their parents for use in choosing a school. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and <PERSON> McMillen </PERSON> said the act is aimed at encouraging high-school students to weigh academic standards, not just athletic prospects, as they chart their futures. All too often, the ex-basketball players said, students pick a college on the unrealistic hope that they're on their way to a career in professional sports. But since very few students make it to the pros, picking a college by its academic credentials makes more sense, according to <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and <PERSON> McMillen </PERSON>. `` Most people do n't get that ticket to the pros,'' said <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, who attended <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on an academic scholarship. He and <PERSON> McMillen </PERSON> acknowledged the bill would do little to address abuses by college athletic recruiters, or to stop colleges from holding athletes to lower academic standards than other students. But, <PERSON> McMillen </PERSON> said, the measure would assist students trying to make well-rounded judgments about their educations. `` The idea here is to provide a snapshot ... a balance sheet of the university's academic picture,'' said <PERSON> McMillen </PERSON>, a graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>. The act would require schools to report graduation rates for all students with academic scholarships, broken down by sport, sex and race. The education secretary would be required to publish the information. The law also would require students to acknowledge reviewing a school's academic data before signing a letter of intent to enroll. Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Towns </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a co-sponsor of the legislation, said, `` If we can have reporting as to the on-time arrivals of airlines, surely we a can let student athletes know whether they are likely to receive a useful college degree.''

 A faculty panel at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> has recommended that a white professor accused of making a racist remark to a black female student be reinstated but be barred from teaching freshmen. The recommendation is not binding on the president. The five-member panel, which included four whites and one black, unanimously cleared <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Towery </PERSON> of three charges of violating state Board of Regents policy, said <PERSON> Towery </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Towery </PERSON>, an English professor, also was cleared by a 4-1 vote on a fourth policy-violation charge, involving the racial comment; <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, the only black on the panel, dissented on that vote, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said Sunday The panel, however, recommended that <PERSON> Towery </PERSON> not be assigned to teach freshman classes, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. The student involved in the case was a freshman. `` I feel that we were vindicated,'' the attorney said. <PERSON> Towery </PERSON>, who has taught at the school for 18 years, declined to comment. <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>, the professor of business who was chairman of the panel, said the group deliberated about 20 hours Thursday and Friday before completing its report to <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Capitan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> declined to discuss its contents. College spokeswoman <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotnick </PERSON> said <PERSON> Capitan </PERSON> postponed a scheduled trip to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> so he can review the report. <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, who received a copy of the report Sunday, said the panel found <PERSON> Towery </PERSON> innocent of immoral and obscene conduct, default of academic integrity and failure to carry out assigned responsibilities to students. Ms. <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> dissented from the panel's fourth finding that <PERSON> Towery </PERSON> was innocent of racial or sexual harassment, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. The case was initiated after freshman <PERSON> Ginevra </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Towery </PERSON> called her `` a black bitch.''

The bill covering the ballasts that start and operate fluorescent lights was given voice-vote approval and sent to the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, where it is being opposed as unnecessary. The measure is an amendment to the 1987 law that required efficiency standards for a variety of large household appliances. The administration also opposed that legislation, but President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed it following its overwhelming approval by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy estimates that with at least 50 million fluorescent ballasts sold annually, more efficient units could save 7,000 megawatts of electricity by the year 2000 along with $ 11 billion in lower lighting costs to consumers. The president's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> said many ballasts already meet the proposed standards and the bill would impose unnecessary burdens on industry and force consumers to pay more for ballasts. The bill and the 1987 law resulted from a coalition of energy conservation advocates and electrical and appliance manufacturers, who began backing national standards after a handful of states began setting their own.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Monday opened lines of communication with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in his first meeting with a top Roman Catholic official, but both sides said a papal visit and diplomatic relations are not imminent. Asked by reporters about a possible visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, the Soviet leader said, `` For that, a lot still has to happen.'' Cardinal <PERSON> Agostino </PERSON> <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s secretary of state, told reporters his meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was `` warm'' and `` friendly.'' But <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON> added: `` We have not arrived at the point of speaking about diplomatic relations of any sort. ... The question of any invitation to the Holy Father was not raised.'' He said that as a result of his meeting with the Soviet leader, `` we can raise questions about the life of Catholics, which was difficult before because there were no direct contacts. This possibility has opened up.'' He did not say how the contacts would be maintained. <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON> said statements by Soviet officials about allowing greater religious liberty are important, especially if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> intends to allow believers to express their beliefs openly instead of merely allowing them `` internal freedom of conscience.'' Cardinal <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Willebrands </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s Secretariat for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>, said Soviet officials appeared more willing to recognize that there are religious groups in their country `` with a point of reference outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' The Russian Orthodox Church and most other religious groups recognized by Soviet authorities are based in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, making it easier for the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to control them. Strict laws prohibit religious groups from doing charitable work, require them to be registered with the government and sharply restrict religious education. Officials say the laws are being rewritten to reflect <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to reform Soviet society. <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON>, leading a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> delegation at celebrations of the Russian Orthodox Church's 1,000 th anniversary, carried a letter from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON> said the pontiff expressed the desire in his letter for regular contacts with the Soviet government. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> also expressed in general terms its concern over the naming of bishops and the establishment of a seminary for Ukrainian Catholics. The Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> was forcibly integrated into the Russian Orthodox Church in 1946 by <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> but has survived underground since. It has not been recognized by authorities and therefore is illegal. <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willebrands </PERSON> met last Friday with five bishops and priests of the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Russian Orthodox Church officials, who are opposed to official recognition of the Ukrainian church, have said they will discuss this with <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> representatives later this month. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON> shook hands in the meeting room in the Council of Ministers building in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> and then sat down at a table with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and interpreters. They did not discuss the letter before reporters, who were present for the first couple of minutes of their meeting. Instead, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> asked if <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON> had been cold in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The cardinal said he knew what kind of weather to expect since he had been to the Soviet capital in 1971. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he had been to <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials told reporters that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> read a Russian translation of the papal letter during the meeting. Members of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> delegation, the highest ever to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, will travel to <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> this week for continued celebrations of Christianity's anniversary.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, sketching his agenda for the seven-nation summit in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, called Monday for a joint effort to restore the battered economies of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and an international crackdown on money laundering from illegal drugs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said he would prod world leaders to complete negotiations by the end of the year to cut back on agricultural subsidies, which cost an estimated $ 200 billion a year in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` It's time that we in the summit nations forget about quitting time and join in a great ` venture to progress' _ a joint venture that opens the international marketplace and that also strengthens the weak links in the international economy,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a private group dealing with foreign policy. On Sunday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will fly to <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> for his eighth and final summit with the leaders of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Billed as an economic summit, the meetings invariably focus heavily on political issues, as well. With a presidential election in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and Wall Street still skittish after last October's collapse, the summiteers are expected to steer clear of controversies and emphasize areas of agreement. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed that the summit nations `` join together to help restore the economies of two countries: one, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, a heroic democracy ravaged by communist-led insurrection; the other, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a victim of brutal aggression.'' He did not offer any specific proposals. The administration has been talking with congressional leaders _ as well as with officials in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ about the desirability of a multi-year assistance program for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, as well as a program to stimulate trade and investment there. The amount of funding and details of the program have not been decided. For <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the administration has earmarked $ 119 million for resettlement of Afghan refugees. In his speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also proposed a joint effort to help countries of sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> work out their debt problems. `` ` We will take up their problems, as we have those of other debtor nations, on a case-by-case basis, working to help develop economic policies that promote growth and opportunity,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the summit nations also should `` join together to attack the lifeblood of one trade that should never be part of international trade, the international narcotics trade. `` At this summit, we should join in a common offensive against money laundering and the flow of drug profits through the world's financial institutions,'' the president said He did not spell out how he would attack the problem. On the economic front, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> extolled the virtues of his own policies, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had led the way in persuading other countries to cut tax rates, sell off state-owned industries and cut back on regulations. `` Starting with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` the summit countries have had nearly six years of uninterrupted growth. I'd like to make it 60 and more. He said that, `` In no field do we have more weeding to do than agriculture, where subsidies cost the consumers and the taxpayers of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> $ 200 billion a year.'' The president noted that agriculture has been a principal item on the agenda of the so-called `` Uruguay Round'' of trade talks, but said not enough has been accomplished there. `` Those talks were scheduled to go for four years. They are now nearing the half-way point,'' he said. `` It's time to narrow down and lay out specific goals, a road map, and a timetable to the finish line. `` In <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, we, the heads of the major industrial states, can push our ministers to have that job completed by year's end. No excuses.''

However, unless the cat is a roadside attraction, there are no laws that regulate it, she said. `` There's nothing in the law that prevents you from having an exotic animal in your back yard,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Jergensen </PERSON>. `` I could have an elephant in my back yard tomorrow, and there is n't a thing anyone could do about it.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Monday passed legislation to require the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey to study the impact of geothermal development on Yellowstone National Park, home of the nation's most famous geothermal sight, the Old Faithful geyser. The provision, in a bill sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by voice vote, is a response to complaints from conservationists that proposals to tap underground steam deposits near the park could disrupt Old Faithful and other geothermal features. The bill would amend a 1970 law that permits the government to lease land to people trying to convert geothermal steam into electricity. The bill would extend beyond 15 years the amount of time a leaseholder has to develop a project.

 Millions of dollars in corporate `` soft money'' is pouring into the political system through state entities that can accept big donations that are banned on the federal level, a private group said Monday. The Center for Responsive Politics complained there is no way of knowing whether the money quietly finds its way into congressional and presidential elections, where spending is strictly limited under the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Federal law prohibits any corporate or union money in federal campaigns, and limits individuals' contributions to $ 1,000 per candidate. But many states have no limits on individual contributions and permit labor and corporate contributions to state parties. The state party then can spend the money on voter outreach efforts, such as voter registration and state conventions, that can end up helping candidates for president or <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as well. Such funds are known as soft money. The Center For Responsive Politics, a non-profit, bipartisan group, said it could document $ 3.3 million in soft money contributions from corporations during the 1985-86 election season in five states. `` There is currently no way to precisely determine the extent to which soft money is in fact being used to finance federal as opposed to state activities,'' the report said. Most of nearly 1,700 soft money contributions disclosed were from corporations. Fewer than 10 were from labor unons, and those donations were in the $ 100 to $ 200 range, the study said. It listed top givers as <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, which gave $ 85,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, and <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, which gave a total of $ 89,000 to the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and Republican parties. The largest individual contribution identified by the center was from <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, chairman of the board of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, who gave $ 100,000 to the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> GOP. According to public records cited by the center: In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, the top-dollar donor was <ORGANIZATION> CCS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> systems </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> which gave $ 30,000 to the Republicans; in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, S.W. <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which gave $ 20,000 to the Democrats; in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bruce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which gave $ 34,082 to the Republicans, and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which gave a total of $ 42,700 to both parties. The group said it was not accusing any corporation or labor union of illegality, since such contributions are legal in the states studied, but it said there is a potential for abuse. Soft money is not required by law to be reported at the federal level. And only some states have strict reporting requirements. `` We have no idea how the soft money is mixed with the hard money,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the group's executive director. `` We do not know for what purpose the moeny was given or how it was used.'' `` It gives individuals and corporations and labor unions one more avenue to flex their muscle with candiates and parties.'' Noting that <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> reports document nearly a billion dollars in spending in congressional campaigns and presidential races, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, `` Lying just below the surface are untold millions of additional dollars unaccounted for by the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>.'' For this year's presidential election, each national political party plans to raise soft money to augment the maximum $ 8 million it is allowed to spend to elect its nominee. In addition to the party expenditure, each candidate gets $ 46 million from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> to wage his campaign. The finance chairman for likely <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says he wants to raise $ 42 million in soft money for the fall campaign. Based on reports filed with the five states involved in the new study _ <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ the center identified the following amounts in corporate contributions to state parties in 1985-86: <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>: Republicans, $ 808,290; Democrats, $ 295,389. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>: Republicans, $ 645,888; Democrats, $ 71,050. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>: Republicans, $ 466,445; Democrats, $ 458,258. Missouri: Republicans, $ 369,482; Democrats, $ 22,400. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: Republicans, $ 129,776; Democrats, $ 31,250. The center's report noted that <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> heir <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroc </PERSON> gave $ 1 million to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> a few months ago. At most, $ 20,000 of that could be used on federal elections under the law, meaning at least $ 980,000 would go into the <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION>'s soft-money accounts. The report also noted published reports of gifts to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of $ 150,000 from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Trammell </PERSON> <PERSON> Crow </PERSON>, $ 127,600 from <ORGANIZATION> Phillip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and $ 124,000 from <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Richfield </LOCATION>. Soft money also can go into national party funds for construction of party buildings. The report said the Democrats got $ 50,000 from the painters' union, $ 10,000 from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and $ 5,000 from the machinists' union for its building fund. It cited contributions to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> fund of $ 40,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> and $ 24,120 from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Burnham </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>.

 Israeli and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> intellectuals signed a `` peace treaty'' in a symbolic ceremony Monday after months of arguments and said their example shows that gaps between the two sides can be bridged. `` If clods like us, who are not always very good at taking action, can do it, so can politicians,'' said one of the signatories, Israeli poet <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zach </PERSON>. They said the agreement, written in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION>, Arabic and English, was the first of its kind to be negotiated by Israelis and Palestinians. It was signed by about 25 Israeli and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> authors and artists during a news conference. Foreign reporters far outnumbered <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> journalists. `` The agreement was reached after many arguments,'' said <PERSON> Nissim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalderon </PERSON>, an Israeli poet. `` After 40 years of war and brutality, there is bitterness on both sides and demands on both sides that the other finds hard to cope with.'' The pact calls for the establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, to be called <LOCATION> Falastin </LOCATION>, in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` Falastin'' is how the word `` Palestine'' sounds in Arabic. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a key point of dispute, would be demilitarized and serve as the capital of both states. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Falastin </PERSON> would recognize each other's right to live in peace and security. The signatories are members of the Israeli and <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupation </ORGANIZATION>, the only professional group that includes both Israelis and Palestinians from the occupied territories. Most of the Jewish members are left-wing activists. <PERSON> Zach </PERSON>, for example, recently canceled the International Poetry Festival, which was to be held in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> this month, to protest the army crackdown on the Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands. <PERSON> Asad </PERSON> <PERSON> el </PERSON> <PERSON> Asad </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in the occupied territories, said the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> favored the terms of the treaty. `` We feel we are transmitting clearly and honestly the message of our representatives, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Asad </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, saying it is a terrorist organization. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> covenant calls for the destruction of the Jewish state, and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has refused to accept unconditionally <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions guaranteeing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to secure borders. <PERSON> Zach </PERSON> said the group would now seek the signatures of additional intellectuals in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the occupied territories.

 About three of every 1,000 patients at six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospitals are infected with the AIDS virus, but it has not spread extensively in the past year, according to a study released Monday. It indicated the infection rate among hospital patients is about five times higher than that among military recruits from the same cities but has not changed over the first 15 months of the study. `` The importance is that there has been a slowing in the rate of new infection,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dondero </PERSON>. `` The stable rate means it is not exploding.'' <PERSON> Dondero </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, heads the study program called the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sentinal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surveillance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. He said the infection rate seen at the six hospitals, four of them in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, probably is lower than the rate nationwide. If the rate at the hospitals were the same as the national figure, that would mean about 700,000 Americans carry the AIDS virus. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> officially estimates between 1 million and 1.5 million Americans are infected, and <PERSON> Dondero </PERSON> said he believes the true figure `` is closer to 1 million.'' Figures are based on anonymous blood testing of 18,809 hospital patients. Excluded from the tests was anyone who might already have the disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, including patients hospitalized for infections or cancer. Many of those tested were in the hospital for accidents, surgery or childbirth. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> plans to expand the program to 40 hospitals across the country. Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> state epidemiologist, said the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> study may have missed an increase in the infection rate because it did not sample enough people and did not choose a truly representative sample of the population. `` There is a feeling across the country that the infection rate in gay men is stabilizing and that it is still going up in intravenous drug users,'' he said.

 One or more people associated with <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> Ministries could be targets of a reopened investigation into the slaying of a woman who left part of her estate to the television evangelist's ministry. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Feazell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> McLennan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney, said Sunday his office is re-examining <PERSON> Ida </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON>'s slaying in December 1983 and that a National Enquirer reporter's new information could help him resolve `` unanswered questions.'' <PERSON> Feazell </PERSON> said the inquiry was not aimed at <LOCATION> Swaggart </LOCATION> but could involve `` one or more individuals connected with the <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> Ministries at that time.'' `` What we are looking into right now is the possibility of violations of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Penal Code that could include being a party to murder,'' <PERSON> Feazell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Euna </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> was convicted in April 1984 of murder in the case and sentenced to 99 years in prison. Mrs. <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON>, 70, of <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON>, was found stabbed and beaten and died later at a <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION> hospital. Her husband, <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON>, died of heart failure five days later. In their will, the couple left all but 25 percent of their cash, not to exceed $ 25,000, to the ministry in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. A Swaggart spokesman estimated the couple's total estate at between $ 500,000 and $ 800,000. <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON>'s son contested the will, charging that associates of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> ministries exercised undue influence on his parents to change their will. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Neale </PERSON> <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON> alleged that two men working on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> had recommended that Ms. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> take care of Mrs. <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON>. Later, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON> dropped his charges. The <ORGANIZATION> Waco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune-Herald </ORGANIZATION> quoted a source familiar with the case as saying a settlement was reached between <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> Ministries. <PERSON> Feazell </PERSON> said a National Enquirer reporter approached him with new information he had developed independently. `` The information was believeable and parts of it have been substantiated,'' he said. <PERSON> Feazell </PERSON> said his office had investigated a possible connection between the murder, the will and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> Ministries at the time of Ms. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>'s trial. `` Lot of questions came to light in the spring of 1984 _ unanswered questions that were n't pursued,'' he said. `` I met with <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s attorneys at that time. After meeting with him, I decided to take no further action,'' he said. <PERSON> Feazell </PERSON> said that `` as material becomes available, it could be presented to the grand jury'' during the next few weeks. `` It might be something we can wrap up rather quickly, or we could take a long time with it.''

<TEXT>
 Production of a vital oxidizer for the fuel of the space shuttle booster rocket resumed Monday, five weeks after the only other plant in the nation that made the chemical blew up a mile away. Fire inspectors were on hand at the <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant in nearby <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION> when workers began filling vats with chemicals to produce ammonium perchlorate, an oxidizer used in the solid-fuel shuttle boosters and some military rockets. <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON> said the inspectors would be at the plant until a dispute between the fire department and the company over storage of the finished chemical product is resolved. `` It's like a fire watch,'' said <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON>. `` We're going to have them out there 24 hours a day.'' <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON> refused to rule out the possibility of legal action against the company if it does not agree to fire department recommendations that it store the chemical in smaller piles and place the piles further apart than it currently does. County officials and a team of safety experts hired by <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> plan to meet Thursday to try and work out an agreement on the storage issue. `` We will ask some very pointed questions,'' said <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON>. `` They're going to have to come up with some reasons why they selected the way they did to store the product.'' Plant spokeswoman <PERSON> Annita </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON> said workers will be on the job in three shifts while the plant gears up to operate at its capacity of 36 million pounds of ammonium perchlorate a year. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said last week that they had only enough fuel for eight shuttle boosters, enough for four flights. Each set of boosters needs 1.7 million pounds of ammonium perchlorate mixed with its rubber-like fuel. <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> temporarily halted its production of ammonium perchlorate after a series of thunderous explosions May 4 killed two people, injured 326 and caused an estimated $ 73 million in damage at the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION>. After a brief reopening the next week, production was halted again under the threat of lawsuits by state and local officials until an independent safety team could inspect the plant. <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> agreed, among other things, to ship the chemical in containers less susceptible to heat and shock, and reduce by 50 percent its supply of unfinished ammonium perchlorate. The cause of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> blast is still under investigation. Company officials have said the blast may have been caused by a leaking natural gas line, but fire department sources said the most likely cause was a spark that set off ammonium perchlorate. <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON> said he would not speculate on when the department's formal report fixing the cause of the explosions will be finished

 An ex-sheriff who pleaded guilty to buying the job from his predecessor for $ 100,000 was sentenced Monday to seven years in a federal penitentiary. Former <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> `` was not motivated by personal greed or a lust for power,'' said <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON>. `` In a real sense -LRB- he was -RRB- a victim of -LRB- a -RRB- corrupt system. ... `` The crimes he committed were those of a stupid man,'' <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haden </PERSON>, adding that his client has a `` low intelligence quotient -LRB- and is -RRB- only marginally literate.'' <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON>, 45, pleaded guilty in April to one count of mail fraud, one count of tax evasion and one count of conspiracy to buy the sheriff's job from then-Sheriff <PERSON> Johnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>. In addition to sentencing <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> to five years on the conspiracy count, <PERSON> Haden </PERSON> also ordered him to pay a $ 10,000 fine. In addition, <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> was ordered to serve two years on the mail fraud charge, which stemmed from a scheme to obtain backdated insurance coverage for his son, who had been involved in a motorcycle acident. <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> also was sentenced to three years in prison on the tax evasion charge, but <PERSON> Haden </PERSON> said that sentence would run concurrently with his other terms. The former sheriff, who is scheduled to begin serving his sentence on Aug. 11, had faced a maximum sentence of 13 years in prison and a $ 350,000 fine. Under federal law he must serve a minimum of one-third of the seven-year sentence before he will be eligible for parole. <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> `` did not profit'' from his crimes, but rather, `` Mr. <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON>'s crimes are ... more crimes of the heart. `` <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> is a weak man further weakened by alcoholism,'' <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> told <PERSON> Haden </PERSON>, who emphasized that <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> pleaded guilty to a conspiracy count under the federal government's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act. <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> told the judge that he was sorry for what he had done and added that he had never taken a kickback or sold drugs to anyone in <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, who said he took the $ 100,000 from <PERSON> Hilbert </PERSON> and gave some of the money to county commissioners to approve the arrangement, is serving a 14-year federal prison sentence. Former County Commissioner <PERSON> Rastie </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> is scheduled to report to federal prison later this month for his role in the scheme. The other two county commissioners at the time also are under indictment. <PERSON> Haden </PERSON> on Monday also accepted a guilty plea from former <ORGANIZATION> Mingo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 63, to one count of conspiracy to buy votes. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who is to be sentenced Aug. 8, also has agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors.

<TEXT>
 A government brochure sent to more than 100 million households explaining in frank language how the AIDS virus can be spread is getting a good response, Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said Monday. The federal government mailing this spring was designed to reach every household in the country as part of a campaign to teach people how to avoid the risks of catching the fatal disease. `` I think that a number of people who planned to be shocked, who planned to criticize ... have been surprised that it is a good piece of education,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said at a news conference before he delivered a commencement address to graduates of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences-Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Most pleasing are reports of family discussions of the brochure, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said. `` People have heeded my request,'' he said. `` They have taken the family together and presented this to them as a problem that they all should understand.'' He also said there have been a `` tremendous number'' of calls to a hotline asking for the brochure in Spanish. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said no good way could be found to determine which households in the country would need the Spanish language version when the brochure was mailed. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> also cautioned against overreacting to what may seem to be new and frightening findings to be presented at the the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS which opened Sunday in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. `` Do n't be misled that that something has just happened in the last week and now we're in real trouble,'' he said. Dr. <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Kallings </PERSON>, a conference chairman, characterized some of the information in the papers as `` frightening.'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said AIDS continues to present a unique problem for people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a country used to seeing diseases conquered by science. `` I do n't see a vaccine that is both effective and readily available, as well as safe, in this century,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said. But he said that before the year 2000, scientists may develop a better agent to hold the AIDS virus in check, postponing, possibly indefinitely, deaths from the disease. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said teen-agers are among the toughest people to warn about AIDS, because they are, by nature, `` risk takers.'' He said that because AIDS symptoms often do not show up for years after infection, teen-agers may feel no fear because they do not see their friends dying from the disease. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the body's defenses against disease, leaving a person prey to life-threatening infections and certain cancers. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by infected drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. AIDS has struck more than 64,000 people in this country since 1979 and killed more than 36,000 of them, according to the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>.

 Five escapees, including a confessed double killer, were still at large Monday as more than 75 officers scoured the area for the men who cut their way from what was thought to be an escape-proof jail. Six detainees, including the confessed double killer in the so-called `` ninja'' slayings, escaped Sunday night from the Cumberland County Jail. They left in their wake two small hacksaw blades, an 8-inch-by-15-inch hole in a cell and a rope made of bedsheets hanging from a fourth-floor window, authorities said. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 20, who was being held on murder charges, was recaptured shortly after the escape and was treated for a broken leg or hip he suffered in a fall, said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON>, a spokesman for the sheriff's department. The others remained at large as officers with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION>, state <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> and nearby military installations fanned out to search the county. <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION> architect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> MacMillan </PERSON>, who designed the jail, said he was baffled at how the men sawed through the heavy-gauge horizontal bars. `` An ordinary hacksaw would not cut this material,'' he said Monday. `` I've seen demonstrations of it where they -LRB- try to cut -RRB- it with an electric hacksaw, but the thing just goes back and forth and it does not make any impression in the material. ... I'm really not aware that there was a hacksaw blade available that would saw the material.'' The escape apparently was spotted by a police records clerk who noticed someone drop from the center, <PERSON> Little </PERSON> said. Desk Sgt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Reihe </PERSON> gave chase but lost the suspects in the dark, <PERSON> Little </PERSON> said. Still at large Monday afternoon was <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, a 21-year-old former soldier at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION> who confessed to the stabbing deaths of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, 68, and his wife, <PERSON> Janie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutz </PERSON>, 62. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> was scheduled to appear in Superior Court Monday for a continuation of the sentencing phase of his trial, in which he may face the death penalty. The slayings came to be known as the `` ninja'' murders because <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> and accused accomplice <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, another former soldier at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, allegedly wore black clothes resembling outfits worn by Japanese assassins. The other escapees were: <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Pond </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, held in the slaying of a pawn shop employee; <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, held on a charge of first-degree burglary, assault on a female and larceny; <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnick </PERSON>, 22, of <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, held on charges of second-degree burglary, first-degree sex offense and common law robbery; and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 30, of <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, held on charges of felony breaking and entering.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is once again being hit by a wave of violent anti-government demonstrations and street battles between riot police and radical students. Here are answers to some questions on the latest unrest. Q. Why are there new riots in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>? Have n't elections and democratic reforms in recent months produced substantial changes? A. Many of the authoritarian controls on politics and many other aspects of South Korean life have been dismantled in recent months. The small, but powerful radical movement contends there has been no change and remains determined to overthrow a government it claims is a dictatorship. Radicals are fighting for an ill-defined `` democracy of the masses.'' The well-organized radical movement, which evolved during years of resistance to authoritarian rule, has become increasingly leftist and violent as it has split with moderate opposition forces over political goals in recent months. Q. Most of the protesters are described as students. Who are they and what do they want? A. Radical college students are the main strength of the protest movement. They constitute up to 10 percent of college students, with perhaps another 10 percent sympathizing with their ideas and aims. Many radical students are idealists seeking a perfect society in a nation dominated for most of its 40 years by military and civilian dictators. They see themselves as champions of workers, peasants and the poor. The radicals have little understanding of politics or ideology, partly because of strict government controls in the past on political education. They talk about true democracy and sharing wealth, but are vague or inarticulate on how to achieve their goals. Q. How serious is the unrest? A. The radicals lack public support and are not a serious threat to the government, but they are capable of causing trouble by violent tactics. The main problem is that they are helping continue the confrontational nature of Korean politics. Q. Why have the latest protests been mainly anti-American. Did n't the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> help the South during the Korean War? A. Radical students contend successive authoritarian governments have been able to rule the country because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing. Students say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a democracy has failed to push for democracy in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and other nations. The radicals also claim the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> enforces partition of the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> to control the South. The intensely nationalistic students resent the presence of 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and oppose the growing impact of American cultural influence. But the resentment aimed at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has so far had little impact on individual Americans. Q. How do the majority of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people feel about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and about the radicals' anti-Americanism? A. Most South Koreans are not anti-American. A majority are believed to support the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces as a defense against communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. But there is a growing belief among South Koreans that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tends to patronize its weaker Korean ally. This partly reflects the Koreans' growing prosperity and confidence and their desire for a bigger voice in the world. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade pressure to open up <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s markets to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> imports has also stirred resentment. Q. The students tried to march to the North Korean border for reunification talks. Is reunification possible? A. Radical students, who insist they are not communists, say reunification must be achieved at once. They claim the governments in the north and the south will be swept away and the peninsula reunited if the ordinary people of both nations simply join hands. But many South Koreans fear the North wants to impose communist rule. The North invaded the South in 1950 and the two nations technically remain at war since no peace treaty was signed. There seems to be little hope of reunification while the North remains one of the most repressive communist regimes in the world and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> becomes one of the fastest growing pro-Western capitalist nations. The peninsula was divided in 1945 when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet forces ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II. Q. Do the new protests pose a threat to the Summer Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in September? A. Some radicals are backing <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s demand to be a co-host of the Games as a way of promoting reunification. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have rejected the North's demand. The South Korean government is determined to make the Games a major success and any attempt to disrupt them would be suppressed by a huge security shield. But radicals may try to stage protests since world attention will be focused on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

 An <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> delegation hoping to improve U.S.-Soviet relations and reunite Eskimo families divided by the Cold War took off today on a `` friendship flight'' to the Siberian community of <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION>. The flight, aimed at cracking open a border closed for 40 years, left <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> at 11:09 a.m. -LRB- ADT -RRB- for <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said. Dubbed Friendship 1, the plane had left <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> at 7:55 a.m. for the 1 -LCB- - hour flight to the western <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>, the jumping-off point for the second leg of the trip, a 45-minute flight to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> The flight from <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> to the eastern <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION> is seen as a big step toward thawing relations between the neighboring regions, once part of the same country before <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> sold <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1867. Eskimos once freely crossed the icy <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> in motorboats and walrus-skin umiaks to trade and visit with relatives. The border was closed in 1948 amid growing Cold War tensions. This month, the Soviets approved today's one-time charter flight to <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION>, after two years of work by Alaskans promoting the idea. Eighty government officials, <PERSON> Eskimos </PERSON> and journalists were booked aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane for the 225-mile flight. <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION> officials planned to entertain the one-day visitors with tours, a banquet and a trip to an outlying native village. The flight is long overdue, says <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gologergen </PERSON>, 68, one of several Siberian Yupik Eskimos who are making the trip. `` This is the first chance to create peace towards our people and their people,'' he said. `` This way we'll have a chance to find out if the relatives are still alive there someplace and open up a little trade.'' <PERSON> Gologergen </PERSON> said his great grandfather migrated from <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and kept in touch with relatives there until `` the iron curtain came down.'' The `` friendship flight'' is part of a broader initiative that <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> business leaders, educators, and state officials have launched to improve relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Those efforts, combined with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of openness, have started to chip away at long-standing barriers. `` From a symbolic perspective, the trip represents the reopening of an old gateway between <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>, delegation leader. `` I'm confident it will lead to better relations between our two countries for years.'' The flight stems from the dream of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON>, a real estate agent in <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>. When <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s oil recession began two years ago, <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON> brainstormed ways to improve the economy of his remote town of 3,700 people. He figured that if the <LOCATION> Alaska-Siberia </LOCATION> border were opened, <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> could become an economic and cultural center for both sides of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>. In addition to freer travel by residents, <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON> envisioned increased trade, joint business ventures, and tourist excursions by airplane and cruise ship between <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. The barriers to such activity were _ and remain _ substantial. Though <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> lie only 3 miles apart at their closest point, the regions are a world apart politically and economically. Even a telephone call from <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> must be routed the opposite direction around the globe to reach <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION>. Officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, four time zones to the east, and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, 12 time zones to the west, seemed content with the status quo. So <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON> tried some attention-grabbing stunts. He floated balloons from <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> across the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> and pointed a huge Peace sign, in Russian, toward <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. He also wrote hundreds of letters to Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, urging the opening of the border. Slowly, people began to listen _ especially after <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the largest air carrier serving <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, hopped on the `` friendship flight'' bandwagon. `` It was only a short while ago that this flight was a dream,'' said <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Cancelmi </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` I personally wondered if this day would ever come. `` I do n't think <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON> ever thought for a moment that it would n't, and that's what it takes to make something like this come true.''

<HEAD>Top Military Leader Of Shining Path Rebels Captured</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONTE HAYES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police captured the top military leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION>, a Maoist rebel group whose eight-year guerrilla war has taken more than 10,000 lives in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, officials said Monday. Officials said the capture of <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Morote </PERSON>, 43, considered the most radical leader of the movement, was the hardest blow to date for the rebels since they launched their guerrilla war in the Andean highlands in May 1980. `` <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Morote </PERSON> is considered the No. 2 of the party and its military chief,'' the independent magazine Si said recently. `` For some Shining Path experts, Morote might even be, in practice, the true leader of the organization.'' <PERSON> Abimael </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, a former professor of philosophy, founded the Shining Path movement and is generally recognized as its leader. The Shining Path is seeking to overthrow <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s elected government and install a peasant and worker state patterned after the ideas of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>. Deputy Interior Minister <PERSON> Agustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantilla </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morote </PERSON> was arrested before dawn Sunday at a house in downtown <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> along with two women. Police sources said two other men also were arrested. <PERSON> Mantilla </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morote </PERSON> had fake identification papers but was identified by his fingerprints. Counterinsurgency sources said police raided the house after neighbors told them of suspicious behavior by the people living there. The sources said police discovered revolutionary propaganda, dynamite and a revolver. Col. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Palacios </PERSON>, a top official in the counterinsurgency police, presented Morote to the press Monday but did let him speak. <PERSON> Palacios </PERSON> said police had suspected <PERSON> Morote </PERSON> was in the house. He said <PERSON> Morote </PERSON> put up no resistance. The colonel said <PERSON> Morote </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> a week ago from the northern highlands to coordinate terrorists attacks in the capital. <PERSON> Palacios </PERSON> said the attacks were planned this week to mark the second anniversary of prison riots in which security forces killed more than 250 rebel inmates. There have been reports in recent months of a growing rivalry between <LOCATION> Morote </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Mantilla </PERSON> said he did not discount the possibility that <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON> betrayed <PERSON> Morote </PERSON> to get him out of the way. Morote, known within the rebel band as `` Comrade <PERSON> Remigio </PERSON>,'' is second in importance only to <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> as a splinter group of the <ORGANIZATION> Peruvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Shining Path devoted itself to 10 years of semi-clandestine political work with peasants in the impoverished Andean highlands before taking up arms. <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON> is the ideologist of the organization, but <PERSON> Morote </PERSON> is considered the military strategist of the guerrillas and the advocate of attacks against peasant communities in the highlands that have formed civil defense units on the orders of the military. Counterinsurgency sources said <PERSON> Morote </PERSON>'s capture will create a power vacuum within the central committee of the Shining Path and spark tension until a replacement is found. <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, Morote and other Shining Path leaders went underground in the late 1970s before launching their guerrilla war, which has claimed more than 10,000 lives. <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON> has not been seen for years and rumors have circulated that he may have died. But most counterinsurgency experts believe that <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, described as brilliant by his former professors, is still alive. <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON> has become a mythical figure for Peruvians. Various rumors say that he is living abroad, that he moves about <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> disguised as a priest, that he works as a day laborer in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s crowded street markets Since 1980, the movement has expanded from its base in the highland state of <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> and now launches attacks throughout much of this impoverished nation. Damage to the economy from sabotage is estimated at $ 5 billion.

<HEAD>Presidential Guest Quarters Displayed After $13 Million Makeover</HEAD>

 Officials on Monday showed off the $ 13 million renovation of <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the president's guest quarters where visiting dignitaries can eat in one of three dining rooms, entertain in a cozy library and have their hair styled at a private <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Arden </PERSON> salon. `` It is not too grand, but it has elegance,'' said Chief of Protocol <PERSON> Selwa </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, who oversaw the restoration. `` It is a guest house worthy of this great nation.'' Manager <PERSON> Benedicte </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentiner </PERSON> said she does n't expect guests for another six weeks because work is only 90 percent complete. The chef, for instance, needs to a proper gas range for cooking. The first official visitor has not been named. <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a 115-room complex consisting of four connected townhouses on <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> across from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, was shut down in 1982 after a malfunctioning gas valve leaked explosive natural gas during one dignitary's stay. In 1985, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> allocated $ 8.6 million for a complete overhaul that included new electrical heating, plumbing and air conditioning systems, roof repairs, installation of fire and safety systems and improved security. The rest of the money _ more than $ 5 million _ was raised privately for refurbishing the interior of the four-story house. Furniture is in the Anglo-American style of 18th and 19th centuries with lots of overstuffed chairs and couches, Oriental rugs and hand-painted wallpaper. `` We wanted it to be soft and light,'' said decorator <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, who shared the project with <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Buatta </PERSON>. That was no small feat because heavy curtains will be drawn to keep `` the local <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> terrorist from looking in the windows,'' he said. Rooms that formerly had dingy white walls were painted a variety of bright colors: salmon, blue, shades of yellow, to name a few. Light streams through the back windows that face an interior garden. Chiefs of state invited by the president to use <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will sleep in a double canopy bed in a private room, part of a suite that includes another bedroom for a spouse, a sitting room and three bathrooms, one of which has a European bidet. If the leader feels cramped by an 18th century bed, the Blair House staff can arrange for a king-size bed to be installed. `` We will do anything to make them happy,'' said the multi-lingual <PERSON> Valentiner </PERSON>, who will stay on premises to supervise the staff of 13 during a an official visit. The most number of people <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> can accomodate is 27 _ 19 guests and eight staff members. All stay free of charge. If the leader wants see people, he or she can attend to business in a book-lined libary, which <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> tried to give a masculine feel by using rich brown tones. For news conferences, heads of state have the use of a high-ceilinged room with two fireplaces. Since dignitaries often bring family members, <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has a private <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Arden </PERSON> studio with professional hair styling equipment. The original house, built in 1824, is rich in history. After the original owner's death it was sold to <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, an intimate of President <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Before the outbreak of the Civil War, Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was offered the command of the Union Armies at a <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> meeting, but he declined in favor of his native <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> approved the acquisition of the house in 1942, saying the government needed it `` for the entertainment of distinguished visitors.'' On Nov. 1, 1950, two <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> nationalists tried to force their way into <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in an assassination attempt on President <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>. One of the nationalists and a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> guard died in the shootout.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its forces drove into southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> behind helicopter gunships Monday, recapturing some of the territory east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> that they lost three weeks ago. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it repulsed the invaders. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed Iraqi warplanes dropped chemical bombs on the attackers but said chemical warfare units neutralized the poison gas and kept casualties to a minimum. Revolutionary Guards stormed through mine fields and thickets of barbed wire in a two-pronged offensive before dawn in the <LOCATION> Salamcheh </LOCATION> region, killing or wounding more than 11,500 Iraqis and capturing 2,100, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> acknowledged the Iranians broke through border defenses in a `` reckless assault'' 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, the southern port and provincial capital. The Iraqis said their 3rd <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> `` absorbed the momentum'' and `` completely destroyed'' the offensive in a 19-hour battle which was supervised by President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and resulted in `` a new victory.'' The Iraqi president returned to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> on Monday evening after the fighting settled in the favor of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops, <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> radio reported. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed the Revolutionary Guards, supported by artillery barrages and air strikes, were `` holding the upper hand.'' An Iraqi communique said Iraqi planes flew 170 combat missions and helicopter gunships flew 240. That is the highest single-day tally of Iraqi missions in months. The communique said the aircraft destroyed nearly 200 vehicles and inflicted `` enormous losses.'' No independent confirmation of the conflicting claims was available. Neither side allows Western journalists or other neutral observers into combat zones except on rare guided tours. The Iranian attack was seen as a bid by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new commander-in-chief, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, to regain military initiative lost by defeats in the past two months of the war, which began nearly eight years ago. It was not clear how many Iranian troops were involved in the thrust. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> communiques indicated the assault forces initially engaged at least 11 infantry and armored brigades, an estimated 40,000 men. Since it is standard military practice for an assault force to outnumber defenders at least 2-1, that would indicate about 80,000 Iranians. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified Revolutionary Guards commander at the front as calling the Iranian offensive `` a crushing response to recent Iraqi movements in <LOCATION> Salamcheh </LOCATION>.'' It said air force planes flew 19 ground-attack sorties and that 28 missions by helicopter gunships destroyed `` tens of tanks and armored personnel carriers ... creating a hell of fire for the Iraqi forces.'' The commander claimed anti-aircraft gunners shot down an Iraqi warplane in the region, but did not disclose the type of the jet reportedly downed. According to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s communiques, one of its air strikes was on an Iranian air base near the western city of <LOCATION> Dezful </LOCATION>, apparently to knock out <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> jets supporting the offensive. Reports in official Iranian media in the past two weeks have said thousands of `` basij,'' or volunteers, were going to the front. In its reports of the battle, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian troops broke through <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> defenses and destroyed at least 30 Soviet-made tanks. It said the attackers caused heavy casualties in six infantry brigades and wiped out three artillery battalions that were caught in the open. Dispatches from the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted a military spokesman in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> as reporting an Iranian offensive east of <LOCATION> Fish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, an area northeast of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> flooded several years ago to frustrate Iranian assaults. He said the Iraqis were preparing a counteroffensive `` that will teach the enemy a good lesson.'' According to the Iranians, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers counterattacked at noon but were driven back with the loss of 800 killed or wounded. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> dispatches said the battlefield was littered with knocked-out tanks and armored vehicles of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s 3rd Armored Division and 5th Mechanized Infantry Division. Elements of both divisions were involved in the Iraqi assault May 25 that drove the Iranians out of their hard-won bridgehead east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and back across the frontier. The offensive Monday was the first major Iranian operation since that battle. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> seized the marshlands east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> with huge losses in January and February of 1987 and fought to within 6 miles of the city. Two years ago, Iranian forces captured the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>. On April 18, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> recaptured it in a 34-hour battle that began with a surprise attack.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today the government may be forced to pay damages when a vaccine it licenses causes the disease it was intended to prevent. By a 9-0 vote, the justices rejected <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration arguments that the government always should be shielded from lawsuit in such cases. In another case, the court agreed to judge the constitutionality of a new sentencing system for people convicted of federal crimes. The court reinstated a suit by the parents of a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> boy who contracted polio after receiving a dose of federally approved vaccine. Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, in his opinion for the court, said governmental immunity from suit only extends to instances in which an official exercises discretion or judgment. `` The discretionary function exception, however, does not apply if the acts complained of do not involve the permissible exercise of policy discretion,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. If a federal policy `` leaves no room for an official to excercise policy judgment in performing a given act, or if the act simply does not involve the exercise of such judgment,'' the government may be sued for causing personal injury, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. The court revived a suit in behalf of polio victim <PERSON> Kevan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkovitz </PERSON>, who was less than three months old on May 10, 1979, when his pediatrician in <LOCATION> Charleroi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, gave him a dose of <LOCATION> Orimune </LOCATION>. The drug, manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, is a form of <PERSON> Sabin </PERSON> oral vaccine. <PERSON> Orimune </PERSON> was licensed by the government in 1963. <PERSON> Kevan </PERSON> was stricken with polio within a month and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Communicable Disease Center determined he contracted the disease from the vaccine. He is paralyzed and deformed and breathes with the help of a respirator. The <PERSON> Berokovitz </PERSON> family contends that negligence by a goverment worker caused the child's polio. The parents said the vaccine approved by the government violated its own standards for safety and that policy-making discretion by the government was not involved in approving the defective vaccine. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration argued that even when an employee is negligent, the government agency that employs the worker may be using its discretion in approving the vaccine. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said if the government can be sued in such cases, it will be forced into becoming an insurer of vaccines and may withdraw from licensing them. Federal officials said <PERSON> Sabin </PERSON> oral vaccine, administered routinely to all children in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has all but eliminated polio even though each year a few who take the vaccine have adverse reactions. Today's ruling overturned a decision by the 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Philadelhia </LOCATION> which threw out the <PERSON> Berkovitz </PERSON> suit last year. The appeals court held that discretion was involved when the government initially decided to verify test results by vaccine manufacturers, thereby shielding the government from suit. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, a lawyer representing <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, said the impact of the ruling is unclear. He said the decision appears to cover all government-licensed vaccines and possibly other drugs as well. But he said the standards enunciated by the court may affect a limited number of cases. `` The facts alleged here are unusual and I do n't know whether they -LRB- the <PERSON> Berkovitz </PERSON> family -RRB- can prove them,'' he said. `` These are circumstances that are unlikely to arise'' very often. <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> who said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> licenses more than 40 vaccines, declined to comment on the impact of the ruling. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Viakley </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <PERSON> Berkovitz </PERSON> family, said `` it's not a case of an allergic reaction It's a case where the government knew that this particular polio vaccine violated its own regulatory safety standards. By the government's own regulatory safety standards, this vaccine was unsafe, but it licensed it anyway.'' She said, `` It's not going to affect any cases where there is simply an allergic reaction,'' such as DPT vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, which the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION> says is the source of three-quarters of the serious injuries to children resulting from vaccines. At issue in the sentencing case is whether the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Sentencing Commission's rules that took effect Nov. 1 may stand or must be thrown out. The validity of the commission itself is at stake, also. By the time the court announces its decision, expected sometime in 1989, thousands of defendants will have to be resentenced _ regardless of which way the court rules. In other action, the court: _ Armed police with new authority, ruling that officers sometimes may chase someone who starts running at the sight of them even though they have no reason to suspect criminal conduct. It unanimously ruled that <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> prosecutors may use as evidence the drugs dropped by a man who started running when he spotted a police cruiser on a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> street. _ Declined to study an unprecedented racial-desegregation case and refused to free <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, officials from having to integrate city schools and build subsidized housing to overcome decades of discrimination. The court, without comment, left intact rulings that <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> must bujild subsidized housing in predominantly white sections of the city and create `` magnet'' schools to reduce segregation. _ Agreed to decide whether the government may use a 19h Century anti-fraud law to impose stiff civil fines on top of criminal penalties for the same offense. The court said it will hear an appeal by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials seeking to fine the manager of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> medical laboratory $ 131,170 for defrauding the government of $ 585 on Medicare bills. _ Ruling that the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is similar to a private business, said the service must pay interest on back pay owed to a worker who won a lawsuit charging it with illegal discrimination. By a 5-3 vote, the court ordered interest on back pay for a letter carrier in <LOCATION> Chesterfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, who was fired and later ordered rehired. _ Barred states from banning all direct mail advertisements sent by lawyers to potential clients. The court, by a 6-3 vote, ruled in a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> case that states violate free-speech rights when prohibiting lawyers from soliciting business by sending truthful and non-deceptive letters to people they know face particular legal problems. The vaccine case is <PERSON> Berkovitz </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-498.

 Smiling grade school students Monday helped a descendant of legendary seamstress <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> place a wreath at her tomb on the eve of Flag Day. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norristown </LOCATION> placed the wreath with the assistance of <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Amend </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, both 11 amd from <LOCATION> Cranford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>. About 100 people gathered around Mrs. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>' gravesite in the Atwater Kent Park for the ceremony Amend and <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> were among 62 fifth-graders who attended the ceremony. Mrs. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, according to some historical accounts, created the first official <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag, sewing a flag with bars and 13 five-pointed stars. The story goes that a special committee headed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> visited Mrs. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> in June 1776 and asked her to sew a flag based on their rough design. Mrs. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> was the official flagmaker for the <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. But the story of the first stars and stripes has never been authenticated. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, an administrator at <ORGANIZATION> Bryn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mawr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, plays saxophone in a big band, and says he is not a practicing Quaker; nor does he belong to any organizations such as the Sons of the American Revolution. But he said he admires his great-great-great-grandmother, who died in 1836, because she was a rebel. `` I do this because <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> was a pretty cool old girl,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. `` She was no shrinking violet.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, born <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Griscom </PERSON> to Quaker parents on Jan. 1, 1752, broke with the Quaker tradition of pacifism to support the Revolutionary War, he said. The ceremony Monday was preparatory to the city's Flag Day ceremonies on Tuesday, which commemorates the day <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> officially adopted the flag in 1777.

<HEAD>Aspirin Packages To Carry Stronger Warning on Reye Syndrome</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it has published a final regulation requiring a permanent and stronger warning label against giving aspirin to children and teen-agers with chicken pox or flu because of the danger of Reye syndrome. The new warning, a modification of one already required on aspirin and aspirin-containing drugs, says: `` WARNING: Children and teen-agers should not use this medicine for chicken pox or flu symptoms before a doctor is consulted about <PERSON> Reye </PERSON> syndrome, a rare but serious illness reported to be associated with aspirin.'' The new part of the warning is the last phrase: `` reported to be associated with aspirin.'' The stronger warning is based on a <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> study that found a significant association between Reye syndrome and taking aspirin during chicken pox or flu, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. For one year, aspirin and aspirin products must display an attention-getting device, such as a flag on the label, alerting consumers to the new and stronger Reye syndrome warning. The new warning and attention-getting statement will be required on aspirin products sold after Dec. 9, 1988. Until then, the current warnings may be used. Although rare, <PERSON> Reye </PERSON> syndrome is fatal in 20 percent to 30 percent of cases, and some survivors suffer permanent brain damage. Its symptoms _ severe tiredness, belligerence and excessive vomiting _ may occur just as a child or teen-ager appears to be recovering from flu or chicken pox.

<HEAD>Pet Skunk Put To Sleep For Biting Neighbor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The pet skunk who made headlines and drew hundreds of callers lobbying to save his life was put to death Monday because the man he bit refused to undergo precautionary rabies treatment. After three stays of execution, <PERSON> Skunky </PERSON> was given a fatal injection so that his brain could be tested to see whether he had rabies. Skunky's owner, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Buford </PERSON>, had tried until the end to save the animal by trying to persuade the man whom Skunky bit either to take rabies shots or drop his complaint. She had tears in her eyes as she spoke her last words to her pet. `` Hey, you're sleeping. You're not conscious. It's fine,'' she said. The bitten man, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 48, had said Thursday he would not change his mind and either drop his complaint or undergo a $ 600 series of rabies shots. Both moves would have spared Skunky's life. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' physician said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> should avoid rabies shots because he suffered a heart attack two weeks ago. Ms. <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> claims that <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> was mistreating her 1-year-old skunk when he was bitten June 4, but <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said he was bitten when he reached down to pet the animal, thinking it was a cat. Officials say that the skunk is not classified as a domestic animal, and by state law, had to be put to death and its brain tested for rabies. The only alternatives were for <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> to volunteer to undergo rabies treatment or to take a chance and agree to spare Skunky from the fatal test. County Public Information Officer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirt </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Skunky </PERSON> had won three stays of execution last week, when the story began making headlines. <PERSON> Skunky </PERSON> won his first postponement so that his case could be heard by the county commission last week. The commission gave him another break until Thursday, and then agreed to an extension until Monday at noon. `` I've had hundreds of calls to the county office to save Skunky,'' said <PERSON> Hirt </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Irish Judge Rejects British Bid To Extradite Suspect Bomber</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s first attempt to extradite a guerrilla suspect under a new agreement with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> collapsed on Monday when an Irish court freed a man accused of bombings in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was `` utterly dismayed'' by the ruling, a senior aide said. A crowd of supporters cheered <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McVeigh </PERSON>, 37, outside <LOCATION> Portlaoise </LOCATION> district court and drove him away so quickly they left his wife, <PERSON> Celina </PERSON>, standing on the sidewalk. <PERSON> McVeigh </PERSON> was the first person targeted for extradition since the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> governments last month resolved legal differences which had stopped all extraditions this year. An Irish state application was made for <PERSON> McVeigh </PERSON> to be sent to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to face charges regarding explosions between 1981 and 1983 that killed two people outside <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION> and a bomb disposal expert in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>. Judge <PERSON> Jarlath </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruane </PERSON> said the Irish government had not properly established <PERSON> McVeigh </PERSON>'s identity. The judge said British police had not sent witnesses to identify <PERSON> McVeigh </PERSON> as the man wanted, so there was nothing to indicate the man in court was the same as the one mentioned on extradition warrants. <PERSON> McVeigh </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, was arrested May 18 as he left <LOCATION> Portlaoise </LOCATION> prison after serving five years of a seven-year term for <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> weapons offenses. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s director of public prosecutions, said in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> authorities had assured his officers further identification was not needed. An <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> government spokesman said: `` We do not comment on decisions made in court.'' <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> McManus </PERSON>, national chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the legal political wing of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, accused the British government of arrogance in assuming <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> courts automatically would hand over prisoners. `` There should be no extradition of Irish citizens to face British injustice,'' <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. Under a new law that took effect last Dec. 1, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> agreed to make positive identification the chief factor in extradition. Previously, Irish courts freed wanted guerrillas on grounds the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> was engaged in a political struggle and not a criminal one in trying to drive the British out of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The extradition issue has been a major British-Irish dispute. In 1986, bombing suspect <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenholmes </PERSON> was freed when a <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> court found a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> police warrant for her defective. She has been on the run from valid warrants ever since. <LOCATION> London-Dublin </LOCATION> relations are still troubled by the fatal shootings on March 6 of three guerrilla suspects in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> colony and refusal to grant a new trial for six <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> people imprisoned in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for bombings of which they say they are innocent.

<HEAD>Daimler-Benz Says Payment To ``Soothe'' Nazi Horrors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STUTTGART, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The industrial giant <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, which forced people to work for the Nazi war effort, said Monday that its $ 11.7 million payment to victims is designed to help prevent similar injustices. `` We hope to make a contribution toward preventing the horrors of the past from being repeated,'' <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> board chairman <PERSON> Edzard </PERSON> <PERSON> Reuter </PERSON> told reporters at the company's headquarters in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>. `` With this gesture, we hope to soothe the still painful scars -LRB- of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> regime -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Reuter </PERSON>, whose family fled to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> takeover. <ORGANIZATION> Reuter </ORGANIZATION>'s father was a promiment Social Democrat, one of the major foes of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. Like other German companies during <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Third Reich, <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> used thousands of forced laborers to fuel its wartime production of engines and vehicles for the military. Many laborers died from ill-treatment or were later murdered in Nazi concentration camps. The German <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> announced <ORGANIZATION> Daimler </ORGANIZATION>'s payments Friday. The announcement followed a study the company commissioned to determine the extent to which forced laborers worked in its plants nearly a half century ago. <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> makes buses and cars, including <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> luxury automobiles. Its many subsidiaries include a major aerospace manufacturer. According to a study released in 1987 by an indepndent historical research group, more than 46,000 forced laborers were being used in <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> factories in 1944. The study, compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Hamburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for 20th Century Social History, concluded that by the end of the war, half of the workers at the company's factories were forced laborers. The study detailed brutal work conditions and executions of workers _ many from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ accused of sabotage. It also concluded that <ORGANIZATION> Daimler </ORGANIZATION> management conspired with Nazi leaders in the early 1930s to make the company <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s chief producer of military vehicles. The amount of the <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> payment and its timing drew immediate fire from survivors of the labor programs. `` The real tragedy is that 43 years after the end of the war, only a quarter of those who worked at <ORGANIZATION> Daimler </ORGANIZATION> are still alive,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hausser </PERSON>, a spokesman for a Stuttgart-based group representing the interests of the former laborers. `` One ca n't even begin to call this compensaton,'' <PERSON> Hausser </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> joins other major German companies that have paid reparations to former forced laborers and their families. Government studies indicate that more than 8 million people worked against their will in factories during World War II. Among them were people deported from occupied territories, prisoners of war and concentration camp inmates. In 1986, the giant Flick conglomerate paid $ 2.9 million to its victims. Other West German firms, such as the giant <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION> concern, a major weapons producer during World War II, have also paid reparations. In addition to the company payments, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government has so far paid $ 46.8 billion to <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> concentration camp survivors, under the 1952 <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> agreement signed between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. That figure is expected to reach $ 58.5 billion by the end of the century.

 Manufacturing corporations' after-tax profits averaged 6.3 cents per dollar of sales in the first three months of the year, up a sharp 43 percent from the fourth quarter, the government reported Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers' after-tax profits totaled a seasonally adjusted $ 39.4 billion in the first quarter, compared with $ 27.4 billion in the fourth quarter, when profits averaged 4.4 cents per dollar of sales. After-tax profits totaled $ 36.9 billion, a 41.3 percent rise from the fourth-quarter total of $ 26.1 billion in profits. Sales climbed a smaller 2.1 percent in the first quarter to $ 629.1 billion from $ 616.2 billion in the fourth quarter. The combination of rising profits and higher sales boosted the level of profits to 6.3 cents per dollar of sales, an increase of 43 percent over the fourth - quarter performance of 4.4 cents The government said the profit improvement occurred in part because petroleum and chemical companies took large write-offs against profits in the fourth quarter, depressing earnings during that period. Manufacturers of primary metals, electrical machinery and transportation equipment all enjoyed profit gains of more than 30 percent in the first quarter from the final quarter of 1987. Compared with a year earlier, companies reporting profit increases of 50 percent or more were food, paper, printing, petroleum, primary metals, fabricated metals, machinery and instruments.

<TEXT>
 A general strike was said to have virtually shut down <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> on Monday, and a shotgun blast killed a policeman during weekend ethnic protests in the neighboring southern republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said an Azerbaijani officer was killed by shotgun fire during protests in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> capital. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> identified the slain officer only as Sgt. <PERSON> Izmailov </PERSON>. It was the first official confirmation of a police death in ethnic unrest that began in February in the neighboring <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republics. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> identified the gunman only as an Armenian named <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON>. Azerbaijanis and Armenians are arguing over control of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a region with a predominantly Armenian population that was assigned to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in 1923. The conflict is aggravated by the fact that most Azerbaijanis are Moslems and most Armenians are Christians. On Sunday, rumors that two Armenians had been killed in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> led to protests by Armenians in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. They gathered in a cemetery and marched to the offices of the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told reporters Monday: `` We have received information from <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> that the information about the murder of two Armenians is false. In fact, there was a shooting in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> from a shotgun _ a shot from a shotgun and the bullet killed a militia sergeant there.'' `` The bullet was deflected from some kind of surface,'' he said, and police have not determined whether the killing was intentional or accidental. It occurred `` during a demonstration for retaining <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. He provided no details of the shooting and did not say precisely when it occurred. There were unconfirmed reports Saturday of large-scale protests in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dissident reached by telephone, said Armenians met in their capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, on Sunday and decided on a general strike. Its timing is an attempt to influence a June 15 meeting of the Supreme Soviet of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> Suren </PERSON> <PERSON> Arutyunyan </PERSON>, addressed protesters and told them the Armenian Supreme Soviet would `` not only review, but decide positively'' on their claim, <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said. National government and party officials have refused the Armenian demand for control of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, a former political prisoner, said the activists had not decided how long the strike would run but that it might continue until June 28, when a special conference of the national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> begins in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He said estimates of the number of people who gathered in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> on Sunday ranged from 500,000 to 700,000, which would rival the huge demonstrations at the end of February. His estimate could not be confirmed independently. After the February protests, riots broke out in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>. Officials have said 32 people were killed _ 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis. Those who protested on Sunday agreed on a general strike to include all industries except food processing, health care and transportation, <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said, and it spread to public transport on Monday. He said strikes were under way throughout <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, with the possible exception of <LOCATION> Kafan </LOCATION> city, from which he had no information. According to official and dissident versions of events in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, strikes, meetings and protests continued from Sunday night into Monday morning. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said the constant gatherings in the main square were called off Monday afternoon because the temperature reached 104 degrees. People assembled again Monday night but there was no information on their numbers or what happened, he said. <PERSON> Arutyunyan </PERSON> was made Armenian party leader May 21, replacing <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Demirchyan </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> party leader <PERSON> Kyamran </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagirov </PERSON> was replaced the same day in a clear indication of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s displeasure with the unrest. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the trouble did not stem from <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to reform Soviet society. `` This is not the result of democracy and glasnost, but many years of stagnation when we did n't delve deeply enough into national problems,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The Guardian Angels on Monday accused police of harassing them to halt their patrol of a restaurant district, saying police arrested two Angels after they were menaced by a knife-wielding crack dealer. `` I think it's ridiculous for the police to be fighting the Guardian Angels. They should be fighting the crack dealers,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the group and wife of the group's founder, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> `` It's almost as if they are on the side of the drug dealers.'' The confrontation that led to the arrest of two youths Sunday night followed an incident the previous night that left one Angel critically injured after he was stabbed. The Angels started their patrols of the Restaurant Row section of West 46th Street in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> last Wednesday. Fifteen proprietors asked the volunteer patrol group to help rid the block of drug traffic. Asked if the Angels were being harassed by police, Detective <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McConville </PERSON>, a department spokesman, said: `` I have no knowledge of that.'' He had no comment when asked if the <PERSON> Angels </PERSON> were being asked not to patrol Restaurant Row. According to Ms. <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON>, the latest incident occurred at about 1 a.m. Monday while the two Angels were on patrol in the area. `` They told a small group of crack dealers to leave the area, to move on. One of the crack dealers pulled out a knife from his back pocket and threatened the <PERSON> Angels </PERSON>,'' she said. The Angels immediately called police, who took everyone to the <LOCATION> Midtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> precinct station, she said. <PERSON> McConville </PERSON>, however, said the incident occurred about 9:20 p.m. Sunday. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, told police he was surrounded by 12 Angels and refused to leave the area when they ordered him out. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> McConville </PERSON>, was bumped by an <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> and then `` took out a pocket knife and held it at his side for protection.'' When police arrived, they arrested <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and two <PERSON> Angels </PERSON>, <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The three were charged with menacing and the <PERSON> Angels </PERSON> also were charged with harassing. In Saturday's incident, <PERSON> Illya </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtenberg </PERSON>, 16, of <LOCATION> Verona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was hit in the head with a bottle and stabbed in the chest during a confrontation between about 15 Angels and 15 other people, police said. <PERSON> Lichtenberg </PERSON> was in critical condition Monday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincent </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> after surgery A 25-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder in the incident.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 jet crossed the ice-clogged <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> on Monday in a short but historic flight aimed at bridging 40 years of wariness and distrust between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The one-time charter `` friendship flight'' to the eastern <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION> from the western <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> was seen as a tentative first step in thawing relations and reuniting Eskimo families split when the Iron Curtain slammed shut during the Cold War in 1948. The border between <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was closed first by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and then by the Soviets. Monday's 40-minute flight was approved by the Soviets with little notice earlier this month after two years of work by Alaskans promoting the idea. Eighty government officials, <PERSON> Eskimos </PERSON> and journalists were booked aboard the jet making the 225-mile flight. It left <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> shortly after 3 p.m. EDT. <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION> officials planned to entertain the visitors with tours, a banquet and a trip to an outlying native village. The flight is part of a broader effort being mounted by <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> business leaders, educators, and state officials to improve the state's relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 The White House on Monday shrugged off a new book that says former presidential aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> proposed using hostage negotiator <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> in an attempt to set up <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> for assassination. `` We do n't look into <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> stories,'' said presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` That's history, and world leaders know it. It's a book about <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. What do we care?'' He called the book's narration about the alleged North episode a `` cockamamie story.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said events involving <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a former staff member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, were `` a long time ago. I do n't know what he did.'' North was fired in November, 1986, after the discovery of an alleged diversion of profits from the secret <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. North and three other defendants face trial felony conspiracy charges.

<TEXT>
 Pioneer 10, the little spacecraft that wo n't quit, is still searching for a 10th planet five years after leaving the known solar system and 16 years after leaving the launch pad, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> scientists said Monday. Disturbances in the orbits of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and Uranus suggest that a mysterious Planet X may be orbiting beyond <LOCATION> Pluto </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propulsion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> said as <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> observed the fifth anniversary of Pioneer 10's dash past <LOCATION> Pluto </LOCATION>'s orbit. Pioneer 10, launched in 1972 and now over 4 billion miles from home even though it was guaranteed for only 21 months, also is searching for long gravity waves proposed by <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>, and the boundary of the sun's influence. The radio signals the 570-pound space probe is sending back _ from 45 times the distance between the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and the sun _ are n't very powerful and take six hours to get here at the speed of light But they are important to researchers trying to solve some classical puzzles about the universe. The energy of the craft's signals picked up by a 70-meter deep space antenna would have to be accumulated for over 11 billion years to build up enough energy to light a 7 -LCB- - watt nightlight for one millisecond, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fimmel </PERSON>, project manager at the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> But the signals from <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> 10 and its twin, <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> 11, launched in 1973, are strong enough to send `` high quality data on a daily basis,'' said physicist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION>, a principal investigator on the Pioneer project. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who discovered the radiation belts surrounding <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, said Pioneer 10 has literally and figuratively gone far beyond its original missions to study Jupiter and the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. `` One of the principal current objectives is the observation of cosmic rays and the flow of the solar wind at heretofore unexplored distances from the sun,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` We now have a realistic expectation of finding the outer boundary of the heliosphere, which is the sphere of influence of the sun, and of penetrating into the nearby interstellar media,'' he said. But sadly, he said, Pioneer 10 may stop working before it reaches the edge of the heliosphere. The tiny craft is expected to operate only another seven to 10 years, <PERSON> Fimmel </PERSON> said, and may run out of energy before it reaches interstellar space. Before that, however, Pioneer 10 may give scientists clues to the shape of the heliosphere. And it is relaying strong evidence suggesting Planet X or possibly two smaller unknown planets exist. `` We have a 90 to 99 percent confidence that Uranus and <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> are being disturbed, and one candidate for that is a single Planet X,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` It's conceivable there could be other gravitational effects on the two orbits. `` We have n't ruled out other matter which could be in orbit around the sun,'' he said. `` It could be small particulate matter. It could be more than one planet that are very small. The best hypothesis is a single planet X at one to four Earth masses.'' Such a planet, he said, would likely be a mixture of ice and rock. Pioneer 10 made its closest approach to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION> _ 82,000 miles _ on Dec. 3, 1973, 21 months after it was launched, after traveling an arc-shaped 620 million-mile path from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. It was the first spacecraft to cross the Asteroid Belt, fly past <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> and return pictures, chart <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s intense radiation belts, measure the mass of its four planet-sized moons, and discover that <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> is predominantly a liquid planet. Pioneer 11 encountered Jupiter a year later, then reached <LOCATION> Saturn </LOCATION> on Sept. 1, 1979. Both craft, though partly damaged along the way, far exceeded their operations guarantee of at least 21 months. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Redondo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> joked Monday that the company would fix anything wrong with the two Pioneers if <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> could bring them back.

 Tragedies like the death of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> recruit during a training program could be avoided if the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> did a better job of screening recruits for potential mental health problems, Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilirakis </PERSON> said Monday. `` We need to find out what steps are being taken by the military to deal with this very serious problem of phobias,'' the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Democrat told a news conference. On Monday he wrote to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> seeking detailed information about how the Pentagon screens recruits for potential mental health problems. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s office said the secretary would not have any comment because the letter had n't yet been received. <PERSON> Bilirakis </PERSON>' letter referred to the March 2 death of Airman Recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, who drowned during an elite rescue swimmer training program at the <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, Naval Air Station. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigator is now deliberating whether five swimming instructors and a commanding officer should be court-martialed because force was used to stop <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> from leaving the pool where he drowned. Testimony at a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> preliminary hearing indicated <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> had a phobia about being pulled under water. <PERSON> Bilirakis </PERSON> held his news conference along with members of the <ORGANIZATION> Phobic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, who said <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s case highlights the dangers of phobias. Phobias are defined as persistent, irrational fears of a specific object, activity or situation which results in a compelling desire by an individual to avoid the fearful stimulus. <PERSON> Bilirikis </PERSON>, citing statistics from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said `` phobias are the number one mental disorder in this nation and one out of every eight people suffer from some sort of phobia.'' According to <PERSON> Bilirakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death may have been avoided had his phobia been recognized before he entered the training program. <PERSON> Bilirakis </PERSON> said nothing on the military medical forms filled out by recruits addresses phobias. `` Additionally, I am told there is nothing in the military medical procedures requiring a doctor to ask about specific mental health disorders at all.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> researchers are growing coca plants in a $ 1 million-a-year search for ways to eradicate South American crops destined for processing into cocaine, officials said Monday. Between 400 and 600 plants are being grown at two <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> research sites, one a greenhouse near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the other an outdoor location in an undisclosed, warm-weather area, said Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knipling </PERSON>, associate deputy administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s national program staff. <PERSON> Knipling </PERSON> said all of the plants used in the experiment are incinerated afterward and that no cocaine is produced from them. Researchers earlier had grown opium poppies in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and marijuana in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as part of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s research into ways to stem production of narcotics. The priority changed two years ago because of growing use by Americans of cocaine and crack, a cocaine derivative, <PERSON> Knipling </PERSON> said. The project was spotlighted in a report published in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. <PERSON> Knipling </PERSON> estimated the cost of the program at about $ 1 million a year. He said part of the funds come from the research service's regular budget and the rest by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` There is absolutely none being developed into cocaine,'' <PERSON> Knipling </PERSON> said. `` ... It's not possible, not at our agricultural facilities.'' He confirmed that the seeds were brought to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and said a number of herbicides have been tested for use against the plant. The chief herbicide recommended to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for use against coca is tebutherion, a product manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> under the trade name <PERSON> Spike </PERSON>. <PERSON> Knipling </PERSON> said it is used in considerable quantities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to clear brush in areas where food crops do not grow. Guards, alarms and wire fences are being used to keep out intruders at the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> installations, <PERSON> Knipling </PERSON> said. He refused to disclose the precise whereabouts of either of the growing sites. The issue first surfaced when the former head of the project, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentner </PERSON>, said in interviews that he had resigned in April to protest what he described as the failure of the Agriculture and State departments to examine adequately the potential dangers from use of the herbicide. <PERSON> Knipling </PERSON> said there had been considerable pressure from various places in the administration to get on with approval of <PERSON> Spike </PERSON> for use against coca. `` We've been under an extensive sense of urgency coming from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and, of course, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, itself, that this is a high-priority project,'' he said. <PERSON> Knipling </PERSON> said there had been `` frequent calls and visits'' to the research service that intensified the pressure. He also said it was intensified by demands from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the public for action to combat drugs. <PERSON> Knipling </PERSON> contended that illicit cocaine production in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is doing far more to endanger the environment than would use of tebutherion. He said there was little doubt that the coca leaves were being heavily sprayed with pesticides, which could cause harm. Moreover, he said, sulfuric acid and other chemicals being used to process the coca into cocaine are undoubtedly dumped into streams when the manufacturing process is over.

<TEXT>
 Senators scurried Monday to overcome last-minute objections by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to a far-reaching welfare bill designed to help people break out of poverty through jobs, training and education. Following a round of opening statements on the Family Security Act, key senators retired to the office of Sen. Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., to try to work out differences with the administration, which was threatening to veto the measure The bill's chief sponsor, Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the first session was `` very promising'' and that the meetings would continue through the evening and on Tuesday. `` We have been attempting to find some solutions and we clearly are making progress, at least in some very specific regards,'' <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said past congressional moves have only made the welfare system worse. `` What we do here in the next few days in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will be a step in the right direction, for once,'' he said. The five-year, $ 2.6 billion bill is consensus measure that took 18 months to develop. It is a compromise version of a $ 7 billion welfare plan passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last Dec. 17. Besides putting more welfare recipients to work, the bill would force more absentee parents to pay child support and require states to provide at least six months of welfare benefits to poor households with two parents. Government checks are the main feature of the current Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, serving 3.7 million families, including 7 million children, though there is a small-scale work program. The <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> bill and the more expensive <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill attempt to turn welfare into a jobs system, with goverment checks a last resort if wages and child support payments are inadequate. `` Never has the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> considered so fundamental a redirection of the -LRB- welfare -RRB- system,'' <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said. `` It's tempting to say this is an historical moment ... and yet events will decide whether that was the case,'' he said, referring to uncertainty over whether President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would veto the bill. The administration was seeking, among other things, broader authority for states to use federal money for experimental welfare schemes; a mandatory percentage of people participating in work, training or education programs; and a brand-new mandatory workfare or public works program that one senator said would cost $ 900 million. The Office of Management and <PERSON> Budget </PERSON> said in a statement Monday that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would veto the bill in its present form. Many senators said the <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> measure is sorely needed to update and improve a 53-year-old program conceived as a temporary benefit for widows in an age when divorced, working and unmarried mothers were a rarity. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called welfare reform `` an urgent national priority.'' He said the nation is making do with `` a <PERSON> Rube </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> welfare system developed during the Depression to meet the needs of a society that no longer exists.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and others hammered at <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>'s themes that children are the poorest population group in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today and that their training for the job market is important given projections of an impending labor shortage. `` Millions of children who are living in poverty and receiving welfare today must become the trained, motivated workers of tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. States would have to require parents to furnish Social Security numbers at the birth of their children; meet minimum standards for establishing paternity; set guidelines for child support awards; and set procedures for immediate wage withholding from paychecks. All states would be required to have a jobs, education and training program for welfare recipients with children age 3 or over, or age 1 at state option. States would have to guarantee child care for participants, and spend half their money on people who are or are likely to be long-term welfare recipients. Nine months of transitional child care assistance and a year of Medicaid coverage would be required for people moving off welfare into the workforce. Another provision would require states to give welfare benefits to families with two parents in the home. Twenty-six states already provide such benefits; <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>'s compromise would make six months a year mandatory in the other 24 states. The <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> bill would be financed primarily by making permanent the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s refund withholding program for delinquent federal debtors and phasing out the dependent care tax credit for higher-income taxpayers. The House bill offers states financial incentives to raise their benefit levels, many of which are far below the federal poverty line. Liberal lawmakers and interest groups have criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill for leaving out the provision.

I said ` He's out there.'' `` Surfing was his whole life,'' said <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Granis </PERSON>, pioneer surfing photographer who grew up with <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON> when surf boards were 110 pounds of pine and redwood. <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON> started the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surfing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1960s. `` There is now an immense hole in amateur surfing on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> because he was really the crankshaft of organized surfing on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>,'' said Surfer magazine publisher <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Pezman </PERSON>. `` The sport will miss him. `` Surfing is really the antithesis of organized social behavior so it was hard to organize. But it had to organize to survive. Hoppy was always the guy willing to do the dirty work. `` He dedicated his life to making surf competitions a place where young people could become exposed to sportsmanship and all the virtues of wave riding.'' In addition to surfing, <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON> had a master's degree in electrical engineering from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, and worked on space radar systems at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> before retiring at age 55. <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>, who recently moved to <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, is survived by a brother, two sisters, two daughters, a son and eight grandchildren.

 <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> refused Monday to recommend a halt to the scheduled Tuesday morning execution of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, convicted of romancing, robbing and murdering a service station worker in August 1984. The decision left <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s fate up to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Other state and federal courts refused earlier Monday to stop the execution, which would be the 100th in the nation since capital punishment was reinstituted more than 10 years ago. At Monday's <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> hearing, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was described by defense attorneys <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Potterfield </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumgartner </PERSON> as a sensitive, articulate jailhouse poet who helped other inmates write letters to loved ones. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, clad in blue jeans and T-shirt, claimed he never intended to kill his victim. `` I was planning to rob this woman all along,'' said the curly haired, 28-year-old prisoner. `` It was all set up. There were no flaws that I could see.'' Four of the five pardon board members who heard <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s case voted against a lighter sentence. A fifth member was absent. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was to die in the electric chair at the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> for fatally bludgeoning <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bossier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The Pardon Board has no power to stop executions, but can recommend sentence reductions for approval by Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>. Ever since his arrest, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> has admitted that he started dating <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> because he knew she handled large sums of money at the service station where she worked. But he insisted he never meant to kill her. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> died after being struck repeatedly with a ball peen hammer. `` I just attempted to knock her unconscious,'' <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in a hearing that began about 14 hours before his scheduled execution. `` It did n't work.'' As <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to recommend reducing his sentence to life imprisonment, efforts to save him continued at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Early Monday, the 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> and the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected appeals. At the <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> hearing, which took place at the prison, defense lawyers had <PERSON> Yousef </PERSON> <PERSON> Danesh </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor of political science, read poetry written by <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>. <PERSON> Danesh </PERSON> said he had become friends with <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> after the killer was incarcerated at the state prison. <PERSON> Baumgartner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was a young man deeply remorseful about the death he had unintentionally caused. But <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the district attorney who prosecuted the case, painted <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> as a manipulative rogue and cold, calculating killer. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> had been caught in a <LOCATION> Leesville </LOCATION> hotel room the morning after the killing. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was captured, naked, with a barmaid he had picked up at a nearby tavern and had proposed marriage to. Parked outside was a car <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> had stolen from the woman he lived with before getting involved with <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the prosecutor said. The district attorney said the victim has been hit 13 to 15 times with the hammer `` with most of the blows enough to kill her.''

 A Japanese student charged with trying to sneak weapons aboard a jetliner remained jailed Monday without bail. `` He is a threat to the community and a risk of flight,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON> told federal Magistrate <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>. Powers denied bail and scheduled a hearing Thursday on a government motion to hold <PERSON> Yoshino </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosugi </PERSON>, 18, a <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> engineering student, for trial. <PERSON> Kosugi </PERSON>, en route to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to spend the summer with his family, was arrested Sunday morning minutes before the scheduled takeoff of a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner for <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. He had a round-trip ticket and was scheduled to return in September when classes resume. A routine check of his luggage uncovered four practice grenades with live primers, blank rifle ammunition, a small bottle of flash gunpowder, smokeless powder, a carbon dioxide pellet gun with cartridges and pellets, 50 feet of detonation cord, homemade firecrackers, road flares and three knives. The discovery led authorities to close one of five terminals at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> for three hours while the bomb squad examined the explosives. The government charged that <PERSON> Kosugi </PERSON> `` did willfully and without regard for the safety of human life'' try to place the seized items aboard an aircraft. If convicted, he faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $ 25,000 fine. An affidavit filed with the court said <PERSON> Kosugi </PERSON> `` freely admitted that the items located in his luggage belonged to him and were packed in his luggage in a concealed manner by him for transport to his destination, <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kundts </PERSON>, who participated in the questioning, said <PERSON> Kosugi </PERSON> maintained that he collected military paraphernalia. His items were all obtainable from an Army surplus store. The prosecution at the hearing did not say whether the government had any evidence, or even believed, that <PERSON> Kosugi </PERSON> was a member of a terrorist group. But shortly after the arrest, <PERSON> Kundts </PERSON> said foreign authorities had found no connection between <PERSON> Kosugi </PERSON> and terrorist organizations. In April, another Japanese, <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumara </PERSON>, accused of links to the terrorist Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, was arrested at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION> rest stop, where explosives were found in his car.

 Investigators examined an <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner Monday and interviewed crew members to learn why it veered from a runway and skidded to a stop in mud after landing at <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Four people were slightly injured Sunday night aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727-200, which remained overnight in the grassy strip between the airport's parallel runways. The 75 passengers and seven crew members aboard Flight 187 from <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, used emergency chutes to evacuate as a precaution, airport officials said. `` It was a fairly normal flight until we landed,'' said passenger <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, 52, from nearby <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION>. `` I saw the white line and we kept going over it. And then I saw smoke or dust or something. It was very scary.'' `` It seemed to me like about 30 seconds from the time we stopped to the time the stewardess threw the door open and yelled to evacuate,'' she said. Once out of the plane, `` We ran as fast as we could to the runway we had just been on,'' said passenger <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Tune </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` We all congregated and the emergency crews gathered.'' The jet was towed Monday morning to an airport hangar where the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> began its probe of the accident. A representative of Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> was assisting, the jet manufacturer said. `` Upon examination of the airplane after it came to rest in the grassy area, the left tire of the two-tire front nose assembly gear was flat,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Marriott </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` Whether it was flat before they landed, flat on impact or flat after that is still being looked into,'' he said. Port of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliadis </PERSON> said the nose of the plane stopped about 400 feet from the runway, and investigators were checking to see whether the plane might have blown a tire upon landing or possibly struck some debris on the runway. <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gause </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> staff assistant in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said the plane's nose wheel had to be dug out of mud before the plane could be moved There was no other visible damage to the plane, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Gause </PERSON> said it may take months to determine the cause of the accident. <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON>, airport spokeswoman, said two passenger complained of back pain were treated at area hospitals. A third person had a bruised knee and a fourth suffered a sprained ankle, Ms. <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> said. The flight originated in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> and made stops in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> said the airline canceled four flights Monday between <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and various <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> airports because the plane was taken out of service, but expected to operate those flights on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
 A superpowerful American missile cruiser returned to patrol duty in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> Monday after being pulled off for what a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said was maintenance. The 9,400-ton USS Vincennes was taken off duty less than two weeks after its arrival in the waterway May 28. It is the first of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s billion-dollar Aegis-type cruisers to be assigned to the gulf. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers say the warship's multiple-mission, computer-linked radar and weapons system vastly expands the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s air and sea surveillance capabilities The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Goforth </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was withdrawn for `` maintenance upkeep,'' but refused for security reasons to say what was the exact nature of the problem. The ship was out of action for about three days, other <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sources said. Those sources, who spoke on condition of not being identified, said the ship's `` phased-array'' radar system was involved, but could give no other details, and this could not be verified. Unlike standard radar, the system is able to constantly monitor scores of contacts simultaneously. In its first week in the gulf, the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> had a near encounter with an Iranian frigate that intercepted, boarded and then escorted away the Cypriot-flag freighter <LOCATION> Vevey </LOCATION>, suspected of carrying war-related cargo. The cruiser followed the detained ship to the edge of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s declared `` war-exclusion zone'' in hopes of detecting some signal from the <LOCATION> Vevey </LOCATION> that would justify its intervention, but neither saw nor heard any, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers said Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> said an American-owned supertanker, attacked by Iranian gunboats Saturday, would continue to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> as planned after repairs at a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> shipyard. The 258,979-ton <ORGANIZATION> Esso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Demetia </ORGANIZATION>, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and sailing under the British flag, had eight holes in its hull from rocket-propelled grenades, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> said. Fires broke out but were controlled, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> said. There were no casualties. The London-based maritime agency, which monitors commercial shipping worldwide, said the ship now is anchored off <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and will sail to Fujairah, on the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, for repairs. Later it will head for <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, its original destination, with its cargo of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> crude. The raid took place about 45 miles off <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, in an area where no such attacks are rare, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials and gulf-based shipping executives. All these sources spoke on condition of anonymity. Of interest to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> intelligence was how the two or three armed speedboats could appear in daylight and just as quickly vanish in the western gulf, about 60 miles off <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the same distance from Iranian-held <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The island is known as an operating base for the speedboat-borne Revolutionary Guards in the northern gulf. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces maintain a careful watch on shipping activity in the gulf, including small - and medium-sized craft that might be used for minelaying or as `` mother ships'' for the speedboats In land and air action in the nearly 8-year-old war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its forces drove into southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> behind helicopter gunships on Monday, recapturing some of the territory east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> they lost three weeks ago. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it repulsed the invaders. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed Iraqi planes dropped chemical bombs on the attackers but said chemical warfare units neutralized the poison gas and kept casualties to a minimum.

 The 1 million or more Americans infected with the AIDS virus are becoming more infectious, and the risk to uninfected people is growing, researchers said Monday. `` Non-monogamous sexual contact is becoming more dangerous,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goedert </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. He presented his findings at the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>. In a study of hemophiliacs, <PERSON> Goedert </PERSON> found that condoms do n't protect against AIDS unless they are always used during sexual relations `` Irregular condom use is no better than no condom at all,'' he said. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> reported that new AIDS cases are reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the rate of one every 14 minutes. He estimated 365,000 cases will have been reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by 1992 but said the figure could range between 205,000 and 440,000. The AIDS conference here is the largest meeting ever held on the subject of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, with more than 7,000 participants. Also Monday: _ <PERSON> Jean-Baptiste </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunet </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Claude </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said the number of AIDS cases reported in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has reached 12,221 and is doubling every 11 months The incidence of AIDS in drug abusers is exploding in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, he said. In 1985, 7 percent of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s AIDS cases were in drug abusers. Now the figure is 30 percent. An estimated 300,000 to 800,000 people in 30 European countries are infected with the AIDS virus, <PERSON> Brunet </PERSON> said. _ Australian researchers described six cases in which mothers who became infected after birth passed the virus to their infants through breast milk _ An early report from an expanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government study of American hospital patients said that three in every 1,000 patients tested at six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospitals are infected with the AIDS virus _ but the spread of the AIDS virus appears to be slowing <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> said it is difficult to tell if the AIDS epidemic is beginning to level off but said he did n't consider that an important question. `` We had a thousand cases reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week,'' he said in an interview. `` Does it matter whether it's going up or not It might level off like lung cancer or heart disease _ and that's not good.'' A 1986 estimate that 1 million to 1 -LCB- million Americans were infected with the AIDS virus was probably too high then, <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> said. `` We believe an estimate of 1 million to 1 -LCB- million infected is accurate now,'' he said. <PERSON> Goedert </PERSON>'s conclusions about the growing infectiousness of people carrying the AIDS virus came from a study of the rate at which infected hemophiliacs transmitted the AIDS virus to their wives or steady female partners. In the first year of the hemophiliacs' infection, only 1 percent of the partners became infected. By the fourth year, the rate of transmission began to increase and by the fifth year, 10 percent to 20 percent of the women were becoming infected each year, <PERSON> Goedert </PERSON> said. `` There is a steeply increasing risk of becoming infected in long-term relationships,'' <PERSON> Goedert </PERSON> said. `` The more partners, the more the risk,'' <PERSON> Goedert </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> said that the transmission of AIDS among heterosexuals will continue to grow. `` More and more women are acquiring the disease through heterosexual contact,'' he said. `` The data are too incomplete for firm conclusions,'' he said, but `` heterosexual transmission will be increasingly important _ without explosive increases, as we're seeing in IV -LRB- intravenous -RRB- drug abusers and gay men in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Goedert </PERSON> said that a person infected with the AIDS virus becomes more able to transmit it when the disease progresses to the point where laboratory tests reveal an immune system deficiency _ even though there may be no visible symptoms. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redfield </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said that the gradual spread of AIDS to heterosexuals is being accompanied by another unfortunate trend. `` We have mounting evidence that the virus is steadily creeping into the young people,'' he said. Among 17-year-old applicants to the armed forces, women are twice as likely to be infected as men, suggesting that the women acquired the infection from heterosexual contact with older men, he said. About 60 percent of the nation's approximately 18,000 hemophiliacs are now infected with the AIDS virus, <PERSON> Goedert </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> said the best available evidence now is that 40 percent of people infected with the virus will develop AIDS within nine years after becoming infected, and the rate at which they develop AIDS is likely to climb as even more time goes by. AIDS is a disease in which a virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> reported in April, 1988, that there were 88,031 AIDS cases reported worldwide since 1981, including 57,575 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

As they talked outside the capital, about 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cypriot </ORGANIZATION>, Armenian and Kurdish demonstrators in the city burned <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> flags outside the <ORGANIZATION> Turkish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and shouted `` Fire for the Turkish dogs!'' Hundreds of helmeted riot police guarded the embassy building but there were no clashes, witnesses said. No signs emerged of a breakthrough on the major disputes over <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> during Monday's one hour of talks between Premiers <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mesut </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON>, the But Turkish foreign minister, told reporters later: `` The meeting was held in a very friendly atmosphere and all bilateral problems and international issues were handled,'' <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> began a three-day visit to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> on Monday, the first by a Turkish premier in 36 years. Pro-government and opposition Greek newspapers both gave him a cool reception. `` Frozen Smiles'' was the headline in 24 Hours, an independent <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> daily. `` The country receives <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> with a cold heart,'' said the pro-government <ORGANIZATION> Avriani </ORGANIZATION>. In separate statements before the talks started, both leaders made clear they did not expect immediate major advances on the main disputes. On Monday night, <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> was guest of honor at a dinner beside the the swimming pool of a seaside hotel in <LOCATION> Vouliagmeni </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, where he and <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> are staying. `` There is no room for petty designs, one-sided gains and short-sighted tactics,'' <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> said in his speech, in an apparent reference to Greek demands that Turkish troops leave <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> said in his speech he had revived an earlier proposal for demilitarization of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island and establishing a joint <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> and Turkish Cypriot police force. `` It's clear that progress in Greek-Turkish relations is directly affected by the solution of the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> problem ... and this is directly linked with the withdrawal of troops from the island,'' he said. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> will drive into downtown <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> on Tuesday to lay a wreath at the Monument of the Unknown Soldier outside <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, then hold more private talks with <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> in the evening. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> began his visit with an appeal for patience on the `` the long road -LRB- to peace -RRB- on which we have started journeying.'' `` We must have realistic expectations, otherwise the disappointments to be suffered will take us away from our main goal,'' he told reporters. `` The problems go back a long time and as solutions were delayed some of these problems petrified and prejudices increased.'' When <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> arrived at the airport, only a few red-and-white Turkish flags were displayed and a Greek commando squad in camouflage battle-dress formed the honor guard. The neighbors came to the brink of war in March 1987 over oil-drilling rights in the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> seabed. The near-clash apparently convinced <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> to alter his no-dialogue policy toward <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and seek friendlier relations. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> wants <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> to pull its troops out of northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and agree on a joint appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to settle the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> continental shelf dispute. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> says <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> will not be pressured into withdrawing its forces from <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and prefers Greek-Turkish talks to solve the Aegean problem. The soldiers were sent after a brief Greek-led coup in July 1974.

<HEAD>Jackson Says Even If Veep Spot Not Offered, He Could Back Dukakis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> expressed confidence Monday that he could rally his supporters behind certain <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, even if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does n't pick him as a running mate. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> continued to stress that he is entitled to `` serious consideration'' for the No. 2 spot on the ticket. Even if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picks someone else, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters here, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor could expect backing from him `` so long as our agreements are rational, fair and consistent.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> sought to put the focus on harmony with the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp, citing the weekend agreement that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> shuld be branded a `` terrorist state.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had strongly pushed that view, and, at a preliminary platform-drafting meeting in <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> forces went along. The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> position `` is a step in the right direction for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because we must regain our credibility and our moral authority in the third world as leader of the free world,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at an impromptu sidewalk news conference here. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has backed strong sanctions and a divestiture of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to protest its apartheid policies of racial segregation. But the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor had resisted branding <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a `` terrorist state'' in the same category of states as <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` Our agreeing to declare <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state and thereby pointing to apply anti-terrorist legislation to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is a real hope to people throughout the world who seek fairness and justice,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. He said there was `` a good tone'' to the negotiations with the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp. `` So far they -LRB- the talks -RRB- are having an impact on broadening and strengthening the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> noted that major differences remain, including <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' refusal to support the freeze on military spending that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has called for, and the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> forces' resistance to the tax hikes <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wants. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for a weekend of meetings with members of his national staff to discuss plans for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> next month. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he planned to deliver several major policy speeches before the convention outlining his programs for health care, education, the war on drugs, and foreign and defense policy. He also met Monday with the editorial board of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and with officials of <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, publishers of Jet and Ebony magazines.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said `` proliferation is winning the race against disarmament,'' and told the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that all nations should sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secretary of state said the danger of proliferation is `` most acute'' in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, meaning <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and its rival <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Both have refused to sign the treaty and accuse each other of developing nuclear weapons. He said that 136 nations have signed the 20-year-old treaty and `` there is no good reason why every nation should not make such a commitment. It is a contribution each and every state can make to a safer world.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` concerned about the introduction of advanced missiles into the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war'' because they have killed civilians. Hundreds of people were killed on both sides earlier this year when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> rained missiles on each other's cities. Most of the weapons were believed to be Scud missiles of an old Soviet design, some of them equipped with boosters for longer range. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> address to a special <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session on disarmament came a week after Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to join a permament nuclear test ban. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> did not respond to a series of Soviet proposals that won praise from many in the 159-member assembly. In his speech, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> outlined American achievements in arms control and said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s `` top priority'' in the field is concluding a U.S.-Soviet treaty to cut strategic nuclear arsenals by 50 percent. `` Does anyone doubt that the spread of nuclear weapons threatens regional and global security?'' he said. `` What state believes that, if it now acquired nuclear weapons, its rivals would not do the same?'' Now that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have agreed to reduce their nuclear arsenals, `` it would be tragic for other countries to pursue the capability to cross the nuclear threshhold,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> is the area of greatest danger, and urged countries in the region `` to take concrete steps to meet this urgent challenge. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is prepared to work with countries inside and outside the region to find a lasting solution to the danger of proliferation that satisfies all parties.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was among the final few of more than 100 speakers who have addressed the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> since the special session began two weeks ago. In his remarks about the Iran-Iraq war, which began in September 1980, he said: `` We already are seeing signs of a dangerous new arms race which will put at risk countries far removed from the gulf region itself.'' Use of the missiles and the killing of civilians makes a peace settlement more difficult, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> session has been divided over key disarmament questions and diplomatic observers said it will be difficult to draft a final document which can satisfy most nations and be adopted by consensus. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and Western allies have called for limited, pragmatic steps in arms control, continued respect for nuclear deterrence, a limited role for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and recognition that bilateral arms talks must supersede multilateral efforts. They say the treaty on intermediate-range nuclear weapons and some progress in U.S.-Soviet talks on 50-percent cuts on strategic weapons show that bilateral efforts should be allowed to continue unencumbered by a multilateral apparatus. Western diplomats also have said that conventional disarmament is as important as nuclear disarmament and urged poor developing nations which clamor for nuclear disarmament to cut their own mounting expenditure in conventional armies. After the speeches end Tuesday or Wednesday, groups will begin drafting resolutions and a final document for this third special session on disarmament in 10 years. But if the divisions are too great and the disarmament proposals too sweeping and utopian, Western nations are expected to demand a vote, making consensus unlikely.

<HEAD>Jaruzelski Appeals For Reconciliation, But Not With Solidarity</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> appealed Monday for national reconciliation and expressed willingness to legalize new associations and cooperate with `` communities'' outside official life _ but not with Solidarity. `` We can talk to anyone, as long as he is not a client, especially a paid one, of a foreign court,'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said. He referred to grants of $ 1 million the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government gave to Solidarity after it became the first free trade union federation in the Soviet bloc. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> gave the major policy address at the start of a two-day meeting of the 230-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>' -LRB- Communist -RRB- Party. He is party first secretary and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON>, national spokesman for the now outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> federation </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview that any claim that Solidarity is disloyal to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> did not merit a response. He noted that both <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the communist government have accepted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid in the past and added, `` We are in very strange company.'' It was the first Central Committee plenum since a series of strikes between April 25 and May 10. Five factories were struck and 25 other plants endured brief stoppages or strike threats in the strongest labor action since Solidarity was suspended in December 1981 and subsequently outlawed. Solidarity had been chartered by the government during nationwide strikes in August 1980. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> accused the leaders of the recent strikes of an `` almost pathological lack of responsibility'' and said they could not be `` an objectively credible partner in dialogue.'' But he said authorities are ready to talk with critics who want to improve the state. `` National reconciliation is a basic condition and one of the goals of socialist renewal,'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said. `` It is broader today than in past years.'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said a planned new law on associations would lift administrative restrictions and grant the associations more freedom. In the meantime, officials should legally register new, `` socially justified'' groups, he said. He mentioned no groups specifically. Indications have emerged that at least three suppressed groups _ the pro-private enterprise <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>; the Polish chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> writer's club and the <LOCATION> Dziekania </LOCATION> political discussion club _ may soon be registered. About 300 mostly non-controversial private associations were legalized last year, but applications of many other groups were not approved, including local chapters of Solidarity and the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said `` ideas and practices are crystalizing slowly'' for cooperation with what he called independent communities that have refused to join PRON, the official national unity organization. He proposed a permanent wage-price commission with representatives of labor, management and consumers that would seek a social consensus for price increases. He said this would avoid periodic across-the-board price increases like one this year and instead aim at a floating system with prices evolving gradually. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> noted that Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> next month and said the trip will add a `` new, significant chapter'' to Polish-Soviet relations.

 Soviet troops are leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> `` faster than we all expected,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator who negotiated the withdrawal said Monday. <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> refused to say how many Red Army troops have pulled out since the Geneva Accord took effect May 15. He also said he is disturbed by allegations the pact is being violated. The Soviets said they had 100,300 troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as of May 15 and would withdraw one-fourth of them by early June. Western intelligence agencies had estimated Soviet troop strength as up to 115,000. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> on Monday spoke of `` resolute retaliatory measures'' if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> continues to aid Moslem guerrillas battling the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime. The warning was the first of its kind directly from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. It came as sources in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> forces had returned to some cities in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to fight guerrillas who raided posts defended by Afghan troops. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> distributed a joint statement over the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> saying: `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> believed that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Mission monitoring compliance with the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords would adopt ... effective measures to curb the practice -LRB- of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s aiding the guerrillas -RRB- which, if continued would make it necessary to undertake the most resolute retaliatory steps.'' Last week, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of violating the accords by aiding the guerrillas and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> might have to review its troop withdrawal schedule. Both were in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last to attend a special <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> conference on disarmament. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, in turn, has accused Afghanistan of intruding on its airspace and territory. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Nawaz </PERSON>, said Monday that `` the world will not be surprised if a crumbing -LRB- Afghan -RRB- regime makes a desperate bid to retain the protective umbrella of foreign troops, the withdrawal of which is the central element of the Geneva Accords.'' He addressed the 159-nation <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> during a special session on disarmament. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said later in a news conference: `` Let me say that nothing that has happened was not foreseen in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. It is unfortunate that we have encountered difficulties, and I am ... concerned about them.'' He said the accord `` envisages violations'' and has procedures to deal with them. `` It was also expected, of course, that some people would make a lot of noise,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official. `` The withdrawal has been going on very well ... faster than we all expected, and when people now talk about -LRB- the withdrawal -RRB- slowing down, I would say, in reference to what? The agreement provides simply that 50 percent of the troops should be out by the 15th of August. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said he would visit <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> at the end of the month to review the implementation of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. Soviet troops first entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> at the end of 1979 to support its Marxist government. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> mediated the accord between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> aimed at restoring peace in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> signing as guarantors of the pact. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> adjoins <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, is headquarters for all major Afghan guerrilla organizations and shelters about 3.5 million Afghan refugees.

 <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, the Arab-American advocate of non-violent protest who was deported by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Monday, got his first taste of passive resistance as a student in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> during the early 1960s. When he returned home to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in 1983 after 13 years in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> applied these ideas to the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict, calling for civil disobedience to protest <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Awad remained largely unknown until Israeli authorities ordered him deported last month, saying he played a role in inciting the Arab uprising that began last Dec. 8 `` He openly and intensely acts against Israeli control,'' read a decision last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upholding the deportation order. His case drew worldwide attention and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> tried to intercede on his behalf. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s American-born wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON>, said her husband never tried to be a leader, but she noted his ideas for boycotts of Israeli products and non-payment of taxes are being used in the uprising. `` If you read an article <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> wrote in 1983 and read today's underground leaflets, it's almost as if he envisioned what was going to happen,'' she said in a telephone interview Ms. <PERSON> Nye </PERSON>, however, has denied Israeli charges that her husband wrote leaflets advocating violence. He has been criticized by Israelis for not speaking out against violent attacks by Palestinian militants. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, a soft-spoken man with graying, curly hair, said in a statement addressing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s government last week: `` You have the power, the law and the gun pointing in my face. I am armed with hope, truth and non-violence.'' <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on Aug. 22, 1943, the fifth of seven children of a Greek Orthodox father and a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> mother. His father was killed by a stray bullet near his home during the 1948 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> and his siblings were sent to orphanages and boarding schools while his mother worked as a nurse. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> graduated from an Anglican school in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and in the early 1960s went to <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a Pentecostal school in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, intending to become a minister. But Ms. <PERSON> Nye </PERSON> said <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> after a little more than a year, repelled by the racial discrimination he saw. `` But there he first became interested in <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and the methods of resistance he advocated,'' Ms. <PERSON> Nye </PERSON> said. `` This was reinforced by his education at a Mennonite school,'' she said. `` He participated in anti-war demonstrations in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and from there it was just a natural progression.'' <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> taught for several years, then in 1970 he returned to <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to study at <ORGANIZATION> Bluffton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a Mennonite school in <LOCATION> Bluffton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Later, he earned a master's degree in counseling from <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> institution in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, and a doctorate from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. In January 1978, he launched the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, which offered community service programs for troubled youths. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in 1983 and two years later founded the Palestinian Center for Non-Violence. He lectured on civil disobedience, counseled teachers against corporal punishment and planted olive trees in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> villages to underscore the Arabs' claim to the land

<HEAD>Judgeship Nominee Accused of Keeping Liens `Hanging Over a Dying
Man'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nominee for a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> judgeship was accused at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing Monday of keeping property liens `` hanging over a dying man'' in a lawsuit filed by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic Committee. <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, nominated for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district court judgeship for northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, sharply disagreed with the statement by the attorney who opposed him in the trademark infringement case. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at his confirmation hearing there was `` nothing malicious'' in his representation of the <ORGANIZATION> USOC </ORGANIZATION> against the late <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON>, an AIDS victim who spent the last years of his life trying to organize athletic games he wanted to call the `` Gay Olympics.'' The nominee was among 13 current or former judicial candidates listed by Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION> as victims of a Democratic plot to delay <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s judgeship nominees in the waning days of his administration. Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., who presided at the hearing, said many of the delays were caused by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s tardiness in responding to committee information requests on Other delays resulted because Democrats wanted to investigate nominees thoroughly `` before they are given a lifetime charter to sit in judgment on the rights and liberties of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, not afterwards,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. There were two major issues in <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s nomination: his membership in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, which has few black members and does not allow its female members to vote; and his conduct in representing the Olympic committee, a case in which the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> eventually ruled the <ORGANIZATION> USOC </ORGANIZATION> had exclusive use of the Olympic name and the gay organization could not use it. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said he has been working from within to get the Olympic Club to change its policies, with some recent success. He promised to resign if current efforts to recruit minorities and allow full voting rights to women become stalled. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> resigned from the same club because he disagreed with the policies toward minorities and women. In the Olympic case, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> was retained by the <ORGANIZATION> USOC </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 to prevent use of the `` Gay Olympics'' name. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district judge ordered that <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON> _ a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic decathlon athlete _ and a gay organization were liable for $ 96,000 in attorneys fees, and <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> slapped liens against <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON>'s home and other property in an effort to collect the money. The liens were not removed until six days after <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON>'s death due to AIDS in July 1987. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> defended his actions, saying a federal appellate court ruling in the case automatically dissolved the liens. But the attorney for <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON>, told the committee that she and <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON>'s estate lawyer were unable to get the liens removed without <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s agreement, which he refused to give. She said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> left the liens `` hanging over a dying man at the time he needed to know his daughter would inherit his estate.'' Ms. <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> contended that <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> `` misrepresented the facts'' to the committee by telling senators that she had done nothing to obtain an order removing the liens. Ms. <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> said that she and <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON>'s estate lawyer repeatedly tried without success to get <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> to sign a release. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> has drawn opposition from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s gay community and the city's Board of Supervisors, which voted unanimously against the nomination. His main supporter, Republican Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, told the committee: `` What principle of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> jurisprudence is more fundamental than that due process of the law requires that however unpopular a client, that client and that client's cause of action are entitled to be represented by competent counsel.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> used similar language in defending himself, telling <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, `` I was perfectly aware of how unpopular the position was.'' But he added that the committee should be looking for judicial candidates `` willing to take stands'' that are legally correct, `` even though they may be unpopular.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said the Olympic committee held firm on the lien, adding it did so in the hope that the gay organization working with <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON> _ <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> _ would raise the money for the attorney fees. `` The client made the decision it had the right to recover the cost of the suit. That was a perfectly legitimate decision on their part,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said, adding, `` I was not at liberty'' to go against his client. He added that in his opinion, `` The liens were ineffective after the court of appeals judgment'' which vacated them. If that were so, <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> asked, `` Why did n't you sign the release?'' `` The client wanted to pursue it,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said.

 A Canadian man has been arrested and charged with obtaining classified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military documents that could have been useful to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or East bloc countries, the government announced Monday. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratkai </PERSON>, 25, was arrested Saturday in St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, following an investigation by the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> intelligence, according to Solicitor General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON>. The minister declined to say if <PERSON> Ratkai </PERSON> actually passed or tried to pass the documents to anyone, but he said the offense involved a `` foreign agent.'' He said that information would come out in court. <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON> gave no details of the contents of the documents. The Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a television report said the papers involved operations at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval base at <LOCATION> Argentia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian military forces cooperate in monitoring the movements of Soviet submarines. The solicitor general said no Soviet diplomats or citizens residing in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> were involved `` to our knowledge.'' `` But we believe the information _ the documents _ would be useful to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and-or other East bloc countries,'' <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Ratkai </PERSON> was not a member of the Canadian armed forces or government but was believed to be a native-born Canadian citizen. He gave no other details on <PERSON> Ratkai </PERSON>'s background. <PERSON> Ratkai </PERSON> was charged under a section of the Official Secrets Act that prohibits the gathering or passing of classified documents or information that could be of use to a foreign power and could harm the interests of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and its allies. The offense carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. <PERSON> Ratkai </PERSON> was arraigned in a St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s court on Sunday and is scheduled to appear in court again on Wednesday.

 <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> was a teen-ager, fascinated by movie stars and working in a 5-and-10, when she took up smoking in the early 1940s. She smoked for 40 years. In 1981, she learned that she had lung cancer, and she died in 1984 when she was 58 years old. But before her death, Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> and her husband <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> sued the three companies that made the cigarettes she smoked, charging that they were responsible for her disease. `` I was sure that if there was anything that dangerous, that the tobacco people would n't allow it and the government would n't let them'' sell cigarettes, she said. During the four-month trial which ended in federal court here Monday, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s story was told by her husband and her children, and by herself in pre-trial statements read to the jury. `` She was, how you say, friendly, outgoing,'' <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> testified. `` She was a beautiful woman.'' She was born <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFrancesco </PERSON> on Dec. 17, 1925 at her parents' home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> She described herself as a happy child who taught herself to play piano. Another hobby was cutting out movie star pictures and pasting them in a scrapbook. She met her husband <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> at an open-air opera during a street festival, and they married in 1947 after a chaperoned courtship. They had three children. Nothing in her life was as miserable as the chemotherapy that followed the diagnosis of lung cancer, <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> testified. `` She wanted to live so bad. She did n't want to think about it,'' he said.

 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> on Monday warned of `` resolute retaliatory measures'' if <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> continues to help Moslem rebels fighting the Afghan government. The warning, the first of its kind directly from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, came as sources in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> reported that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> forces returned to some cities in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to fight guerrillas who raided posts defended by Afghan troops. Since shortly before the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit that ended last week, the Soviets have been warning <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that continuing to arm the guerrillas violated the accords signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on May 15. Under those accords, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> agreed to withdraw its 100,300 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15. Western intelligence agencies put the number of Soviet forces involved as up to 115,000. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not issue any warnings about <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> during the summit, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, who predicted then that the Soviets would complete the withdrawal. Thousands of Soviet troops already have returned home. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials rejected Soviet complaints about aid still flowing to the Moslem rebels, noting an exchange of letters between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> that each side would arm its Afghan allies as long as the other did so. A joint Najib-Gorbachev statement distributed over the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said: `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> believed that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Mission monitoring compliance with the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords would adopt ... effective measures to curb the practice -LRB- of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s aiding the guerrillas -RRB- which, if continued would make it necessary to undertake the most resolute retaliatory steps.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> had made a similar warning after meeting with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. And <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> lashed out against <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> for maintaining what he called an `` infrastructure of interference _ military camps, training centers for the armed groups of the opposition, all manner of subversive, terroristic groups'' on Pakistani territory. He also attacked a White House statement that he said tried to justify <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s continued supply of arms to the rebels, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> rejected a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for mutual termination of aid. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> never agreed to its military aid to the legitimate government in the Republic of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> being linked in any form with arms supplies to the insurgent illegal groups which bank on the forcible overthrow of the government,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Anti-Smoking Forces Hail Decision But Industry Analysts Discount
Impact</HEAD>

 Anti-smoking forces hailed a federal jury's decision Monday to hold a cigarette company partially responsible for the death of a smoker but analysts discounted any long-term impact for the industry `` Mighty <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> has struck out,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blum </PERSON>, a teacher at the <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> who founded the anti-smoking group <ORGANIZATION> Doctors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oughta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION>. However, because the jury did not find the tobacco industry conspired to mislead the public about the dangers of smoking, analysts said the verdict could be considered a victory for the $ 35 billion tobacco industry. `` I think it's probably the second-best decision they could have hoped for,'' said analyst <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Pidgeon </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The decision in the case of <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>, who died of lung cancer after 40 years of smoking, exonerated the <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of conspiracy. The jury did find that <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> failed to warn the public about the dangers of smoking and violated its promise to consumers to make a safe product, contributing to Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s illness. The jury awarded $ 400,000 in damages to widower <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> from <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>, which faced separate charges because it made the brand of cigarettes Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> smoked before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> required health warnings on cigarette packs in 1966. <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> has promised an appeal. `` It's bittersweet for <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s attorneys since they won but it was n't necessarily on the charges they wanted or for they amount they wanted,'' said <PERSON> Pidgeon </PERSON>. The two companies that were exonerated have `` a bit of breathing room,'' while `` obviously for <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> it's quite serious,'' he added. Financial markets were closed when the jury made its decision but <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> tobacco analyst, said he expects only short-term damage to industry stocks. `` It's a loss but not a major loss,'' <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> said. `` The only way this would be considered a negative is if the award made it exciting for other -LRB- law -RRB- firms to sue. I do n't think that happened.'' He said stocks might drop early Tuesday but would probably rebound during the day. <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which specializes in stock trading when the exchanges are closed, did not handle any tobacco stock transactions after the ruling although there were many calls for information, trading assistant <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` We've had a lot of inquiries, but everybody's trying to assess the news,'' Ms. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. The only offer was a bid of $ 80 per share with the buyer seeking to sell at $ 84 a share, she said. The tobacco companies waged an expensive defense _ the cost has been been put at $ 50 million by one industry analyst _ because they feared a loss in the case could open the way for many more liability suits. The verdict marks the first time a jury has found any degree of liability but anti-smoking forces and tobacco industry representatives indicted it was not the clear victory for which both sides were hoping. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bleakley </PERSON> said he thought the verdict represented a compromise on the part of the jury. `` I think they had a holdout,'' he speculated. The jurors _ one smoker, two who quit and three who never smoked _ would not comment on the case. <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearney </PERSON> said he was very pleased by the verdict and thought it would discourage further liability suits. `` The jury specifically rejected any claims of damages,'' he said. `` The flood gates have been closed even firmer than they were before.'' <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edell </PERSON>, the attorney for <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>, said he saw a partial victory in the jury's conclusion that `` that the cigarette companies should have warned people as early as the 1940s about the health hazards of cigarette smoking.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daynard </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liability </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> supports lawsuits against the industry, went further: `` It's the first time tobacco companies have been held accountable for the death and diseases their products cause. It's a tremendous victory. I've been waiting four years to say something like that. I think it will be a tremendous encouragement to plaintiffs and plaintiffs' attorneys to say, ` You can do it.''' `` This could be the beginning of the end for tobacco companies,'' added <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Banzhaf </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unversity </ORGANIZATION> law professor who directs an anti-smoking group. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of government relations for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, called the verdict the `` opening salvo in what will probably be a long battle.'' Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., the chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that has scheduled hearings for July on possible federal regulation of the sale and promotion of tobacco, said `` the jury's decision represents a signifcant and long overdue breakthrough. `` This crack in the tobacco industry's liability armor will have implications far beyond the specifics of this case,'' he said.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Hit Parts of Rockies, Plains; Drought Continues in
Some Areas</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Scattered thunderstorms increased and intensified rapidly Monday afternoon over the foothills of the central <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> and into the central high Plains. But a drought continued in northern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and caused fires in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Most of the thunderstorms were over <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. Hail, two inches in diameter, occurred early Wednesday afternoon about 20 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Small hail was reported at <LOCATION> Laramie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. A severe thunderstorm watch was in effect until Monday evening for a large part of southeast <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and a small part of the <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> panhandle, while showers and thunderstorms over <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> diminished. Thunderstorms were widely scattered over coastal sections of southeast <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The drought, which has withered lawns and crops and caused watering bans across northern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, entered its 20th day. Since May 24, no measureable rain has fallen over <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> _ the longest such period for this time of the year. The only year that comes close to the current dry spell was in 1886, when a tenth of an inch fell from May 24 to June 12. Compounding the problem is that rainfall across northern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> was much below normal throughout April and May as well. Wind and dry conditions fueled a fire that burned through thousands of acres of a rural <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> area Monday as more than 100 firefighters fought to contain it. Officials were helping evacuate an undetermined number of people whose houses lie in its path. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Monday, hot weather continued breaking or tying high temperature marks. Afternoon readings were in the lower 90s at many locations. <LOCATION> Marquette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, broke its record high for the day with an 88-degree reading and <LOCATION> Alpena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, tied its record for the date with 92 degrees. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, it was hot, too. The temperature at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> airport in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> reached 94 degrees before a sea breeze set in during the early afternoon. The temperature at south <LOCATION> Weymouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> reached 98 degrees at 2 p.m. Most readings across <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> were in the upper 80s to lower 90s. Much of the remainder of the eastern half of the nation had temperatures about 90 degrees but with low relative humidities. The low humidity helps to keep the air feel reasonably comfortable, but the downside is that it is maintaining the dry weather plaguing portions of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and the Southeast. Cloudiness and spotty light rain kept temperatures across <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> on the cool side. Afternoon readings were mostly in the 50s to lower 60s. West of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>, sunshine and mild temperatures prevailed. Early afternoon readings were mostly in the 60s and 70s but ranged up to the 90s in the desert Southwest. Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 51 degrees at <LOCATION> Livingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, to 97 degrees at the <LOCATION> Weymouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>; Needles, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Inyokern </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The low for the nation Monday morning was 28 degrees at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecast scattered showers and thunderstorms extending from the upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> across the northern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and western portions of the southern Plains to eastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. Thunderstorms were predicted to be most numerous over <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Scattered showers were expected over northern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and showers and thunderstorms should continue over central and southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Threatens Execution of Those Dumping Toxic Wastes</HEAD>

 The military government said Monday it will execute anyone convicted of involvement in dumping foreign toxic waste in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Duro </PERSON> <PERSON> Onabule </PERSON>, spokesman for President <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Babangida </PERSON>, said the death penalty also might apply to foreigners connected with the dumping of more than 2,000 tons of chemical waste near the town of <LOCATION> Koko </LOCATION>, including poisonous and radioactive material. <PERSON> Koko </PERSON> is 150 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION>, capital of this West African nation. Prince <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Momoh </PERSON>, the information minister, said at a separate news conference that 15 people had been arrested in the Koko dumping. He did not identify them but said an Italian who directed the operation, <PERSON> Gianfranco </PERSON> <PERSON> Raffaelli </PERSON>, fled the country after newspapers reported the dumping. `` There will be no mercy on this issue,'' Onabule told reporters. `` We would rather do away with 20 Nigerians, stupid Nigerians, than allow them to endanger the lives of millions of Nigerians and fellow Africans.'' He said the government seized the land on which the waste was dumped. Last Friday the government said it had seized an Italian ship that would be forced to remove the waste and recalled its ambassador from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. An Italian firm was accused of dumping the waste for European companies. Police guarding the site in <LOCATION> Bendel </LOCATION> state were withdrawn Sunday for their own safety, the Nes Agency of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> reported. It said confirmation by chemists that the waste included poisonous substances prompted removal of the policemen, who had been stationed around the site to keep the public away. Scientists urged anyone who had been near the site to have a medical examination. Attempts by European and American companies to dump toxic waste in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have provoked protests in recent weeks. Five Congolese, including three senior government officials, were arrested after a dumping scheme was discovered there. <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> arrested a Norwegian businessman and charged him with complicity in dumping American waste on an island near the capital, <LOCATION> Conakry </LOCATION>. Several other countries said they had refused lucrative offers from Western companies seeking permission to dump chemical waste.

 A district attorney has asked for more information in his examination of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request for extradition of a Palestinian accused in the bombings of two American jetliners, judicial sources said Monday. They said the request for <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>'s extradition `` was n't backed by hard enough evidence that would support opening extradition proceedings. District Attorney <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Spyropoulos </PERSON>, who is handling the case, told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities Greek law sets a two-month time limit for providing needed information in extradition requests, according to the sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified. `` What the Americans have so far provided wo n't do, and if the additional evidence has n't landed on the district attorney's two months from now, the proceedings ca n't be pursued,'' one source said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asked <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> for the immediate extradition of <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, `` a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorist wanted in connection'' with the August 1982 explosion aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> passenger jet in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The blast killed one person and wounded 15. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was heartened by the Greek government's June 7 statement saying it was dedicated to the international fight against terrorism. `` We strongly believe that the most effective way to fight terrorism in this case is to expeditiously begin extradition proceedings against <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>,'' he added. It was the first time the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration publicly acknowledged it was seeking <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, 34. American officials admitted privately last week that they were seeking <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>'s extradition but declined to make the case public, citing the delicacy of the negotiations. <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> was arrested at the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> June 1 by Greek police acting on information from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to police. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said last week <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> also is wanted in connection with a 1986 explosion aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane flying over <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in which four people were killed. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> did not mention that case in his brief statement on <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to publicly comment on the case came after a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> security official in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> said earlier Monday that <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> would try <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> on the charge of using a false Syrian passport to enter the country. If convicted on that count, <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> could be given a jail term of 1 -LCB- to two years to be served before an extradition hearing took place, said the security official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Government spokesman <PERSON> Yiannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Roubatis </PERSON> declined to comment on the case. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> has followed a similar procedure in delaying extradition proceedings until a suspect served a misdemeanor sentence. A Jordanian arrested at the Greek-Turkish border in 1982 is still awaiting extradition to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, where he is wanted for allegedly plotting an attack at a <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> synagogue that killed a boy. The Jordanian, <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Osama </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Zomor </PERSON>, served a 20-month sentence for smuggling explosives before the extradition request was heard. Although the request eventually was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Al-Zomor </PERSON> was sentenced again for being found in possession of an illegal weapon in his prison cell and remains in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s Socialist government, which has good relations with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, has been accused of being lax in fighting terrorism.

 Eight people died when a private plane with engine trouble crashed while trying to make an emergency landing Monday night. It was the country's second fatal air accident in as many days. Air authorities in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plata </LOCATION>, 30 miles south of the capital <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, said the pilot of the Havilland Dove twin-engine craft told the control tower he was having problems with one engine. He requested emergency landing rights, which were immediately granted, officials said. But the plane crashed in <LOCATION> Arana </LOCATION>, a community five miles from the airport, police at the scene said. Eight bodies were recovered, including that of a police inspector and two children, ages eight and nine, police said. The ninth victim was taken to a local hospital in serious condition, police said. On Sunday, an <ORGANIZATION> Austral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> DC-9 jetliner smashed into a hillside in heavy fog and burst into flames outside Posadas in northeastern <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. All 22 aboard were killed. The cause of that fiery accident, which claimed the lives of 15 passengers and seven crew members, is under investigation. Two of the victims were Japanese and a third was French. Austral is a private carrier bought last year from the state and competes with the government carrier <ORGANIZATION> Aerolineas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Argentinas </ORGANIZATION> on domestic routes.

<HEAD>Draft Report Advises Against Converting WPPSS I For Production
Reactor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A draft report for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> released Monday appears to favor a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> plant over the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state for development of a new defense production reactor, two senators said. Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., an opponent of converting the mothballed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Public Power Supply System No 1 nuclear reactor to defense use, said the report recommends against such a conversion. The report, released by an advisory panel to <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, seems to favor the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> for the new production reactor, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. The proposed reactor would replace three <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plants that now produce tritium for defense use. Tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, is a key ingredient in nuclear weapons. It decays relatively rapidly and so needs to be constantly replenished. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, said the report favored <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> because its current reactor technology _ heavy water _ was chosen as the best type for producing nuclear weapons materials. However, an executive summary of the report said: `` Each of the reactor types considered can meet the mission requirements of a new production reactor with varying degrees of risk as to cost and schedule ... Heavy water is the most mature technology. Others would require some research and development.'' The `` heavy water'' option is limited to defense use and could win favor `` by clearly separating defense missions from civilian use,'' the report said. The technology for recovering tritium from a converted <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> reactor does not exist, according to the report. The DOE report, said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, `` says what I have said many times: If we need to produce tritium we should build a special reactor designed for that purpose ... `` While these reports are preliminary, they only confirm my belief that conversion of <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> No. 1 is the wrong option and should not be pursued,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash., a supporter of <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> conversion, said the report's conclusions were `` by no means final. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said four of the advisory board's subcommittees are discussing possible technology for the reactor. `` Each subcommittee is inclined to sing the praises of its particular nuclear reactor technology. It's premature to speculate about the final decision,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said.

 Some Chinese officials already have been turned away at the door while others will come laden with gifts and promises of banquets to the biggest business conference ever held between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Nearly 1,000 Americans from 600 mostly smaller and medium-sized businesses are to attend the June 20-23 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Joint Session on Industry, <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> at the Great Hall of the People. They will discuss investment opportunities with about 800 Chinese officials from 22 provinces and municipalities. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>'s commercial officer, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, said it will be the first time so many smaller <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a nation they previously avoided because of the risks involved. The Chinese will try to convince the Americans they are eliminating investment risks, such as difficulty in repatriating profits, inadequate energy supplies, red tape, corruption and insufficient say over personnel matters. The event is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> People-to-People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, group founded in 1956 by President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganmei </PERSON>, organizer of the seminar, said Chinese trying to promote their respective regions for investment will set up about 100 booths in the Great Hall, the political center of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. She said about 30 cities have invited the American business executives to come for first-hand looks in post-seminar tours. `` We heard that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had the same kind of meeting and -LRB- Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> talked for 52 minutes. Well, ours is going to be bigger,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is now eagerly courting foreign investors in its drive for rapid economic development. The government has encouraged more-developed coastal areas in particular to set up export-oriented industries with the help of foreign money. According to Chinese statistics, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses contracted for 407 joint ventures and pledged investment of $ 3.1 billion as of the end of last year. That figure is second only to the amount invested by <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> said 95 percent of the Americans to attend the seminar will be coming to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for the first time, and Chinese are scrambling to be at the head of the line to greet them. Initially, she said, they planned to limit participation to representatives from coastal provinces, but later, under strong pressure, expanded to let in the industrial city of <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province, home of senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. Other provinces asking to participate have been rejected. She said the mayor of <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION>, an industrial city in the northeast, insisted on coming with a 15-member delegation. `` We told him no,'' she said, but added that in the end they may allow the city to send four or five observers. Ms. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> said their offices are already full of books, handouts and gifts prepared by provinces to woo the Americans, and that mayors and governors are vying to hold lunch and dinner banquets for the potential investors. <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province was spending $ 108,000 for gifts and investment guides and one province had plans to charter an aircraft to transport Americans to its cities. Among the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representatives at the meeting will be <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdnors </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lempert </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stamper </PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Nearly 5,000 people demonstrated in <LOCATION> Cap-Haitien </LOCATION> after the funeral of a young man who was killed by a soldier at a slum area courthouse a week ago, the radio station Haiti-Inter reported Monday. The protest occurred Saturday afternoon around <ORGANIZATION> Sacre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the poor La Fossette quarter of <LOCATION> Cap-Haitien </LOCATION>. Soldiers intervened when the crowd headed for the courthouse shouting anti-government slogans, and dispersed the demonstrators with tear gas and shots fired into the air, the radio said. One protester was beaten with a club, it said, but no arrests or further incidents were reported. <PERSON> Reynold </PERSON> <PERSON> Nivrose </PERSON>, 19, was shot dead June 6 by the sergeant-at-arms of the La Fossette courthouse, who had been ordered by a judge to arrest him. Nivrose had protested a ruling by the judge and fled when the sergeant-at-arms tried to make the arrest. <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Malebranche </PERSON>, outgoing president of the <ORGANIZATION> Port-au-Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview: `` Both the judge and the soldier acted illegally _ the judge, who is not authorized to order the arrest of a citizen, and the soldier, who used his firearm unnecessarily.''

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Monday deported <ORGANIZATION> Arab-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mubarak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Awad </ORGANIZATION>, an advocate of non-violent resistance to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation He flashed a defiant victory sign before police hustled him aboard a plane that flew him to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, troops carrying out a pre-dawn search in an isolated mountain village fatally shot a nearly deaf <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> man after he ignored orders to halt, hospital officials and villagers said. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders called for tougher measures, including shoot-to-kill orders, against Arabs throwing firebombs and setting fires to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s pastures and scarce forests. More than 2,500 acres were scorched in weekend blazes, and officials blamed most of the fires on Arab arsonists. American donors have planted 20 million trees in Israeli national parks, more than 10 percent of the country's trees. The Jerusalem-born <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> was driven to <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in a black windowless prison van under heavy guard. Wearing a white shirt and carrying a jacket, he waved and gave a victory sign before boarding the plane. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> arrived Monday night at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where about 50 demonstrators _ supporters as well as opponents of Awad _ gathered in the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> terminal. `` Awad wishes to express that he was happy to be out of jail after 40 days of incarceration,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke for <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> did not speak to reporters, but <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> said <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> planned to hold a news conference Tuesday. The deportation ended a seven-month legal battle to avoid expulsion. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> was the 21st Arab to be expelled since the Dec. 8 start of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> was kept away from reporters in an airport holding cell, but his letters to supporters from prison were distributed and shown to journalists. `` Even after my departure, my efforts will continue,'' <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> wrote. `` We have no choice but to continue with the uprising for our liberation.'' He vowed in the letters to return soon. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, a Christian, has said he might convert to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> as a means to return to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> deported, saying he played a key role in organizing te uprising. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Monday rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> condemnation of the order, saying if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were confronted with a similar case, `` the person would be expelled immediately with no second thoughts.'' `` We think it is unjustifiable to deny Mr. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> the right to stay and live in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> where he was born,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday. `` If he acted illegally, he should have been charged and tried in court with full due process of law. He should not have been deported.'' Awad denied inciting violence against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> but has supported the uprising in the territories that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Although he has little influence in the Palestinian community, some tactics he advocates, such as tax boycotts, were adopted by uprising leaders. About a dozen Israelis gathered at an airport gate to protest <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s deportation, unfurling banners and holding flowers. One banner read `` Mubarak: Next Year in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>,'' a reference to a traditional saying of Jews living outside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Police immediately confiscated the banners. A second protest was held in downtown <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> where 25 Awad supporters gathered. One held a poster that read: `` <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> was deported today, but his ideas remain.'' Dozens of angry Israelis staged an impromptu counter demonstration, shouting that <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> supporters were traitors. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Abwein </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dib </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, 43, was fatally shot in the head after he ignored soldiers' orders to halt, said Dr. <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. One villager, who identified himself only as <PERSON> Samy </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview that <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> was hard of hearing and probably never heard the order. <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> was killed during a search for troublemakers in which soldiers rounded up about 30 youths. The army confirmed the death but said it was investigating the circumstances. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> was the 207th Palestinian killed in the uprising. Two Israelis also have died. Three Arabs working for the military government were injured in an attack in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> on Monday, the army and hospital officials said. An Arab postman was stabbed and two other employees were beaten. Palestinian underground leaders have demanded that all Arabs working for the military government resign. After a weekend marred by an upsurge in Arab violence, including a firebomb attack in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s main mall, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders promised retaliation. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> he would introduce legislation to jail arsonists for up to 15 years. `` We must put an end to this,'' Industry Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` Those who throw firebombs must be shot with the intention to kill ... they must be warned these are the steps the army is going to take.'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told a closed-door Cabinet session he had authorized Israeli civilians to shoot at Arabs holding firebombs and in response to `` other imminent dangers,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday.

The three used a forklift vehicle and garden hose to scale the wall of the prison, taking a woman guard and a passing woman as hostages as they fled in a car. The hostages were released unharmed near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border. Officials said the convicts were seen climbing the prison wall and in an exchange of gunfire <PERSON> Henley </PERSON> and one guard were wounded. They said an investigation is under way to determine how the three convicts were armed and how they received the weapons.

 Diminishing winds helped firefighters battle a 9,800-acre brush fire on steep, rocky terrain in southern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Monday, and in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> most fire crews returned home after controlling a 17,000-acre grass fire that killed cattle and destroyed three homes. A small fire in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Angeles National Forest may have been started by a killer disposing of a woman's body. Firefighters elsewhere in the same forest Monday evening contained a 710-acre brush fire that may have been the work of an arsonist. And in southwest <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, firefighters struggled with at least five lightning-caused wildfires that charred more than 500 acres of grassland and trees. Authorities said the largest fire burned at least 400 acres of grass, brush, juniper trees and pockets of ponderosa pine trees on federal lands. Twenty-four fires were reported in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> from the lightning of a Friday afternoon storm, authorities said. `` Things are looking very good down along the border,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, a spokesman with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said winds died down Monday to 15 to 20 mph, allowing firefighters to work towards consolidating fire lines that have been cut along the flanks of the blaze. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said the fire, which started Friday in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, has consumed 2,500 acres in northwest <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> and 7,300 acres in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. He said firefighters hope to have the blaze contained by Wednesday evening. The blaze was named the Peaks fire because it was on <ORGANIZATION> Coronado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> slopes so steep that the fire-line elevation ranged from 5,200 feet to 7,200 feet. In southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the charred body of a woman was found early Monday in a small brush fire was an apparent homicide victim, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's officials said. Investigators believe the woman was killed elsewhere, dumped and set ablaze, said Deputy <PERSON> Gabe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>. That fire was fanned Sunday night by northeasterly winds gusting to 35 mph, but during the day Monday the wind shifted to the southwest, bringing in moist ocean air, said <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickman </PERSON>. The only reported loss was an apiary, but firefighters managed to save another set of beehives, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickman </PERSON> said. No injuries were reported. A fire that raced across 17,000 acres of parched <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> grassland, destroying three homes and killing cows, was declared under control Monday. An <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train apparently sparked the fire Friday in eastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Knudsen </PERSON>. The flames quickly spread into <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Williams </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. No serious injuries were reported. Most firefighters were withdrawn Monday. `` We've just got a few guys keeping an eye out, spot checks, but all the -LRB- fire -RRB- departments have returned in,'' <PERSON> Knudsen </PERSON> said. Officials were unsure how many head of cattle were lost in the fire. Cattle displaced by the fire were widely scattered, <PERSON> Knudsen </PERSON> said, adding: `` We definitely need hay or pasture, because we've got hundreds of head of cattle without anything to eat.

<HEAD>Report: 350 Trade Unionists Killed in 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At least 350 trade unionists were killed and 7,500 arrested worldwide during 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> said in a report released Tuesday. Despite improvements in some countries, `` the overall picture remains grim,'' the <ORGANIZATION> ICFTU </ORGANIZATION> said in its annual survey of anti-union violence. `` There is a tendency among governments to consider respect for trade union rights as less important than certain other human rights,'' it said. The rights violations occurred in both dictatorships and democracies, according to the Brussels-based <ORGANIZATION> ICFTU </ORGANIZATION>, which has 141 affiliates in 97 non-communist nations and claims it represents 87 million workers. Its 58-page report said violations last year of union rights ranged from denying the right of association to `` murder, torture and imprisonment.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ICFTU </ORGANIZATION> report said Latin American unionists faced the most ruthless treatment. It said that in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, more than `` 200 killings occurred related to disputes over landownership, many of which concerned leaders and members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` There is evidence'' most of the victims were slain by killers hired by landowners, according to the report. In <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, paramilitary groups killed at least 74 trade unionists and `` the real figure is probably much higher,'' it said. The report stated: `` The most flagrant trade union rights violations are undoubtedly taking place in countries under dictatorship, irrespective of their ideological orientation. `` However, in many countries, even those with long established democratic traditions, there are also restrictions and infringements of these rights.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ICFTU </ORGANIZATION> said laws in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> undermined the rights of trade unions and `` in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> serious cases of union-busting continue to occur.'' It gave this summary: _ <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>: In most nations, unions are controlled by the parties in power that forbid rivals, ban or curb the right to strike and interfere with the organization of union activities In <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, the trade union movement must by law follow Marxist theory and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` totally negates fundamental human rights.'' _ <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: `` Infringements of trade union rights continue to occur on a wide scale <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, among others, continue to violently suppress union activities.'' In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the human rights situation generally has improved but `` specific violations of trade union rights continue to occur'' including detention without trial and persecution of union members. _ <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>: In communist nations `` freedom of association, free collective bargaining and the right to strike do not exist. Anti-communist <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> used `` extreme police violence'' against strikers. _ <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>: The introduction of economic reforms in some East European nations did not boost trade union rights In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the courts rejected more than 30 applications for recognition by `` local enterprise sections'' belonging to the outlawed Solidarity union federation. Romanian police broke up a demonstration of union workers in November. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, `` the most outrageous attack on basic trade union rights in recent years continues to be the ban'' on union membership in the government's intelligence gathering center at <LOCATION> Cheltenham </LOCATION>. _ <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>: Some Arab nations allow only a single trade union and in others, such as <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, trade unions are banned Emergency regulations remain in force in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> `` to restrict human and trade union rights,'' the report said.

<TEXT>
 The federal government must cooperate with cities in combating drug abuse through military interdiction, law enforcement, treatment and education, mayors said Monday. The 56th Annual Conference of Mayors approved a sweeping platform calling for federalization of the war against drug abuse. `` We are turning into a banana republic,'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> told the mayors at a luncheon session. `` This country today is swimming in drugs.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said cities and states can no longer effectively battle drug dealing and use. He called for a national drug czar to coordinate federal efforts with local jurisdictions. `` The enemy as of this moment is drugs,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. `` The Russians did n't come yesterday, they did n't come today, and I hope they wo n't come tomorrow _ but drug dealers did.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> disagreed with mayors who have called for a cabinet-level secretary of public safety, saying such a post could lead to a national police force. However, he said drug offenders and dealers should be prosecuted under strict federal laws. The platform approved by the mayors called for the president to outline a national strategy for waging war on drugs; more money to finance the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s drug interdiction efforts; and legislation that would send much more federal money to local jurisdictions for drug enforcement, treatment and education. Virtually all 175 mayors attending the conference approved the platform, said conference spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> was the only mayor to address the session on drugs. Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, said drug interdiction is the service's top priority, but budget cuts have forced it to scale back by 55 percent the ships and personnel used to intercept illegal drug shipments. `` That, I think, is an outrage,'' he said. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said he supports military involvement in the drug war, but disagrees the responsibility should be turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Instead, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> should be charged with planning and executing interdiction efforts, he said.

 You viewers who never understood why friends and co-workers were mad for a TV villain can catch up beginning Wednesday when CBS reruns the `` Wiseguy'' episodes guest-starring <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON> as mobster <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Steelgrave </PERSON>. `` Wiseguy'' stars <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahl </PERSON> as undercover agent <PERSON> Vinnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Terranova </PERSON>, who was himself so charmed by <PERSON> Steelgrave </PERSON> he almost went over to the other side. He has since gone on to chase new villains. `` This is a whole new way to do television,'' said <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON>. `` You can get actors who do mostly movies, because you've got a story with a beginning, middle and end. It runs longer than a miniseries and you can develop a character. I've heard someone refer to this as a soap opera for tough guys. `` But I wo n't be back on ` Wiseguy' next season. I'm history. The only way I could come back is in a flashback. We may do that. We've gotten so many letters asking for me that I think we should give them something There's even a <ORGANIZATION> Sonny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelgrave </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. They write us each week asking us to bring back <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON>.'' Though the Steelgrave episodes that opened `` Wiseguy'' last fall attracted a following, the show was up against <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers'' and `` Night Court'' on Thursday night and did n't get big ratings. CBS is hoping that will change if a new audience catches the show this summer. Wednesday's episode is the two-hour movie that introduced the character. <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON>'s portrayal of <PERSON> Steelgrave </PERSON>, with his murderous, mercurial charm, has been likened to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cagney </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON> in `` White Heat,'' or <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantee </PERSON> in `` The Petrified Forest'' and <PERSON> Mad </PERSON> <PERSON> Dog </PERSON> <PERSON> Earle </PERSON> in `` High Sierra.'' <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON>'s apocalypse is nearly as spectacular as <PERSON> Cagney </PERSON>'s in the gasoline refinery in `` White Heat.'' `` I meet people who memorize <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON>'s dialogue and say it back to me,'' said <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON>. `` Just like ` The Rocky Horror Show.''' The role in `` Wiseguy'' was a much-needed boost for <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON>. He had made a big splash playing an ambitious manager in `` The Idolmaker'' in 1980, but his career dissolved into alcohol and drugs. `` I went at it full-blown,'' he said. `` It was fun for a while. Then it got crazy and by 1985 it was sickening. I lost great parts to guys who became big stars. I could n't get insured. I'd turn in my urine tests knowing I would never pass. `` I spent several years in and out of hospitals. I'd dry out, do a movie and end up back in the hospital. I finally found a place that dealt with the problem and not the personalities. I spent 62 days there, came out and went right to work.'' He was only four days out of the rehabilitation program when he began the role on `` Wiseguy.'' He is currently starring as a Puerto Rican angel in `` Wired,'' based on the controversial <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> book about <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Belushi </PERSON>, who died of a drug overdose. The angel is a fantasy element added to the movie. <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON> says it's like playing the dark side of `` It's a Wonderful Life.'' The angel picks up <PERSON> Belushi </PERSON> at the morgue `` and shows him the error of his ways.'' `` It's great,'' <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON> said, `` because he gets in all the <ORGANIZATION> Blues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> dance numbers and the ` Saturday Night Live' comedy sketches.'' In August, <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON> is set to co-star with <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Bisset </PERSON> in the romantic comedy `` Scenes From a Class Struggle in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>.'' In September, he is slated to play attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>, the former aide to Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> who died of AIDS. After finishing the `` Wiseguy'' shooting in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for the movie `` Act of Piracy,'' playing `` a really bad guy, a gun smuggler and modern-day pirate in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Those guys'll kill your whole family and take your boat to run guns or drugs.'' `` Sonny's different. He was a man who could carry out his own brand of ethics. He did it with such charm and lack of guilt. And, I think the audience likes to see bad boys having fun. <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> was a man who was very family-oriented. His attitude was ` Do n't judge me by what I do for a living.'''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s Law may never be abolished, but it appears to have been at least temporarily suspended for the benefit of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. The proposition that `` whatever can go wrong will go wrong'' seemed an apt one for followers of economic affairs over the past couple of decades. Recessions alternated with outbursts of inflation until the two evils finally came together in a phenomenon that was dubbed `` stagflation.'' When a long period of growth finally arrived in the 1980s, it had to be financed with huge deficits in the federal budget and international trade. Then the stock market crashed. But in 1988, for a change, the surprises have been almost entirely on the positive side. As midyear approaches, there is little sign of any of the woes that many pundits were forecasting at New Year's. `` When the year began, it appeared that the challenges facing the global economy would prove too difficult to overcome without a serious slowdown, if not an outright recession,'' observed <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Resler </PERSON>, chief economist at the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Avoiding that unhappy outcome would require robust growth in foreign demand for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods, plus an adequate expansion of manufacturing capacity so that both foreign and domestic demands could be satisfied at reasonably stable prices.'' In addition, <PERSON> Resler </PERSON> said, `` consumer spending would need to increase only moderately so that the additional savings needed to replace diminished foreign capital flows would be forthcoming. `` There were few optimists about the prospects of meeting those lofty goals. But the facts now seem to indicate that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy is getting just that mix of growth.'' The big surprise, of course, is that things have gone as well as they have in the wake of the biggest stock market drop ever last Oct. 19. The collective vision of stock investors and traders is supposed to be pretty sharp. When the market takes a big dive, government policymakers, business planners and lots of other people pay close attention. But eight months after the fact, whatever calamity the crash might have been foretelling has yet to make its presence felt outside the securities industry itself. The manufacturing economy is enjoying a boom in exports, and consumers have n't gone into hiding. In fact, the passage of time has given increasing credence to the strange idea, first advanced by a few observers in the midst of the commotion in October, that the crash actually was a beneficial event in some significant ways. `` Economic performance during the first half of 1988 got a helping hand from the stock-market plunge last October,'' economists at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> say in a just-issued report. `` That event jolted financial markets, and the financial sector is still shaky. But the liquefication of financial markets that occurred after Oct. 19 and the resulting decline in interest rates supported real economic activity as 1988 began. `` Even though short-term rates are back to where they were in September 1987, interest-rate-sensitive sectors, particularly housing and consumer spending, are stronger than they would have been had rates not declined earlier.'' Do n't be fooled by all this, say the pessimists. If the alarms sounded by the crash for the federal budget and the machinery of the markets themselves continue to go unheeded, they warn, more big trouble is likely. What's more, they add, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s Law applies particularly when people get comfortable and complacent and think the times are going well. Still, it may be possible, without tempting fate, to add a new corollary to <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s Law for economic purposes: Every once in a while, unaccountably and when least expected, something will go right.

<DATELINE>CANUDOS, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This sleepy backlands town has hopes of becoming less poor than it is because historians have found a 19th century uprising here to be highly significant in the study of social dissent. Brazilians have come to call Canudos' uprising of 1897 a communist-style revolution 20 years before the Russians had theirs. But the Brazilian army and police crushed the uprising here with bloody force. An army of peasants led by a messianic preacher rose up against the government, the army and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. At least 15,000 rebels died in combat or were massacred by soldiers. Now historians and scientists from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> plan to restore part of the original peasant settlement and battleground and build a center to study the town's past and its place in the social history of the drought-plagued and impoverished Brazilian northeast. `` Canudos really scared <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, head of the history department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and a collaborator on the Canudos restoration project, said in a telephone interview. `` It awakened Brazilians to their own internal reality of backwardness and rural poverty and raised questions whether the country would advance. The modernist movement after 1910 had roots there.'' The restoration project calls for a 6,263-acre Canudos Park and possibly a `` living museum.'' Plans also call for a community action program to stimulate local arts and crafts and to improve health and education in one of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s poorest regions. `` This is important for us,'' said acting Mayor <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribeiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gama </PERSON>. `` We do n't have a lot except for our history. But almost anywhere you dig with a piece of stick you find bones.'' In the 1890s, <PERSON> Canudos </PERSON> was a farming colony that once supported 25,000 people. Today, it seems barely inhabitable. It is 1,200 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> on the edge of a region so desolate that it was for years a hideout for outlaws and, more recently, a proposed dump site for <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s nuclear waste. The main street is a dirt road that begins and ends ends where the town begins and ends, giving way to scrub-covered red plains stretching to the horizon. The nearest paved road is in <LOCATION> Uaua </LOCATION>, 32 miles away. Most of the town's 12,000 residents now raise goats or work on government projects during the chronic droughts of the Northeast. But on a rise overlooking the town is a reminder of its past: the bullet-riddled wooden cross erected by preacher <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conselheiro </PERSON> at the original settlement. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conselheiro </PERSON>, which means <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> the Counselor in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s Portuguese language, was a lawyer who roamed the wild northeastern interior, preaching frugality and chastity, before settling here in 1893. With a long gray beard and dark robes, he looked and sounded like a Biblical prophet. `` Folks used to call him ` the good <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>,''' recalled <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardoso </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, who says his age is something `` over 100'' and is by consensus the area's oldest living resident. `` I was just a boy of 10 at the time, but an uncle and a grandfather of mine left home to follow him.'' <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conselheiro </PERSON> set up a commune on an abandoned farm and established strict rules: no private property, no paper money, no outside work. Later he became more militant and preached tax revolt and civil disobedience. `` Some say he really was a land reformer or an early communist,'' archaeologist <PERSON> Yara </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Ataide </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the coordinator of the Canudos project, said in an interview in <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION>'s capital. Peasants came from miles around to follow the new messiah, and <PERSON> Canudos </PERSON> grew from a tiny hamlet to <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION>'s second largest community after <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> on the coast. But the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the government worried about <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON>'s growing influence, and the army was sent to break up his commune. However, the ill-equipped bands of peasants, fighting on terrain they knew well, ambushed and routed three army expeditions and <PERSON> Canudos </PERSON> became a national embarassment for the government. Finally, a fourth expedition of about 10,000 soldiers and police surrounded Canudos and decimated the settlement during a three-month siege. On Oct. 5, 1897, troops invaded the commune and slaughtered the final holdouts. `` My great-aunt was there and managed to escape. She used to tell us kids how the soldiers cut off heads and the blood ran ankle-deep in the streets,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, who runs the <ORGANIZATION> Brasil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> and boarding house in <LOCATION> Canudos </LOCATION>. Despite its impact, little has been written about the rebellion. Few outside of Latin American scholars know about the Canudos War. The best account was `` Rebellion in the Backlands'' by <PERSON> Euclydes </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunha </PERSON>, who covered the uprising as a reporter for the Brazilian newspaper O Estado de <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>. In 1984, the Peruvian novelist <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON> published `` The War of The End of the World'' based on the rebellion. But the government was less than eager to preserve the memory of <LOCATION> Canudos </LOCATION>. One reason was that the issues it raised _ land reform, rural guerrilla warfare, religious militants. `` Canudos became a model for social revolution and resistance to central authority,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Ataide </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. After the fighting, the settlement was burned and razed. Later a dam was built on the <LOCATION> Vaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> below <LOCATION> Canudos </LOCATION> and most of the commune was flooded by the reservoir it created. But the town's past wo n't go away. <PERSON> Luiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopes </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Magalhaes </PERSON>, a mapmaker with the historic project, walked through a seemingly trackless plain in the area known as the Valley of Death. He knelt by a ring of stones and pointed to a partly exposed skull, which had a jagged hole in the forehead. `` This probably was a soldier,'' he said. `` They came here after the ambush to be treated or die. There are rusty canteens and ammunition clips all around here.'' <PERSON> Magalhaes </PERSON> thinks <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conselheiro </PERSON> got a raw deal from history. `` They make him sound like a fanatic. But a lot of people here think he was just trying to help the poor,'' he said. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> maintains that portraying <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conselheiro </PERSON> as a communist or a land reformer misses the mark. `` He was more like an <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> or a <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION> _ an austere, devout, unworldly chaplain who tried to follow the precepts of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> by withdrawing from the world,'' he said. `` Canudos is important to understanding the background of social dissent. We need to study it in relation to other events in the world, like the rise of fundamentalism in the <LOCATION> Mid-East </LOCATION>.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Unhurriedly and with caution, determined to avoid the flaws that contributed to the Challenger disaster, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is moving toward the resumption of shuttle flights later this summer. This time a veteran shuttle pilot will be a launch czar and a host of other changes have been made in hardware and procedure to minimize risk.

 On that cold day, Jan. 28, 1986, any one of half a dozen officials, aware that the weather might be damaging, could have halted the launch of space shuttle Challenger. But none did, and 73 seconds after liftoff, the spaceship and its crew of seven were destroyed in a fiery explosion. Never again, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> says, will the launch decision be so flawed. The rules have been changed, and when Discovery resumes shuttle flights this summer, one man will have the authority to command a launch or to scrub it. He will look to many experts, analyzing every scrap of information, for help. But, in the end, the decision to launch will be his. That responsibility lies with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, a 50-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain who has gone into space more often on the shuttle than any other person. He piloted the very first mission in 1981 and since has commanded three other flights. `` I feel from my military training that there has to be one person in charge,'' <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> said. `` Somebody needed to sign on for it, and I'm willing to do it.'' His fellow astronauts are delighted to have one of their own calling that critical shot. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain, who will command Discovery on the first post-Challenger mission, said, `` I flew my first mission with him in 1983, and I ca n't think of anyone who has more of a broad, in-depth knowledge of the whole shuttle system. And he's a good thinker. So <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> is the right person to be there.'' Creation of a launch czar is just one of many changes introduced in the program as a result of the Challenger disaster. Many have been time-consuming and have led to delay after delay in getting the shuttle back into space. Some critics say <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has been too conservative, that it is delaying for any reason because it has lost the nerve to launch. Space agency officials heatedly deny this. `` The No. 1 priority for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space program is to get the shuttle flying again, but we'll not fly until we feel we are ready,'' said Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON>, associate administrator for space flight and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s highest shuttle program official. `` We'll never have a perfectly safe vehicle, but we'll have one we'll have confidence in. The most publicly visible shuttle changes have been in the overhaul of top <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> management. All involved in the Challenger launch decision have been replaced. The solid fuel booster rocket blamed for the accident has been redesigned. The <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that investigated the explosion for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the direct cause was a small leak in a joint between segments of one of Challenger's two booster rockets. Flames shot past two synthetic rubber O-rings and touched off the explosion of the huge fuel tank. The commission report said cold weather, 36 degrees at liftoff time, contributed by robbing the O-rings of their resiliency, preventing them from sealing the joint properly. Some booster engineers had argued against launching in the cold, but their concerns were blocked by lower level executives from reaching top managers. While the shuttle fleet has been grounded, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has made more than 80 modifications to the booster rockets and an additional 300 to shuttle systems and support equipment. The spaceship itself has undergone 210 changes, including improvements to the engines, structure, brakes and landing gear and installation of a blowout hatch to the crew cabin and a telescoping pole the astronauts could slide down in an emergency landing. `` That's a large number of changes, and we are treating the flight as a new test flight of a vehicle that's not quite the same,'' astronaut <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> said. Less visible are the changes in the approach to launching a shuttle. Items: _ <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON>, happy to have only one job, launch director, instead of the multiple jobs he held as director of shuttle operations during Challenger `` The launch decision process now is more formal, more crisp, and the responsibilities of the individuals are more well-defined,'' he says. _ <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kranz </PERSON>, director of shuttle mission operations at the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, overseeing an overhaul of flight design, planning and training procedures to correct deficiencies that had <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> `` struggling to meet an accelerating flight rate as our schedules were becoming unmanageable at the time of the accident. _ <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, chief of the shuttle flight directors' office in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, assembling a team of veterans to direct Discovery's return to flight, training a new generation for the higher flight rate ahead, and streamlining documentation, weather forecasting and other `` We are a lot more safety conscious,'' he says. Final preparation for liftoff begins about two weeks before the designated date when shuttle boss Truly convenes a flight readiness review at the Kennedy Space Center.

 The review, <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> said, will be much more thorough than those that preceded the last few shuttle launches. `` Because of the higher flight rate and other factors, we had diverged from the high level of detail that it had started out to be,'' he said. `` Following the review, we will end up with action items,'' he said. `` Some of these will be designated launch constraints, meaning they have to be corrected and closed out before we can fly. Two days before the planned launch, <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> will activate his newly created <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION>, a group of 20 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and contractor managers skilled in all elements of the shuttle system. `` We will look at all the changes that have occurred since the flight readiness review, and we will report on the closure of the launch constraint items,'' he said. `` We will start looking at things like weather. Out of this meeting will come a decision on whether or not to start the launch countdown.'' The management team will meet again the next day to review countdown progress and to decide whether to fuel the half-million-gallon external fuel tank. At three hours before liftoff, the members will settle before consoles in a glass-enclosed corner of the launch control center, three miles from the launch pad. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s leaders will assemble in another glass enclosure on the other side of the control center called the operations management room. Here will be people like administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, shuttle program director <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrich </PERSON>, Truly, field center directors, the agency safety director and others. The two groups will talk by intercom and telephone. In the past, the final OK to launch came from the senior management official present. He nodded assent based on the recommendation of the launch director. `` The operations management room will be a more businesslike place than we're used to,'' <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> said. `` In the past, you could say that if nobody showed up in that room, you could have gone ahead and launched, with the launch director making the decision. Now each person in that room, just like those on my <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION>, will have his own input into the launch decision. If anyone has a concern, he can bring it to me. The lines of communication will be open to everyone, anywhere in the system.'' Between the two glass cages, launch director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> and his launch controllers will be monitoring the countdown, in touch with the astronauts aboard the shuttle and with the flight control center in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> says it's a luxury to be the launch director alone and not have to be saddled with the multiple assignments he had previously as director of shuttle operations at the Kennedy Space Center. <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> emphasizes the main responsibility for the countdown lies with the <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> crew. `` They have pre-ordained ground rules and launch commit criteria, and we are there primarily to monitor and to handle the off-nominal occurrence, things that we were not smart enough to foresee,'' he said. A key moment will come at the nine-minute-before-liftoff mark in the count, when a planned hold will be called. At this point, <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> will poll the members of the launch team to determine if there are any problems. <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> will monitor, conduct his own poll, and then will make the decision whether to start the clock for the final count. `` The vote must be 100 percent or we wo n't go ahead,'' he said. <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said that during the Challenger count, the results of the poll, all positive, were relayed to the operations management room, and the senior official there, associate administrator <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, Truly's predecessor, said to proceed. He and others in the room did not know of the cold weather worries of the rocket engineers. `` As the launch team, we would look to that room,'' <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said. `` The program director was there, the associate administrator was there, the center directors were there. But it was not clear as to the focus of the responsibility. `` That should n't imply that the right discussions or the right communications did not occur. But it was n't specific, and one of the <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> commission findings and recommendations was to improve the launch decision process.'' Because of the Challenger accident and subsequent reviews of all systems, <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> and his team will have more systems and subsystems to monitor more closely during the countdown. `` We have added more launch commit criteria _ red lines, as we call them,'' <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said. `` We've added about 25 percent more instrumentation measurements. They're primarily in the high-energy systems, in the main engines, the auxiliary power units, the fuel cell system and in the reactants.'' Because of the performance of these systems over 25 shuttle launches, <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said he did not expect the extra monitoring to make a launch postponement more likely. But he said new weather restraints could cause delays. `` The weather criteria are more conservative,'' he said. `` Especially in the areas of potential severe weather and potential triggered lightning.'' As an example, when Challenger was launched, the rules said there could be no clouds or lightning within five miles of the launch pad or along the flight path. That circle has now been increased to 10 miles. Intitially, at least, there will be no launch in temperatures below 55 degrees.

 Visitors entering <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>'s office ca n't miss this sign: `` If it is n't safe, say so.'' As director of the Kennedy Space Center, <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> is overseeing the preparation of Discovery for the first post-Challenger space shuttle flight later this summer. The sign sums up his approach. If anyone, anywhere in the system, has a concern, that person should report it. `` I'd rather call a timeout to take a look at those concerns than to move on without checking thoroughly,'' <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I do n't want anyone on launch day to say, ` Is there something I overlooked, something I should have reported and did n't?' We want to be sure we have done everything humanly possible to make this vehicle as safe as it can be before it flies.'' Several workers have come forward with legitimate concerns. Other reports have proved unfounded, and have caused processing delays. <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> says he'd rather be safe than sorry. <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>, 57, was a lieutenant general in charge of the Air Force Space Division when <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> tapped him to be center director. He was part of the space agency overhaul after the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of space shuttle Challenger. He retired last year from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and continued in the job as a civilian. <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> has gained a reputation as a `` hands-on'' director who takes a personal interest in his 13,000 workers and the shuttle hardware that is checked out, assembled and readied for launch here. He pays close attention to the processing through daily staff meetings, weekly sessions with center managers and monthly conferences with key <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> shuttle officials. said. `` I also get out and talk with the people,'' <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> says. `` I want to know what they are thinking. Almost every day I personally check the hardware _ the orbiter, the solid rocket motors. If I get a free hour, I say it's time to go out and kick some tires, so I get in the car and go out there. `` The workers talk freely with me. They discuss a full spectrum of concerns, from processing concerns to work hours. They do n't feel intimidated It's a good repartee, and I feel good about it.'' When he first took over as director, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s target for resuming shuttle flights was February 1988. That date has slipped several months, and, while the delays have been frustrating, he says they have been necessary. <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> said the emphasis on quality and safety has created enormous paperwork, or flight documentation, as he calls it. `` We close out flight documentation in an orderly way,'' he said. `` We are not going to move hardware to the next station until it is ready. It's time-consuming, but, when in doubt, do n't. No one is in a hurry to make a mistake.''

 Democrats arriving at the nation's busiest airport for their quadrennial political binge will find the antebellum South not only gone with the wind but without the prospect of a sequel. Delegates looking for nostalgic flashbacks to crinoline petticoats and hoop skirts, moonlight and magnolias in modern <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> will just be whistling Dixie from memory and with no help at all from the convention podium. `` You wo n't hear Dixie and you wo n't see any Confederate flags at this convention,'' vows <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, a political science professor from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> who is the convention's chief executive officer. `` Today's <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> is a vibrant, dynamic city of the future, which makes it an ideal host for the party of the future.''

The <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> legislature put off until after the convention a battle over redesigning the state flag, now three-quarters occupied by the Confederate battle flag. While the chaos in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> at the'68 convention has not been entirely forgotten, the power structure in this Sun Belt city is n't greatly worried about unruly demonstrations when the convention is gaveled to order on July 18 `` We should n't have any trouble with demonstrations, mainly because everybody running this city has been organizing them for 20 years,'' allows <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, the super-cool chief salesman for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, who in that two decade-span has moved from the ranks of civil rights marchers outside city hall to the mayor's office inside.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s citrus groves, severely damaged by freezes in 1983 and 1985, have rebounded and near-record crops are expected this season. The problem is, sales of orange juice and grapefruit are on the decline, with many Americans turning to other juices, diluted products and soft drinks.

 Americans are losing their taste for orange juice and the demand for fresh grapefruit has soured at a time when the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> groves are laden with a bumper crop. And that has the billion-dollar <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus industry worried, worried enough to fight back with a proposed $ 72 million promotional campaign. For the first time since such statistics have been kept, retail sales of orange juice _ <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s premier citrus product _ have declined two years in a row. So has the demand for grapefruit juice, but that's not as serious since much less of the crop goes into juice. Orange juice is facing increased competition from other juices, diluted products and soft drinks, says <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Image makers have some concerns about fresh fruit, too. `` Fresh citrus products lack identity, especially fresh grapefruit,'' <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> recently. The department, charged with the promotion and marketing of the state's fresh and processed citrus products, is proposing some hard-hitting programs and increased budgets for the 1988-89 season. Merchandising and publicity campaigns are being mounted to try to convince people that orange juice is just as refreshing as any other beverage and probably much better for them. `` We want to maintain orange juice as the gold standard of juices,'' says the <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s marketing director, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. Surveys show that the orange juice market share dropped 6 percentage points from 1980 to 1987, while apple juice gained 6 points. Orange juice sales are at 59 percent of the juice market, with apple juice solidifying its hold on second place at 17 percent. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> expects to produce 140 million 90-pound boxes of oranges this season, 90 percent of which will go into processed juices. The current grapefruit crop is estimated at a near record 53 million 85-pound boxes, with production expected to soar to about 60 million boxes by the mid-1990s. Most of the state's export grapefruit is grown in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> section of the citrus belt. Excellent growing conditions -LRB- ample rainfall early in the season and mild winter weather -RRB- have resulted in outstanding crops since the 1983 and 1985 freezes, which devastated the northern sections of the citrus belt. `` There can be little doubt left that our industry is making a strong recovery from problems encountered earlier this decade,'' <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> says. The projected orange crop for this season would be the largest since the 1980-81 season, when 172 million boxes were picked. `` The fruit just kept right on growing,'' says <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, citrus statistician with the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. In the coming season, the department wants to spend $ 39.4 million to promote orange juice sales, a 17.3 percent hike over the current $ 33.6 million. The problem is rather more complicated with grapefruit, fresh or otherwise, since it is seen as dour and sour, an unglamorous sort of lump for today's life styles. A recent study shows that Americans have quit spooning up the tarty fresh fruit by almost two pounds per capita since the 1970s. Some say it is no longer trendy and that nutrition-conscious consumers have forgotten about it in favor of more glitzy _ and more heavily promoted _ products. <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> and his crew want to `` develop an image and identity'' for fresh grapefruit in the modern world, making it, in computer terms, more `` user friendly.'' About half of the grapefruit crop is sold as fresh fruit. For the even more difficult job of selling 100 percent-pure grapefruit juice, special TV commercials are being test-marketed in support of merchandising and public relations campaigns to explain the health benefits of grapefruit juice over other juices and beverages. The commercials emphasize the `` unique,'' `` clean-tasting'' and `` invigorating'' attributes of the juice and are aimed primarily at women 25-54, a category of steady users. The proposed budget for promoting processed grapefruit juice is $ 11.6 million, up 62.1 percent from the $ 7.2 million being spent this season. The department's proposed fresh fruit spending plan for 1988-89 is $ 21.7 million, an increase of 38.7 percent from the current $ 15.7 million. While the domestic demand for fresh <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grapefruit has declined, the export markets have expanded dramatically over the past two seasons and overseas shipments are expected to set records in volume and value this year. `` I've never seen the situation any better,'' says grower <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Titusville </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is by far the state's best grapefruit customer, importing almost 9 million cartons -LRB- about 42 pounds each -RRB- last season. State citrus officials are working closely with American trade representatives, trying to persuade <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to expand its quotas for the fruit. The <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also plans a stepped-up promotion campaign in other <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> countries and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Behr </PERSON>, state director of economic and market research, describes the problem this way: `` The question is whether we can respond to these increases in production, and help demand grow accordingly to absorb them.''

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dysart </PERSON>, the judicial patriarch on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,'' finds himself in a cliffhanger romance with a younger woman because of the writers strike. <PERSON> Dysart </PERSON>'s character, <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON>, has become the object of the affections of a somewhat aggressive third-year <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> law student. Had not the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> walked out on March 7, the romantic dilemma might have been resolved before the end of the season. But the strike forced `` L.A. Law'' to end the season without making its final two episodes. `` You can say <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> became the cliffhanger by chance,'' <PERSON> Dysart </PERSON> says. `` He was approached by this lovely young lady. She's a law student and the granddaughter of one of our clients.'' The young woman, played by <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Falcon Crest,'' is separated from <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON> by more than 30 years. `` I do n't know what's going to happen,'' <PERSON> Dysart </PERSON> says. `` The writers ca n't do anything because of the strike. I do n't know if she's coming back next season or if they'll just drop it.'' Clearly, <PERSON> Dysart </PERSON> is delighted that his character is involved in a romance, even a May-December one. Although the head of the law firm of <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brackman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kuzak </PERSON>, he has been somewhat of an enigma. His character has not yet been explored as deeply as some of the others. <PERSON> Dysart </PERSON>, who has a hearing problem, suggested that he wear his two hearing aids in a show in which he went into court in an age discrimination case. Since then, he wears the hearing aids in court. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuzak </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON>, is the only one in the law firm who knows about the hearing aids. The series is the first for <PERSON> Dysart </PERSON>, who has spent most of his career on the stage. On Broadway, he created the role of the coach in <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s Pulitzer Prize-winning play `` That Championship Season.'' He has also had parts in a number of movies, including the recent hit `` Wall Street.'' `` I was trying to make it by doing films and TV movies,'' he says. `` I suppose I hoped some day a good series script would come along. The odds against that are pretty high. I was overjoyed when this came about. I had no doubt that it would be successful. `` I heard about the show and asked my agent to get a script. After I read the script I called him and told him I wanted to talk to <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON>. My agent said, ` That's funny, he wants to talk to you.''' <PERSON> Dysart </PERSON> recently returned to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where his alma mater, <ORGANIZATION> Emerson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, awarded him an honorary doctor of laws degree. `` I earned my bachelor's and master's degrees,'' he says, `` so it was kind of them to give me an honorary degree.'' He also returned to his home in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to visit his ailing father and get in a few days of fishing. He got married last Labor Day to <PERSON> Katheryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobi </PERSON>, a figurative contemporary artist. He was married twice before and has no children. His new wife, a widow, has a 19-year-old son. She is currently illustrating a new book on <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>. `` She moved into my neighborhood and we have similar cars,'' <PERSON> Dysart </PERSON> says. `` One thing led to another. We became fast friends four years ago and got married a year ago.'' <PERSON> Dysart </PERSON> gave little thought to acting as he was growing up in the <LOCATION> Kennebec </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. He worked on the local radio station, but when he got to <LOCATION> Emerson </LOCATION> his interest changed to acting. Later, he spent four years in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, handling assignments for investigators with the Office of Special Investigations. He returned to <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> to get his master's, then headed for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Off-Broadway was just getting under way about that time,'' he says. `` I worked at the Circle in the Square Theater at <LOCATION> Sheridan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. We had a lot of good people there. I worked for many years off-Broadway and Broadway. `` In the 1960s I got interested in repertory theater and was one of the founding members of the American Conservatory Theater in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Actually, we founded it in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, but we moved to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in 1967.'' After a year in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> he returned to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to appear with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> in a revival of `` The Little Foxes.'' <PERSON> Dysart </PERSON> got his first movie role while in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> through his friendship with <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. The movie was `` Petulia'' in 1968. He also appeared with <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> in `` Hospital,'' `` Hindenburg,'' `` The Last Days of Gen. <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>,'' and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s television series `` East Side, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>.'' He played Gen. <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> in the <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> movie and in a <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> production called `` Churchill and the Generals.'' He plays President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> in the upcoming <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` War and Remembrance'' and in July will play <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> again in the CBS movie `` Day One.'' That film is about the making of the atomic bombs and the decision to drop them on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>.

 `` Godspell,'' the joyous little pop musical that put the Bible on Broadway, is back in town. The show, now playing at the Lamb's Theater, was directed by <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON> who has a long association with the hit musical. He played <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> for more than 1,000 performances during the show's seven-year run in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Godspell,'' based on the Gospel of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Matthew </LOCATION>, is one of those classic show business tales of success: Young man -LRB- <PERSON> John-Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tebelak </PERSON> -RRB- writes show as a master's project at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. Show gets done on a shoestring in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at a small experimental theater off-off-Broadway. Gets favorable reviews. A revised version, with new songs by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, opens at a larger off-Broadway theater and eventually makes its way to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. At one time during the 1970s, there were 30 companies of the musical playing around the world. <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON> first came to `` Godspell'' in 1972 at the age of 24. He starred as <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> company of the show and later came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for a two-year run. `` Finally, with shinsplints, a sprained ankle and nodes on my vocal chords, I gave up the ghost and left the show,'' <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON> says. `` After it had been running five years off-Broadway, I was asked to open up the Broadway company. `` I was flattered. So I wrapped ankles, visited the throat doctor and went on,'' says the director who started in show business at the age of 12 as an actor. Throughout its long run in the 1970s, `` Godspell,'' a gentle, free-spirited retelling of the last seven days of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, kept slowly changing. `` The show became a little bloated, and the simplicity disappeared,'' <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON> says. `` Unlike a regular show where someone directs it and the production stays that way, <PERSON> John-Michael </PERSON> -LRB- who died in 1985 -RRB- was basically the overseer of this troupe of lunatic actors who had come out of an improvisatory style. He encouraged the show to be flexible and free.'' <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON> agreed to direct the revival only after discussions with composer <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>. `` I wanted to stay true to the original intention of the show and still have the freedom to bring it up to date,'' he says. `` I wanted people to think they were watching the original, the show they remembered, even though it is n't.'' Besides changing the musical's prologue, <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON> updated a lot of other material in the show, particularly the jokes and political references. Now there are jokes about <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and the crisis in evangelism. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has also popped up, as has the ubiquitous yuppie. A section of the show that was spoken now has turned into a rap number. `` We've brought it up to the'80s,'' he says. `` Physically, it looks the same as it did when it first opened, but the idiom has been updated.'' For the revival, <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON> hired young actors who had never done `` Godspell'' before. Most had never seen it. He has also used some of their suggestions _ `` they are authentically young'' _ such as incorporating a Pee Wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> step into the choreography. He has taken some of their references and things that have come out of their current frame of mind to create the show. `` The things I've learned by playing <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, I've tried to pass along to <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Steefel </PERSON> who plays him in this show but without being dictatorial about it,'' <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON> says. `` Everybody else in the musical, I'll just give notes or suggestions. With him, I unconsciously start to act it out or show him and that's wrong. He is the actor.'' The original performers in `` Godspell'' all came out of <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>, now <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. They had been together for four years and had a strong background in an acting technique that involved story theater, the telling of stories and the playing of games. It's a technique not taught much lately, so <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON> asked for _ and got _ an extra week of rehearsal to do theater games such as <PERSON> Blindman </PERSON>, trust exercises and circle games with the new actors. They are exercises dedicated to creating an ensemble unit of actors and break down the social barriers. `` It's the only show in which you have to be deprogrammed when you leave it,'' <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON> laughs. The director feels the musical will find a new audience today, even though it has only been a decade since the show was last seen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, plus get many of the people who saw it before. `` I'm a'60s person,'' the 40-year-old <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON> says. `` We all thought we were searching for new definitions. We thought we were revolutionaries, either political or spiritual or whatever. But there was a spiritual search alive and a rejection of material values _ or at least we thought so. Then we entered the'80s and we've come into yuppie materialism.'' It was `` Godspell's'' naivete and honesty that attracted people in the 1970s, <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON> says, adding that the musical had a fresh perspective on something that had lost meaning for people _ the Gospel. `` I think we are in a crisis of values now,'' <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON> says. `` Everybody seems to be involved now in another search for meaning or a new search for spiritual values. It's the pendulum swinging, although it has n't swung yet. The kind of joy that ` Godspell' has, the kind of hope that ` Godspell' gives, that is needed. And I think people will come and find it as refreshing as they did before.''

 <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON>, a tiny 6-year-old with big brown saucers of eyes, cries in fear when he sees soldiers and often hides in the orphanage where he lives. <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON>, 16, is the most aggressive child at another children's home and `` capable of breaking anything when he's angry,'' says the home's director Angel, a Salvadoran boy about 14, saw his mother killed in the guerrilla war and ended up on the <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> streets sniffing paint thinner. On a wooded hillside in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, a slightly-built, baby-faced boy who uses the nom de guerre `` William'' has an M-16 slung over his shoulder. Now 15, he says he has been a guerrilla fighter for a year and a half. All are survivors and victims of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s armed conflicts. `` The children who have seen violence, even if they have n't been direct victims in terms of physical violence, will keep the trauma of the effect of war for a long time. This can last for a lifetime,'' said <PERSON> Agop </PERSON> <PERSON> Kayayan </PERSON>, representative at the Central American headquarters in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> UNICEF </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund. `` We're really talking about the way the next generation is going to act or is going to think of the way things are done in society.'' Few statistics are available to show how many children have been killed, wounded or orphaned by eight years of war between leftist rebels and the U.S.-backed government in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, by the fighting for the better part of 10 years in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and by the still-simmering 27-year conflict between leftist guerrillas and the army in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, 40,000 children were orphaned _ the loss of one or both parents _ in the 1978-79 Sandinista revolution that ended 42 years of <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> family rule. An additional 11,361 children have been orphaned in the more than six years of fighting between U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels and Sandinista-government troops. Children form a large part, from 60 to 80 percent by some estimates, of the more than 1 million people displaced in their own countries. Thousands of others are among those who have fled to neighboring countries, or to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. A Guatemalan court survey found more than 58,693 orphans as of August 1986. But only 55 percent of Guatemalan towns responded to the survey and the total number of orphans is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000. The Salvadoran government agency charged with children's welfare has no figures on the number of orphans in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Throughout the region, but particularly in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> where half the population is Indian, many orphans are taken in by relatives. Others, like <PERSON> Angel </PERSON>, the Salvadoran boy now in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, fend for themselves. Young teen-agers fight on both sides of the conflicts _ for guerrillas or for governments. <PERSON> Lino </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Trigueros </PERSON>, executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, said the commission has found 12 - and 13-year-olds with the military on the remote <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast Military service is required for those 17 to 25. Reporters have seen children as young as 13 in the Contra rebel ranks. In the Salvadoran countryside, it is easy to spot children who appear years shy of the 18-year draft age with the army, as well as with the guerrillas, like `` <PERSON> William </PERSON>.'' Where clashes are frequent, casings of spent bullets often become the only toys children have play with. The trauma of living with war, in crowded refugee camps or in constant flight, has many faces. `` This can be seeing security forces as people who are going to kill or hurt rather than as security forces,'' said <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>'s Kayayan Seeing families, relatives or neighbors killed can lead young people to be violent themselves, he said. The effect multiplies with the closeness of the relationship and the degree of violence. A drawing by a third-grade Guatemalan refugee girl at a camp in southern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> shows soldiers shooting men tied to stakes. Decapitated bodies lie between them. Orphanage personnel asked that children's names be changed for this article to avoid reprisals against them.

When soldiers came to his village late last year, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> fell to the ground and covered himself with pine boughs. His father and the group of women the boy was with escaped, but <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> was discovered and wound up in the orphanage. `` When he saw the little girls at the home he said he did n't like women because they had abandoned him,'' the orphanage woman said When she took him to look for relatives among other displaced people, she added, `` he would n't go in because he saw the soldiers.''

 Sixteen-year-old <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> has told the director of the orphanage where he has lived for five years that soldiers broke his father's fingers and tortured him in other ways `` to make him confess that he was a guerrilla. `` They shot him three times in the chest,'' the director said. `` He never saw his mother again.

One day he began telling <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> about nightmares he has of seeing his mother killed at their home in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` He vividly recalled to me the killing of his father, mother and two brothers,'' he said. The next day, soldiers found the boy asleep at home and brought his little sister and him to a base where his brother was a soldier. `` Soldiers came back to the base one day and said his brother had been killed. Then soldiers, friends of his or his brother's, took them to the border and told them to go across,'' he said. Shortly after arriving in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, he lost track of his sister. One day, the director says, <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> wants to go back to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to find a younger brother. He has been in and out of a home run by a religious group in the provinces.

 In many children, the trauma is hidden. `` What you can say is that there have been many learning difficulties, many difficulties in relating,'' said <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Dagnino </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Enfants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION>, a private French organization that works with refugee children in several countries. Parents who are refugees become depressed, have no jobs, lose their traditional contact with the land. The child, in addition to having to leave his home, loses his father image. `` They have lost all points of reference,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dagnino </PERSON> said. A woman who works with refugee orphans said she had `` several children who go around setting fire to everything.'' But while children in orphanages often fight with each other, she said these do n't. `` It is as if they protect each other,'' she said. Perhaps worse than the direct effects, says <PERSON> Kayayan </PERSON>, is the money that military spending takes away from health, education and other programs to help children and the destruction of those facilities. Adding to the problem is economic crisis in the already-poor region from both the wars and other factors. <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> says infant and child deaths are on the rise in the region and nearly two out of three of the survivors suffer some degree of malnutrition. A study by the Guatemala-based <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> found the nutrition in rural communities of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> had worsened significantly between 1985 and 1987, a period after the most recent peak in fighting. `` In the war atmosphere of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> it is impossible to collect data,'' the institute's Dr. <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON> said. `` But it is reasonable to think that with the military and economic situations, there is a worsening in the state of health.'' About 40 percent of children under age 5 in the Central American region are believed to suffer some form of malnutrition. The average includes <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where conditions traditionally are better. In 1980, 64 percent of the population was below the poverty line and 41 percent could not afford the minimum food basket. But <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON> said worsening nutrition levels or infant and child mortality were `` like the tip of the iceberg,'' the culmination of a series of changes such as more illness or reduced physical activity. `` It may be that it is not as important as all the change that occurs, what that implies in all the children who did n't die,'' he said.

 On the uninhabited <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> island of Fassa off <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, the trees began to shrivel. When the government of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> nation investigated, it found the problem was 15,000 metric tons of unspecified toxic ash shipped from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, that had been dumped by a Norwegian company on the island. <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>'s government in <LOCATION> Conakry </LOCATION> arrested <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s honorary consul general, <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Strome </PERSON>, on a charge of complicity in the dumping. The Guineans cracked down on toxic waste after seeing <PERSON> Fassa </PERSON>'s trees shrivel, but the prospect of multi-million dollar paydays is luring an increasing number of African countries into becoming dumpsites for millions of tons of toxic waste from industrialized Western countries In <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>'s case, <PERSON> Aluco-Guinea </PERSON>, a government-controlled company, signed a contract to accept 85,000 metric tons of waste at $ 50 a ton. The government canceled the deal in April and demanded that the waste on <PERSON> Fassa </PERSON> be returned to the country of origin. The government also arrested several of <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> employees who granted import licenses for the waste. <PERSON> Strome </PERSON>, the honorary consul general, has no formal diplomatic status, the Norwegian government said in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, and was employed by <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s Klaveness shipping group, which engaged the vessels for the waste shipments to <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestesulen </PERSON>, a Klaveness spokesman, described the waste as slag ash and denied it was toxic. `` The content of toxics are well below approved <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> levels,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> case nevertheless stirred concern in neighboring <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries. `` It does n't matter what amount of money they are offered,'' said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sey </PERSON> of The <LOCATION> Gambia </LOCATION>. `` You do n't know, but you mortgage the entire history of your people. `` You liberate your countries from colonialism and you talk about imperialism, apartheid. But what is more horrible than dumping nuclear and toxic waste?'' Sey said The <LOCATION> Gambia </LOCATION>, a country about the size of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and sandwiched like a sausage by <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, has been approached by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French companies who wanted a site to dump toxic wastes. `` They have been offering handsome rewards, a lot of money is involved,'' <PERSON> Sey </PERSON> said. `` We are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars. The <LOCATION> Gambia </LOCATION> is a very poor country, but I do n't think any amount of money would lead us to agree to mortgage the future of our countries.'' According to government officials and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNEP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, nearly a dozen <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries either have signed or are negotiating contracts to accept industrial wastes or have been approached. Led by <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has been unusually candid about the problem, calling names and pointing fingers. `` We heard that <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION> had been considering accepting nuclear wastes from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and on hearing this, we sent a delegation to the Republic of <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION>,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nwachukwu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We were told that they had been approached, but that they had turned it down and would not allow any dumping.'' <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> itself has not escaped the problem, however. The government announced June 11 that preliminary tests of waste secretly dumped in eastern Nigerian by an Italian company show the substances to be poisonous. Scientists urged that anyone who visited the dump site to undergo medical tests. The government also said it had seized an Italian ship in <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> harbor and ordered it to take the wastes back to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. A government spokesman, <PERSON> Yusufu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamman </PERSON>, said some Nigerians and Italians had been arrested for the dumping, but he did not identify them. He told reporters five shipments of waste had been brought to <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> since Aug. 26, 1987, with the latest arriving May 20. The shipments totaled 4,766 tons, of which about 2,000 had actually be dumped, he said. Earlier, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s Guardian newspaper reported that 10 European companies covertly dumped in the country more than 20 of the world's most dangerous industrial toxic wastes, including radioactive materials. The newspaper said the wastes has been brought in falsely under a permit granted by the government for the import of chemicals for construction projects. It added that the wastes, dumped near an oil terminal at <LOCATION> Forcados </LOCATION>, 150 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION>, included such poisonous materials as melamine wastes from <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and polyurethanes and ethyl acetate formaldehyde from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. While few African countries talk openly of their involvement in dumping, they are not ignoring the problem. In late May, the government of the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> announced the arrests of five people, including an adviser to the prime minister, in what became known as `` the industrial waste affair.'' Political adviser <PERSON> Dieudonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganga </PERSON>, environment director <PERSON> Marius </PERSON> <PERSON> Issanga </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamissimi </PERSON>, external trade director <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tchicou </PERSON>, lawyer <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON> and artisan <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Passi </PERSON> were accused of establishing a fictious company with the intent of covertly accepting toxic wastes. <PERSON> Ganga </PERSON> purportedly initiated contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>'s capital, on a plan for the <ORGANIZATION> Congolese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to stock 1 million metric tons of industrial waste. The company would have earned $ 4.2 million a year under a three-year contract, the government said. Officials said the five `` had admitted their guilt.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> has not commented on the affair. Prodded by <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, the Oganization of African Unity -LRB- OAU -RRB-, at its recent silver jubilee summit session, adopted a resolution condemning the dumping of industrial wastes in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, calling the practice `` a crime against <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the African peoples.'' Barely a week later, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, unanimously adopted a resolution banning large-scale exports of toxic waste from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to Third World countries.

 Despite the public pronouncements, few expect any quick resolution of the problem. `` Quite a lot of the business is going on somewhere in the twilight,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Huismans </PERSON>, director of the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Potentionally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toxic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of <ORGANIZATION> UNEP </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think it is economics. I ca n't see any other benefit of receiving this waste.'' Money also is a factor for Western industries, which account for the bulk of the 300 million metric tons of industrial wastes produced annually worldwide. Stringent environmental laws in the West, like those imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, demand on-site disposal facilities that can cost as much as $ 30 million and take years to build. And to ship toxic wastes from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ which churns out 10 million metric tons of wastes a year _ across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to a landfill in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> costs about $ 800 a barrel. Industrialized countries also are under public pressure to keep toxic landfills away from rapidly expanding residential areas. In return for $ 92.6 million, the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, a nation of 1.8 million people, agreed to accept 1 million metric tons for storage or incineration over eight years. The `` heavily polluted chemical waste,'' as it was described, was to be shippped from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belguim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Santen </PERSON>, the Rottendam-based cargo firm hired to transport the wastes, made no effort to conceal the deal. T.H. <PERSON> Looyschelder </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santen </ORGANIZATION>, said the firm saw a double advantage of transporting toxic waste to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Not only do we have a cheap way of disposing of waste, but the Third World will be provided with money, knowhow and infrastructure,'' he was quoted as saying. The company said similar negotiations were under way with <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>, in north-central <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Santen </PERSON> was forced to put the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> deal on hold after a spate of negative publicity. `` Before the transports to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would take place, we would have taken samples and analyses of the chemicals involved to check whether the transports would be within the regulations of the various countries involved,'' <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Hulswit </PERSON>, deputy director of <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santen </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. `` But now that the press has painted the picture of us being involved in illegal activities by imposing dangerous materials on Third World countries against their will, we're bowing out.'' <PERSON> Huismans </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official, said <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries are n't prepared to handle the West's toxic wastes `` In principal, there is nothing terribly wrong with dumping toxic wastes in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> providing the receiving countries can properly handle the wastes,'' he said. `` Invariably, most of the countries who accept the wastes are importing a problem that they initially may not know is a problem.'' <PERSON> Huismans </PERSON>, a toxicologist, said that most hazardous wastes shipped to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are so vaguely described that it is impossible to know from their names whether they are dangerous or not. Parts of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> long have been toxic wastes dumps. As those landfills became full, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> became the new dumping ground beginning five years ago. <ORGANIZATION> UNEP </ORGANIZATION> has drafted a Global Convention on the <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transboundary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movements </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hazardous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wastes </ORGANIZATION>, which was discussed an an international toxic waste conference sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> UNEP </ORGANIZATION> June 6-10 in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNEP </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director, <PERSON> Mostafa </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolba </PERSON>, said it would be legally binding on signatory nations once approved by the 50-nation group, probably next year. `` Most of the countries are not equipped to handle such imports,'' <PERSON> Tolba </PERSON> said in a statement. `` That's why we must work to get the international treaty into force to ensure adequate control of movements of hazardous wastes crossing frontiers. ... `` We have received information on planned exports of millions of metric tons of hazardous wastes from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to Third World countries such as <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bissau </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Huismans </PERSON> urged preventative work on possible health hazards. `` I do n't think we should wait until such proof is found,'' he said. `` So far, it has been difficult to prove that any wastes have led to serious effects on human health. But it takes time for these things to develop.'' Said Sey, the Gambian foreign minister: `` I think people have a concept that <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is the jungle. `` If you can not dump it in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, just dump it in the jungle because it is just trees and animals and those Africans do n't matter.''

<DATELINE>GENOA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While most chemical or industrial waste finds a final resting place, some goes off on long, circuitous journeys to nowhere. That's what happened with 2,100 metric tons of wastes stored in 12,000 drums from an Italian chemical company in February, 1987. Fifteen months later it is back in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> aboard what Italians call the `` ship of poison.'' The waste was first loaded aboard a Maltese freighter at the port of <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> di </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carrara </LOCATION>, about 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Genoa </LOCATION>, and sent to tiny <LOCATION> Djibouti </LOCATION> in northeast <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Djibouti </LOCATION>'s authorities turned it away. The vessel then took the cargo almost half a world away to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, where it was unloaded. But people there protested and authorities ordered the waste removed. It was put aboard a Cypriot freighter and taken to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, after the ship was turned away by <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. Syrian authorities inspected the cargo, said it might contain radioactivity and ordered it back to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, its place of origin. The Syrian freighter <LOCATION> Zanoobia </LOCATION> _ now, the `` ship of poison'' to Italians _ took it to <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> di <PERSON> Carrara </PERSON>. The Zanoobia anchored off the port for a month and five crewmen fell ill after having lived with the cargo for four months. They were taken to a hospital but released after treatment of ailments not further detailed. Italian officials then allowed the <LOCATION> Zanoobia </LOCATION> to dock May 29 in <LOCATION> Genoa </LOCATION>, where another crewmen was hospitalized after complaining of nausea and abdominal pains. The Zanoobia remains in <LOCATION> Genoa </LOCATION> while Italian authorities decide when and how to remove its cargo and where to dispose of it in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. It the meantime, health officials test the air and water around the vessel to be sure it does not contaminate the area. They said they have not found any evidence of radioactivity in the cargo, but they still are not sure exactly what the chemicals are. The Italian government has appropriated $ 3.3 million for the disposal but said the money would have to be repaid by Jelly Wax, the company in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> that contracted to dispose of the chemicals in the first place.

 A key turning point was <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s dramatic call in January 1986 for the global elimination of all nuclear weapons by the year 2000, including a first-phase scrapping of INF missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by 1990. Ten months later, at a meeting in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, he and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agreed in principle to eliminate all but 100 INF missiles on each side. They also came close to agreeing in principle to scrap all ballistic missiles, a idea that went far beyond the INF proposals and triggered an avalanche of West European complaints that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had gone too far. Although the West Europeans at that point were pressing hard for completion of an INF treaty, the <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> talk of eliminating all ballistic missiles caused a serious political crisis in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. The Europeans felt they had not been adequately consulted by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on an issue that directly affected Western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s security Shortly after that summit, <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, then premier of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, called on the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies to create a new security charter to defend their interests. `` The scope of the proposals put forward by both sides at the <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> summit in October seemed to shake the very basis on which our conception of U.S.-Soviet relations is founded,'' <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> said. His remark carried with it the weight of broad agreement among the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies that they should insist on playing a bigger political role. `` One can not remain forever a spectator to the American-Soviet negotiations, even if they are positive,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Filipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> told the French mewspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published Feb. 11. This concern is rooted partly in the allies' belief that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is losing some of its international political predominance and that economic strains induced by years of huge budget deficits may soon force it to pull some American troops out of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a feeling has grown in recent years that the Europeans are bearing too small a share of the burden of Western defense. In June 1984 the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, by a 55-41 vote, defeated a proposal to withdraw nearly one-third of the 326,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> unless the allies did more to improve non-nuclear defenses. This triggered a new effort in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, spearheaded by <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> and former a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Abshire </PERSON>, to cooperate more on defense planning and in the development, production and buying of armaments. A key result of this was the Conventional Defense Improvements initiative approved at a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers meeting in May 1985. Talk of strengthening the `` European pillar'' of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has been around since President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> coined the term in 1962. But it has taken on added urgency in recent years, partly due to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic problems. A study by political leaders and defense experts from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and eight European <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries, published in May, called for a high-level alliance meeting early in 1989 to revise the trans-Atlantic pact on which Western security has rested for 39 years. `` A fundamental change has occurred in the U.S.-European relationship,'' the study concluded. It said the Europeans should take more of the economic and political burdens of alliance leadership, and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should accustom itself to conducting <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> business on more even terms with the Europeans. As perceptions about the military threat posed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have changed in recent years, trans-Atlantic friction has grown over how to respond to security problems outside the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> area. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in April 1986 brought this conflict to a peak. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was the only <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> country to explicitly support the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing raid, which was described by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a defensive response to Libyan backing for terrorist attacks on Americans in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The French and Spanish governments declined to permit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-111 fighter-bombers to cross their airspace en route from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and back. <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> says this marked the low point of his four years at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was quite nasty,'' he said. `` It brought to a head the American perception that the Europeans were really not interested in anything that happened outside the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> area.'' It also hardened a West European view of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as a group of `` cowboys,'' <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> said. The strains eased over time, helped by the decision of several <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries, including <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, to join the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in mine-clearing operations in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> starting in 1987.

 <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Horsford </PERSON> has turned a supporting role as <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON>, the unmarried, 39-year-old deacon's daughter on `` Amen,'' into one of the most popular characters on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> hit comedy. <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON>, who's been engaged and jilted 18 times, has been described as a `` vampy virgin.'' <PERSON> Horsford </PERSON> said in an interview that she sees <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON> as a reluctant spinster who, even at 39, is still holding on to her virtue. `` It's always a challenge to a man to be first,'' she said. `` Do n't ever assume that virtuous girls are uninteresting.'' <PERSON> Horsford </PERSON> was born and raised in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, the daughter of a businessman, and attended <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s High School for the Performing Arts. She said she began to draw up a history for <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON> as soon as she was cast. `` She's unemployed, unmarried and living at home with her father -LRB- played by <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemsley </PERSON> -RRB-,'' she said. `` I wrote it all down. Then I could see what's my attitude toward someone like that. My first reaction was that she was spoiled by her father. She does n't do what she does n't have to do `` I looked for her endearing qualities, too. She'd been engaged many times, so I looked back in my past at the girls who got the ring but never got to the altar. I created a woman who is quiet, strong, manipulative and secure in the sense that her life has been consistent since childhood.'' If Daddy spoils her, it's the handsome Rev. <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who puts her in a matrimonial mood. So far, her love is unrequited. Before `` Amen,'' <PERSON> Horsford </PERSON> worked regularly in films, including `` St. Elmo's Fire,'' `` Heartburn,'' `` Class,'' `` Crackers,'' `` The Fan'' and `` Street Smart,'' plus in a number of television movies. `` I've played a lot of strong women in films,'' she said. `` Sometimes I've been a policewoman and carried a gun. But I really hate guns and abhor screen violence. My father was shot by a holdup man when I was 4, and thereafter he wore a gun to work. I never dated in high school. All the boys knew <PERSON> Daddy </PERSON> carried a gun.'' She said in her screen roles she has tried to portray strength through her presence. `` I think a character who can scare you with his presence is much stronger than a person who needs a gun,'' she said. `` I try to show that in my acting.'' Because of the regularity of her work in movies, she said she was n't terribly worried about whether she would land the role in the network series. She had tested for the role in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, then was called to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to test opposite <PERSON> Hemsley </PERSON>. `` I came out on a Sunday, auditioned on Monday and was told there'd probably be a decision on Tuesday. Well, there was no word on Tuesday. Or Wednesday or Thursday. By then I was back in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. My agent called me at noon Friday and said, ` Guess what? You have the job.''' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had made a reservation for her on a 4 p.m. plane that day. `` I said, ` Oh, no, is this the way <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> does it?' I flew back to <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> and went to work the next day.'' <PERSON> Horsford </PERSON> said she has learned that in television you have to come out ready, with all your lines memorized. `` I said I'm so grateful for every lesson, for every showcase I've done,'' she said. `` You do a sitcom and you can use everything you've learned. You do n't have time to think of criticism because it's so fast. I think what makes a hit show is an actor giving a lot of his or her resource to a writer. `` A producer hires you hoping that you can deliver. But there's no way a producer can anticipate how the audience will respond to you The writers pick up little pieces of you and your personality and put it into the script. An actor's heartache is having a great line but then losing it because it did n't work in rehearsal. In television, if something does n't work the first time there's no second chance.'' When she moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> two years ago to start work on `` Amen,'' she found herself facing another problem. She had to learn to drive. `` I'm an expert now,'' she said. `` I went to driving school for seven weeks. When I first came here I got very friendly with everyone at <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>. You get humble and ask everybody for a ride. I still have a soft spot in my heart, too, for all the men who let me drive and sat in the passenger seat while I was learning.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Big''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 There's a scene in `` Big'' in which <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> finds a giant piano in the F.A.O. <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> toy store in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON>, who is really a 12-year-old in an adult's body, begins dancing over the keys to pick out a tune. Along comes his boss, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Loggia </PERSON>, president of a toy company. The pair tap out a joyful rendition of `` Chopsticks'' and `` Heart and Soul'' with all the airy grace of <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> and Ginger. The sequence is one of the many delights of `` Big,'' which defies the odds by scoring a home run despite being the fourth comedy within a year about a boy who turns into a man. It is the most thoroughly enjoyable comedy since `` Tootsie.'' Unlike the earlier films, there's no sci-fi hocus pocus about `` Big.'' <PERSON> Josh </PERSON> <PERSON> Baskin </PERSON> -LRB- David <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> -RRB- is an undersized pre-teener who gets pushed around by bullies and is turned away from an amusement park thrill ride because of his size. Before a simple-looking fortune machine, <PERSON> Zoltan </PERSON> <PERSON> Speaks </PERSON>! he wishes to be big. The next morning he is. His mother is terrified to find this adult stranger in her house. <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> flees to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, holes up in a fleabag hotel where he contemplates his predicament with his pal <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Jared </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushton </PERSON> -RRB-, the only one who knows about the transformation. <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> finds work in a toy company and, with his acute knowledge of what kids like, ascends to an important position. He encounters a predatory female -LRB- <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> -RRB- and a vengeful executive -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heard </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, but he manages to elude both. Then <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> is moved by <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON>' innate sweetness, and a romance of sorts ensues. Ending `` Big'' must have posed a problem for writers <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, who also co-produced. Should <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> remain an adult and continue the romance and career? Or should he return as a boy to his grieving family? The conclusion is totally satisfactory, though getting there has some rough spots. The plot inconsistencies are overbalanced by an absolutely stunning performance by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON>. Using only body language and quirky expressions, he is irresistible as the boy-man. If the Academy ever recognizes comedy as a worthy achievement, <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> should be rewarded. After a shaky start with `` Jumpin' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Flash </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> breaks through as a comedy director of rare skill. All of the performers are topnotch, especially the ever-faithful <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Loggia </PERSON> and youngsters <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Rushton </PERSON>. A 20th Century Fox release also produced by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenhut </PERSON>, `` Big'' is rated PG, but it seems like ideal summer entertainment for the entire family.

 `` Orphans'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>, VHS-Beta: $ 79.95, Rated R -RRB- The comical mugging that opens the 1987 film `` Orphans'' indicates the dark humor to follow, but does nothing to prepare you for the flip side _ the frightened, frightening relationship between the hotheaded mugger and his younger brother, orphans who keep out the world in a big decaying house in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The actors in <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pakula </PERSON>'s movie _ <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Modine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> _ turn out stunning performances in a play-like movie based on <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>'s award-winning stage drama. The older brother -LRB- <PERSON> Modine </PERSON> -RRB- builds a cocoon, venturing out to make a living mugging and stealing and virtually imprisoning his brother -LRB- <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> -RRB- by telling him he will have an allergic reaction and die if he goes outdoors. Into their violent, unreal world comes a staggeringly drunk gangster on the run -LRB- <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> -RRB-, himself an orphan and able in a flash to dissect the complicated relationship he finds in the brothers' littered house The story is implausible but it does n't matter much as you watch what inevitably follows the disarming gangster's intrusion into the orphans' lives. <PERSON> Modine </PERSON>'s character, who believes he's abducted the gangster and intends to hold him for ransom, sums it up when he says, `` He's taking over. ... He's supposed to be a kidnap victim.'' _ By <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> MacVean </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Prick Up Your Ears'' -LRB- Virgin Vision, VHS-Beta: $ 79.95, Rated R -RRB- A story of talent and torment, `` Prick Up Your Ears'' tells the real-life story of British playwright <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Orton </PERSON>'s rise from a working class background, to the heights of success, to a brutal end. <PERSON> Orton </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldman </PERSON> -RRB- was a raw talent with a lust for life who studied drama in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. There, he met <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Halliwell </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON> -RRB-, a more cultured writer who becomes his homosexual lover. The two lead a closet existence before they're jailed in different prisons for defacing library books. <PERSON> Orton </PERSON> uses the separation to grow on his own, becoming one of the brightest talents in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> after his release. His career skyrockets when he connects with high-powered agent <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsay </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> -RRB-. She nurtures his talents, arranging for him to meet <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> for a screenplay about The Beatles. Success drives the wedge deeper between <PERSON> Orton </PERSON> and his jealous roommate, <PERSON> Halliwell </PERSON>, a psychotic whose mother died of a wasp sting when he was a child and whose father committed suicide. <PERSON> Halliwell </PERSON> is being left behind, covering his disappointment as clumsily as he covers his bald head with an ill-fitting wig. The emotions boil over to dark rage. To make sure he does n't lose his lover, <PERSON> Halliwell </PERSON> hammers him to death in a grisly scene, then takes his own life. The 111-minute video is rated R, mainly for homosexual love scenes and shadowy men's room sex. _ By <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dvorchak </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> National Writer.

 `` Wall Street'' -LRB- CBS-Fox, VHS-Beta: $ 89.98, Rated R -RRB- When `` Wall Street'' hit movie theaters last year, the real street was crashing and high-rolling traders such as <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> were being marched to prison. Anyone who thinks this movie offers any real insight into the quirks and greed that make stock market life so enticing will be disappointed. One of the many implausible aspects of this film written and directed by <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> is that there is n't a single decent woman's role. It could be that the film is implicitly blaming testosterone for Wall Street's vices. But who cares? This movie is great silly fun, fueled by superb acting from Oscar winner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, father and son <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Holbrook </PERSON> and <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Stamp </PERSON>. There's even a terrific walk-on by <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> as a pushy East Side real estate saleswoman. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> is suitably sinister as <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gekko </PERSON>, Wall Street dealmaker, dream-weaver and crusher of innocent companies. The younger <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, a young <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Glick-type </PERSON> broker who sees <PERSON> Gekko </PERSON> as his ticket to the big bucks. He will do anything to get into <PERSON> Gekko </PERSON>'s empire of beautiful women, limousines, cocaine and mega-deals. While at <PERSON> Gekko </PERSON>'s beach house he meets a beautiful but vacuous interior decorator played -LRB- <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> -RRB- who has big money dreams of her own. <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>, it turns out, is not her strong suit _ nor are brains. <PERSON> Gekko </PERSON> spins out such wisdom as `` greed is good,'' and `` every battle is won before it is fought.'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> ingratiates himself to <PERSON> Gekko </PERSON> by becoming a corporate spy and feeding him insider information. But when he finds himself embroiled in a take-over scheme that threatens to break up the airline for which his father works, this proves too much even for the avaricious young <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. _ By <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitgang </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

<HEAD>In the Groove: Dylan Reviewed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
. `` Down in the Groove'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> <PERSON> Columbia </PERSON> proclaims on the packaging of <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>'s latest album that he is a `` 1988 Rock & amp; Roll Hall of Fame Inductee.'' Did they think someone out there would pick up the record and say, `` I never heard of this guy, but look, he's in the Rock' n' Roll Hall of Fame How bad can he be?'' Most anyone browsing in the <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> section is going to be aware that his most recent `` Knocked Out Loaded'' was pretty mediocre and that even the darkly brilliant `` Empire Burlesque'' that preceded it was an acquired taste. <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> needs a strong, accessible back-to-basics record. `` Down in the Groove'' is it _ with an asterisk. <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> wrote only four of the 10 songs, two of which were co-written with the Grateful Dead's <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>. The Dylan songs are superb, and covers suit him so well, they might as well be his. The record is so strong because he has n't insisted on filling it with his own material, however weak. Instead, he offers unique Dylanesque treatments of standards including, believe it or not, `` Shenandoah.'' He's also backed by an all-star lineup of pals, including <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Clapton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Knopfler </PERSON>, the Grateful Dead, <ORGANIZATION> Full </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simonon </PERSON> of The Clash, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of the Sex Pistols, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> and Clydie and <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. Perhaps the best cut on the album is `` Silvio,'' one of the Dylan-Hunter collaborations, with <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Weir </PERSON> and Brent Mydland singing backup. The other Dylan-Hunter tune, `` Ugliest Girl in the World,'' shows our man's sense of humor intact: `` The woman I love, she got ta hook in her nose, her eyebrows meet and she wears second-hand clothes, she speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop, I do n't know why I love her, but I just ca n't stop.'' `` Had a Dream About You Baby'' is fine hard rock, one of two original songs <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> wrote for his movie, `` Hearts of Fire,'' which has not been released, though the soundtrack album is available. `` Down in the Groove'' opens with <PERSON> Wilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s `` Let's Stick Together. `` When Did You Leave Heaven'' is a crooner's number, and <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>'s strained wail is downright charming `` Death Is Not the End'' is the other <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> original, gospel tinged with a <ORGANIZATION> Celtic </ORGANIZATION> dirge. He closes with the <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>' haunting ballad of alienation, `` Rank Strangers to Me'': `` I wandered again to my home in the mountains, where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free. I looked for my friends, but I never could find them. I found they were all rank strangers to me.''

<HEAD>Star Watch: Stardom Eludes Tom Skerritt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 How can a serious actor such as <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Skerritt </PERSON> hold his own amid the pyrotechnics of `` Poltergeist III''? `` You do n't even try in a special effects picture,'' he admits. `` ` Aliens' had the same feeling. You simply do them to learn from the filmmaker. What you get out of it is to learn about lenses, how to use the camera effectively, some of the tricks of the trade. `` I'm more interested in being a director and in learning about that process than in being an actor in front of a camera. It's not a very exciting thing being an actor in front of a camera.'' His attitude may help explain the <PERSON> Skerritt </PERSON> film career. He seems always to be working, but he has never ascended to superstardom. He and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> made their film debuts in the 1962 `` War Hunt.'' <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> became an instant star; <PERSON> Skerritt </PERSON> did n't. In 1970, <PERSON> Skerritt </PERSON> appeared with <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> in the landmark comedy `` M-A-S-H.'' While his co-stars went on to fame and fortune, <PERSON> Skerritt </PERSON> turned up in films such as `` Run Run Joe'' and `` Big Bad Mama. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bancroft </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON> won Academy Award nominations for `` The Turning Point'' in 1977. <PERSON> Skerritt </PERSON> as <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON>'s compassionate husband did not. Again with the recent megahit `` Top Gun,'' <PERSON> Skerritt </PERSON> drew little credit for his powerful presence as <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON>'s flight instructor. If such happenstances bother <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Skerritt </PERSON>, he does n't show it. He continues taking jobs that interest him, ranging from guest appearances on `` Cheers'' to uncredited modeling of Guess clothes in magazines. The other day he was working on location at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> in a farce called `` Hunchback.'' It was originally titled `` The Hunchback of <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>,'' but that university declined to be associated. <PERSON> Skerritt </PERSON> is a newcomer to <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Poltergeist'' series, playing the role of the late <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>'s uncle. He confesses he has n't seen the first two films. He did n't have any qualms about joining in the middle of the series. `` I had a lot of confidence in the director, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>,'' he said. `` Generally, filmmaking is a matter of working with people whose work you enjoy enough to learn from. He had mounds of sketches of the way he was going to shoot the picture, all live special effects. I thought, ` This guy is an architectural genius.' Indeed, he had studied at architecture school in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Skerritt </PERSON> still has n't reconciled himself to the loss of <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>, the young star of all three `` Poltergeists.'' `` She was an extraordinary person _ very intelligent, very together, very focused young lady,'' he remarked, eyes misting. <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> died on the operating table Feb. 2 at <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> during intestinal surgery to relieve a congenital bowel obstruction. She had completed filming of Poltergeist III last June. A <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> native, <PERSON> Skerritt </PERSON> fell into acting at <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and moved west to study at the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> film school. `` I never really took acting seriously,'' he admitted. `` I was more interested in the process of making films. I did acting because I enjoyed it and found it therapeutic. But I also felt the responsibility that if I was going to direct or write I should certainly know how to act; it's an economy, a shorthand that you learn by doing. I fell into making a living at it.'' <PERSON> Skerritt </PERSON>'s career has taken a number of wrong turns. After `` M-A-S-H,'' he was offered a role in a proposed TV series based on the film. He declined, figuring it would be `` just another sitcom.'' Then his agents persuaded him to move to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, since <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON> had achieved stardom there. <PERSON> Skerritt </PERSON> stayed 3 -LCB- years, but the same lightning failed to strike. In recent times he has appeared in such fleeting films as `` Silence of the North,'' `` Space Camp'' and `` Maid to Order.'' But a `` Top Gun'' can offset such misses. `` I read 15 pages of that script and I wanted to do it,'' the actor said. `` There was no doubt of its power in terms of commercial appeal. With <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> directing and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruckheimer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> producing, there was no way that was going to be anything but a terrific piece of film.'' Out of `` Top Gun'' came <PERSON> Skerritt </PERSON>'s debut as a fashion model. The Guess jeans people called him for a magazine layout, and he joined up. `` To tell the truth, I do n't pay much attention,'' he commented. `` When people come up to me and say, ` My God, you've been in every magazine, every periodical,' I have no idea. I read Time magazine, the Wall Street Journal and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, and raise my kids and mow the lawn, pretty much. `` That's No. 1, is n't it: You father children and you raise them. You do n't run from the responsibility, as so many men seem to do nowadays. I do n't conceptualize this business as anything other than the way I make a living to feed my family and pay the rent. It's just a job.''

<HEAD>The Artists: The Endangered Euphonium and Other Instruments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE LLOYD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Know anyone who plays the euphonium? When was the last time you picked up your bassoon and blew a bouncy tune? The euphonium, a brass-wind instrument with a mellow tone, and the bassoon, a woodwind instrument with a long, curved stem, are among some less popular instruments some musicologists fear may become as endangered as the whooping crane. In an effort to reverse this trend, the <ORGANIZATION> Settlement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> is encouraging its students to play lesser-known instruments. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Capanna </PERSON>, the executive director of the school, said the number of students playing such endangered instruments as the euphonium, bassoon, cello, double bass, harp, oboe, trombone, tuba, viola, French horn and organ is declining. He is concerned about the trend and said he wonders what the professional implications could be if it is not changed. <PERSON> Capanna </PERSON> noted there is intense competition for positions in orchestras. However, if more interest in some instruments is not developed, that competition could wane. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Demkee </PERSON>, associate conductor of the <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, symphony and the orchestra director at <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said the quality of the performers is still high, but there could be concern if fewer people study some instruments. `` The people that are auditioning seem to be more prepared than ever,'' he said. However, the number of bassoon players at the high school, for example, has dropped from five to one over the last several years. Schools across the country are reporting the same trend as the <ORGANIZATION> Settlement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Capanna </PERSON> said. He attributed the swing in interest to cuts in school music programs. `` Kids at an early age are not getting that exposure -LRB- of different instruments -RRB-,'' he explained. Settlement offers a class called `` Meet the Instruments of the Orchestra,'' and provides scholarships for students to play such `` endangered instruments'' as the euphonium, a tenor tuba. `` Kids who are interested in music have a narrow frame of interest,'' <PERSON> Capanna </PERSON> said, adding that piano and violin are, by far, the most popular instruments being studied. `` We want to make kids aware that there are other instruments.'' Piano students are now encouraged to also take up the organ, and violinists are also steered toward learning how to play the viola. Settlement sponsored a program in which it distributed 120,000 comic books and tapes to schoolchildren called `` Quadrus and Friends Musical Journey.'' The books and tapes attempted to make children aware of how music touches their lives, and how they can become involved in music if they have the desire. `` The idea was to get kids to recognize ... there were people involved in good music,'' <PERSON> Capanna </PERSON> said. The school of 6,000 students, aged 3 to adult, is the largest community arts school in the nation. It was founded 80 years ago. The executive director said the enrollment has changed over the last decade. Ten years ago, <PERSON> Capanna </PERSON> said, 25 percent of the students played wind and brass instruments, the typical `` band instruments,'' such as clarinet, flute, trumpet and the endangered instruments. Now, he said, 13 percent of the enrollment are studying those instruments. He estimated that another 50 percent of the students are playing the piano, and the remainder are studying voice or playing string instruments, mainly the violin. `` In the long run, it will level out,'' <PERSON> Demkee </PERSON> said, noting that some students will change over to the more needed instruments. A lack of interest in some instruments can affect other music students, <PERSON> Capanna </PERSON> said. Because so many people are playing the piano and violin, their musical experience wo n't be as rich. There are limits to what the two instruments can play together and playing with a group of people enrichs a student's experience, he said. When the student is part of an audience for a musical performance, his or her appreciation will be greater if his or her musical experience is deeper, <PERSON> Capanna </PERSON> said. The popularity of the <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> method of teaching the violin also has shifted interest to the instrument, he said. The <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> method was developed by a doctor in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> about 20 years ago and is a way of teaching youngsters how to play the violin before they're even able to read music. Therefore, the child is already playing the violin before he knows the other options available. The method has since been applied to other instruments.

 Please, whatever you do, do n't ever tell <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayne </PERSON> she reminds you of <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> or Tiffany or <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. That would only ruffle those rock' n' roll feathers. `` The obvious reason for comparison is that we all came out at about the same time. The comparison, as far as I'm concerned, stops there,'' <PERSON> Dayne </PERSON> says. `` <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> is <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayne </PERSON> is <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayne </PERSON>. `` There is space for everyone but you have to be good,'' she said while in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to shoot a video for `` I'll Always Love You,'' a sentimental ballad off her debut album for <ORGANIZATION> Arista </ORGANIZATION>. With two recent hit singles from her LP, `` <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayne </PERSON>, Tell It to My Heart,'' two videos and another in the making, the 25-year-old performer says the only direction for her now is up. `` I always knew I wanted to be a star,'' she said. `` I do n't like the word ` success' _ it's phony and materialistic You end up summarizing your life in one word.'' She sighed and a big smile crossed her face. `` I'm happy,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayne </PERSON>, Tell It to My Heart'' recently went gold with sales of more than 500,000 units. In the music industry, that's considered pretty good for a debut LP The album includes a collection of dance songs, love songs and remakes, all in the rhythm and blues style with which <PERSON> Dayne </PERSON> flavors most of her music. `` My biggest influence was the radio. I've always liked blues-oriented rock,'' said the singer, who grew up loving the music of the <ORGANIZATION> Allman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> and Bad Company. `` ` Upon the Journey's End' is one of my favorites on the album,'' <PERSON> Dayne </PERSON> said. It's a romantic duet with <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. The catchier tunes on the album include the dance-tempo `` In the Darkness,'' an update of `` Want Ads,'' a hit made famous by the female soul vocal trio Honeycone in the 1960s, and a new version of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasley </PERSON>'s `` Where Does That Boy Hang Out.'' <PERSON> Dayne </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Baldwin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, made her debut when she was 16 years old at a high school dance with a band she and her friends had put together. While majoring in music at <ORGANIZATION> Nassau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, she joined a band called Felony. She spent nearly two years with them, quit and joined a pop-new wave band called The Next as lead singer. She stayed with them for about two years before deciding to go solo. `` I'm so glad I'm not where I was a year ago,'' <PERSON> Dayne </PERSON> said, as she recalled the days when she sang Russian Gypsy songs at a dinner club in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> With the lyrics written out phonetically, she could memorize them in a night. `` I do have a lot of friends and memories from there. I also understand a lot of Russian now.'' `` Tell It to My Heart,'' a dance-tempo single which <PERSON> Dayne </PERSON> produced with <PERSON> Ric </PERSON> <PERSON> Wake </PERSON>, quickly climbed to the Top 10 on the charts. That was just before <ORGANIZATION> Arista </ORGANIZATION> picked her up with an option for an album and then released her next hit single, `` Prove Your Love,'' which climbed to the Top 20 on the singles charts. <PERSON> Dayne </PERSON> travels a lot these days. She jets between <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where she has gained in popularity, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> where she still lives on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Accompanying her on each trip is <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON>, her Yorkshire Terrier. `` He comes with me everywhere,'' <PERSON> Dayne </PERSON> said, `` absolutely everywhere.''

While she moves ahead in her career at a hectic pace, <PERSON> Dayne </PERSON> said she does n't have time for a serious relationship. `` My music and my career just took over; I had to put my feelings on hold,'' she said. `` I get lonely sometimes but I have my music, my friends and my dog to keep me company. I guess I'm just waiting for someone to sweep me off my feet.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Reynolds Price Resurrects Rosa and Wesley</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Reynolds Price is a great believer in the power of the unconscious, so when two characters he introduced to readers a quarter-century ago rooted themselves in his imagination he put away his novel-in-progress and let them take over. The result is `` Good Hearts'' -LRB- Atheneum, $ 18.95 -RRB-, in which we catch up on the story of <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Beavers </PERSON>, the central characters of Price's first novel, `` A Long and Happy Life.'' In the 1962 work, <PERSON> Rosacoke </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustian </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Wesley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beavers </ORGANIZATION> crossed the line from innocence to adulthood in an isolated patch of rural <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. In the newest work they are married, middle-aged and entrenched in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, she working as a college secretary and he as an auto mechanic. Price, probably best known for `` <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaiden </PERSON>,'' his 1986 novel that won the National Book Critics' Circle award for best work of fiction, was asked in a recent interview why he resurrected these characters after so long an absence. `` I tried to start a novel about someone else, and this idea kept coming forward to my mind as I was making notes for another subject, and it seemed to be wise to go ahead and obey the impulse,'' he said. It was n't as if the characters had been living in his head growing old with him, he explained: `` Normally when I finish any given book I really sort of erase them in the computer, let that file go. But who knows what the unconscious mind is doing all that time. `` I think an enormous amount of my work is done by that part of my mind, and I would think that most of the creative writers that I know _ as well as a great deal of the scientific community _ find that a lot of their work is done by a part of their brain over which they have very little control.'' Price, 55, is the author of seven novels and 10 other books, including an impressive collection of essays, `` A Common Room,'' published last year. Except for a few years as a Rhodes Scholar in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, he has lived all of his life in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Like <PERSON> Eudora </PERSON> <PERSON> Welty </PERSON> and <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, two writers he greatly admires, Price has enjoyed staying put, teaching at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION> and writing about the kind of people he knows intimately. `` Good Hearts'' opens with <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> fleeing his marriage in what amounts to a midlife crisis _ if the term can be used without derision _ and a tragic event that befalls <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> as a consequence. The story is told from many characters' points of view, although <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON>'s presence dominates due to her tough-mindedness and a kind of radiance that Price bestows upon her. The idea of marriage as a sacred bond resounds throughout the novel, a belief Price says he shares with his characters. `` As a basically religious person, I myself feel certain kinds of human commitments _ matrimonial commitments, parental commitments _ do indeed have a kind of sacred force to them and are broken or maligned at a very serious risk to the person who does it.'' Despite some dark moments, `` Good Hearts'' ends with a sense of optimism and promise, a trait common to many of Price's works. The author was asked if that is a conscious goal on his part. `` I think it's probably emotionally characteristic of the kind of person I am,'' he said. `` I'm someone who _ with a normal number of exceptions _ who's had a very lucky and a very happy life till now. So I do n't tend to assume the worst about things. `` I'm also someone who feels that it's one of the goals of a work of art to assist people onward in the world. If what you've got to say really is that we should all get on the window ledge, slit our wrists and fall eight floors, I do n't see much point in saying that That's not an errand worth doing, in my opinion.'' Price's `` normal number of exceptions'' to his happy life includes being stricken by astrocytoma, a cancerous nerve tumor in his spinal cord that has left him a paraplegic since 1984. He said that being confined to a wheelchair has at least had the advantage of allowing him more time to write. `` One of the major things it's taught me to be is very, very patient. When your legs are paralyzed you've either got to get very able to sit still and do things slowly and gradually and accept an awful lot of tiny frustrations, or else you're going to go crazy fast.'' He joked that cocktail parties are difficult because `` you're sitting there like a potted plant and the most boring person in the world corners you and you ca n't excuse yourself to go get an hors d'oeuvre. Hypnosis lessons he began taking for pain control led him to explore memory regression with his therapist, which in turn led to his latest project _ a book of memoirs `` looking at the major emotional figures in my childhood and early youth.'' Eventually he hopes to get back to that novel that <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> chased away. But he'll let his unconscious dictate when.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Marty Robbins' Home Video Released</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than five years after his death, country music star <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> is on home video as a singing cowboy roaming the West, armed with a guitar rather than a pistol. `` The Drifter'' is rare footage shot in 1965 and 1966 that <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> hoped to use in a television show. Since it was done in black and white, the program was never sold because color had just revolutionized the industry. `` The show has previously been aired in only a couple of test markets,'' said <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' son, <PERSON> Ronny </PERSON>, who is overseeing the mail-order marketing of the video for <ORGANIZATION> Marty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robbins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>. `` The fact that they were shot in black and white only adds to their uniqueness.'' <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> laced much of his music with a macho western feel before he died of cardiac arrest on Dec. 8, 1982, at age 57. His best known song was `` El Paso,'' a gunfighter ballad in 1959 that earned him a Grammy Award. It is one of several tunes he sings in the video. During his 30-year career, he wrote some 500 songs and had 18 No. 1 hits. Among them were `` My Woman, My Woman, My Wife,'' `` Devil Woman,'' `` A White Sport Coat -LRB- and a Pink Carnation -RRB-,'' `` <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' `` The Hanging Tree,'' `` Some Memories Just Wo n't Die,'' `` Among My Souvenirs'' and `` Singing the Blues. Some 30 of <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' 101 albums are still available. `` There was n't any kind of country song he could n't sing and did n't have a hit with,'' said <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>, a researcher at the Country Music Foundation. `` He did cowboy songs, Hawaiian songs, calypso songs. He did love ballads, he did rockabilly in the'50s and then did the <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, the smoother style in the late'60s and early'70s.'' `` I think his versatility was responsible for the longevity of his career,'' <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON> said. `` He very successfully went with trends and set trends.'' <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> performed on the Grand Ole Opry from 1953 until his death almost 30 years later. A friendly, gregarious entertainer, he bantered with the audience and often stayed at the Grand Ole Opry House after the show ended to sign autographs for as long as an hour. `` He was a fan's favorite,'' <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON> recalled about <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' appearances on the Opry `` He always got encores right up to the end. The fans loved him.'' <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> sang the title song to the <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> movie, `` Honky Tonk Man,'' which was released two weeks after <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> died. He also appeared in 18 low-budget movies and sang the theme for others, such as `` The Alamo'' and `` The Hanging Tree.'' The sandy-haired, mustachioed performer was chosen for induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame two months before his death. Two other members, <PERSON> Tex </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Grandpa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, appear with him on `` The Drifter.'' Among the songs performed on the video are `` <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>,'' `` Cool Water,'' `` Tumblin' Tumbleweed,'' `` Streets of <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>'' and `` <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ronny </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> found the video material in a <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> bank vault after the bank kept sending bills for the storage. `` They were in three big vaudeville-looking chests,'' he said. `` There was not even any dust on them. The seal was totally intact. It was like I opened a time capsule; it looked like they had just been put in there yesterday. `` Daddy used to talk about the video market and how big it would be. I did n't have the foresight to believe what he was talking about. He was right; everyone has a VCR now. I think that's why he stored them.'' The younger <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> recalled that his father, who grew up in the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> area, was always captivated by the old West. `` I think he was a link with the past he wanted to be a part of. He was such a big fan of <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Autry </PERSON>'s. This was part of his life and this was his way to preserve part of it. `` His grandfather was a quote-unquote <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Ranger, a poet, a medicine man. He looks like <PERSON> Buffalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, a caricature of the West. It ingrained the early West in him. And being from the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> area in the 1930s, it was like the West. `` We'd drive home for Christmas and we'd get in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and he'd start singing songs You could see him lighting up and looking around. He loved the mountains and the desert.'' <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON> says there's no country singer today as versatile as <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> was. `` I do n't see anybody like him now,'' he said. `` There are popular singers, but they draw from one or two styles and go with that. In his time, <PERSON> Red </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> -LRB- who died in 1968 -RRB- was about that versatile. But I ca n't think of anyone today that way.''

 When <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> suffered whiplash in an auto accident 20 years ago, the last thing she considered was going to a chiropractor. `` My grandfather was an orthopedic surgeon,'' says <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, 53. `` The only thing I ever heard was, ` Stay away from them.''' But reinjury of her neck nine years ago led to severe headaches, neck spasms and faulty reflexes. Visits to an orthopedist, a neurosurgeon and her family doctor provided no relief. Finally, despite her reservations and her husband's opinion that chiropractic was `` hocus pocus,'' <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> sought the help of a chiropractor. The results have been `` darn near miraculous,'' she says. `` No pain, no headaches, full functioning.'' Others who have found relief, including athletes like runner <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> and tennis star <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON>, echo <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>'s glowing review. And physicians are reluctant to criticize chiropractic after four chiropractors won an antitrust lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. But the profession still struggles for credibility. `` We still meet lots of prejudices and unfair treatment,'' says <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, past director of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiropractic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The four chiropractors filed suit against the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> and other groups 11 years ago, alleging they conspired to destroy the chiropractic profession. A federal judge agreed in September and forbade the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> from discouraging members from associating with chiropractors. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> is appealing the ruling. `` I see a lot of patients that deal with chiropractors, and generally they are not accepted very well by the general medical community, but they do help a lot of people,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, a neurologist specializing in headache treatments in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Northbrook </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidell </PERSON> were the only two physicians willing to comment out of a dozen orthopedists and neurologists contacted in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area. Doctors at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and Rush-Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> declined comment, as did the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthopedic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgeons </ORGANIZATION> `` It's my feeling there are chiropractors who totally abuse what they're doing, but on the other hand, I've worked with chiropractors who are totally honest and who are doing a perfectly reasonable job.'' said <PERSON> Sidell </PERSON>, an orthopedic surgeon. It has been only 15 years since an <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> official called chiropractors `` rabid dogs and killers'' in the midst of a systematic campaign by the nation's largest organization of doctors to squelch chiropractic. Yet chiropractic is thriving. The number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> practitioners grew from 13,000 in 1970 to more than 30,000 in 1985, the last year for which figures are available, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiropractic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Chiropractic, derived from Greek words meaning `` effective hand,'' is based on the theory that disease may be caused by interference with nerve function, which practitioners try to correct by manipulating the spine and other joints. Chiropractors differ from physicians in that they perform no surgery and prescribe no drugs, preferring to let the body try to heal itself after full nerve function is restored. It is 93 years since Canadian immigrant <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> `` D.D.'' <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> cured the deafness of his janitor in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> by manipulating his spine. His experience with the janitor, who had become deaf after wrenching his back, led to <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>'s development of chiropractic principles and establishment of the first school to teach them in <LOCATION> Davenport </LOCATION> in 1898. There are now 15 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chiropractic colleges accredited by the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiropractic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. Students must complete 4,200 classroom hours of medical education over four years, similar to medical school. The curriculum includes anatomy, physiology, nutrition, pathology, public health, clinical and laboratory diagnosis, gynecology, obstetrics, pediatrics, X-ray technique and interpretation, geriatrics, psychology and ethics. `` The standards are getting greater each year,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, vice president for academic affiars at <ORGANIZATION> Logan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiropractic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. To be accepted into an accredited chiropractic school, students generally must have a `` C'' average in two years of undergraduate study, including biology, chemistry and physics. Far from the stereotype of the medical school dropout, chiropractic students are more typically people who have already established credentials in nursing, physical therapy, teaching and dentistry, <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said. `` Twenty-two percent of students have master's degrees or better.'' <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> said stories abound about chiropractic's efficacy, `` from wonderful miracle cures to horrible tortures.'' `` Fortunately, it's not like that,'' he said during a radio interview in Liberty, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where he practices. `` Most people have an idea that we just work on backs and that we pop necks or pop backs ... But our main emphasis is to check out the overall integrity of the structural parts of the body.'' Treatment may relieve conditions ranging from constipation to work-related injuries to sciatica, a low-back pain that shoots into the leg, and scoliosis, a sideways curvature of the spine, he said. Chiropractic is trying to gain credibility with something it has never had: scientific proof of its effectiveness, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolk </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiropractic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The lack of research arises from `` a fundamental problem of funding,'' he said. <PERSON> Wolk </PERSON> said mainstream medical research has been financially supported largely by the federal government and pharmaceutical companies _ neither of which has had any interest in exploring chiropractic. To fill the void, the foundation has earmarked $ 5 million over the next six years to commission independent research into two areas where chiropractic seems to hold the most promise: low back pain and headache. Until large clinical studies can be done, patients will have to rely on their own best judgment about disagreements over chiropractic that prevail in the medical community and about the varying skill levels among chiropractors. As Chicago-area sports trainer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gajda </PERSON> told Tennis magazine, `` You have 64 percent that tend to be average, and you have 10 percent that tend to be geniuses, and then you have the lower end of the spectrum that should be shot in front of a Mexican jail.''

 From an abandoned blimp base, scientists are peering beyond the stars and studying how the earth moves.

They also found that the generally stable <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area is rising a fraction of an inch a year. On the grounds of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Observatory's <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> station south of here are optical and radio telescopes, a visiting German laser system and soon a gravity meter, all designed to pinpoint locations and distances. `` We're observing continental drift, changes in the earth's crust and movements along fault lines, as well as the earth's spin and wobble,'' says <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON>, one of 10 civilians at the station and its director `` As far as I know, this network is the only source of such measurements.'' The station, which costs less than $ 500,000 a year to run, is part of a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> network used by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other satellite-launching nations to program guidance systems and pinpoint locations. The data is being fed into a growing worldwide satellite network that will become the definitive source for navigators. It is not only available to ships, planes, satellites and submarines, but to motorists via computerized maps. `` I met a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> taxi driver who had a receiver mounted in his cab _ he said it was quicker and more accurate than using a map,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON>. There are even hand-held receivers can pinpoint location and headings for hikers, explorers and rescue teams. <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, set up in 1949 at a World War II blimp base, also has the only backup to the Master Clock at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a basis for accurate time measurement all over the world. The cesium-fueled clocks at <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, which measure time by the radioactive element's rate of decay, are checked constantly against those in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to prevent errors. The exact time is shared with other points by bouncing the information off satellites. Even at the speed of light, phone lines are useless for comparing the readings because switching stations can slow the signals. However most of the staff's time is spent looking upward. The 60-foot diameter radiotelescope seeks out quasars, small sources of intense radio emissions billions of light-years away at the edge of the visible universe. `` If one of them seems to be moving, we know it's really the earth that's wobbling,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON>. The measurements are constantly checked and rechecked to see how the earth and points on its surface are changing. In addition, researchers from the Wettzell Station in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are using a mobile laser telescope to fire green light beams at a two-foot orbiting LAGEOS satellite covered with 40 four-inch mirrors. The beam bounces 3,500 miles back to show up on a screen in a trailer crammed with electronic equipment. `` You can do a lot of things with this information. It's a very accurate position fix for a satellite, or for points on earth,'' says German scientist <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Etling </PERSON>. Distances over 1,000 miles can be calculated to within an inch or two using this method, he says. The Richmond scientists plan to install by year's end a gravity meter, a metal ball suspended in a magnetic field that can measure minute changes in mass below it. And Ms. <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON> hopes to install a laser system that can bounce beams off mirrors left on the lunar surface by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet moonwalkers. The new systems may eventually have to replace the observatory's optical telescope, which will become as useless as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s when encroaching development lights up the night skies and makes stargazing Ms. <PERSON> Babcock </PERSON> has no doubt ever more exotic measuring sticks will be available. `` In this field, the technology is changing so fast we never really get to a standard system.''

<HEAD>Arteries May Produce Signals Leading To Clogged Arteries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The deposits that clog the body's arteries, contributing to heart disease and other problems, may result in part from hormones produced by the arteries themselves, new research suggests. `` Our results illustrate that the cells of the blood vessel wall are not mere bystanders in disease of the blood vessel wall but can play an active role by secreting important hormones,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Libby </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Deposits on the artery walls contribute to heart attacks, high blood pressure and other circulatory problems. These deposits, known as plaque, are made of fat as well as overgrowth of smooth muscle cells. The new research shows that muscle cells taken from plaques produce a powerful hormone, platelet-derived growth factor, that stimulates the muscle cells to grow. If so, arteries may become clogged because their cells are both producing this hormone and responding to it by growing. Why is still unclear. Platelet-derived growth factor was first isolated from platelets, blood cells that help to form clots. However, research has shown that other cells can also make this hormone. The study, reported in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, was conducted on cells in test tubes. Researchers say cells in the body may act differently.

 Fetal brain tissue implanted in two Swedish Parkinson's disease patients appears healthy six months after surgery, and a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> researcher says that may signal new hope for sufferers of the disease. The two transplants are believed to be the first monitored closely enough to produce scientifically reliable results, said Dr. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffer </PERSON>, professor of pharmacology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and part of an international team responsible for the clinical trials. <PERSON> Hoffer </PERSON> said it's too soon to tell if the tissue transplanted late last year will produce noticeable improvement in the recipients, two middle-aged women in advanced stages of the neurological disorder that affects 500,000 Americans. Parkinson's is a progressive destruction of nerve cells. Victims suffer tremors and increasing muscle stiffness until they can not move normally. In the experimental therapy, a small cluster of brain tissue is removed from an aborted fetus and injected into the patient near the base of the brain. In animals, the fetal cells develop into nerve cells that produce dopamine, a central nervous system transmitter that Parkinson's disease patients lack. The use of fetal tissue has sparked controversy in anti-abortion circles.

<HEAD>Researchers Closing In On Alcoholism Gene</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers say they're on the trail of a gene that could lead to a blood test to identify people vulnerable to alcoholism. A study of 30 families, each with at least two alcoholic male siblings, showed a possible link between alcoholism and the MNS blood group, a genetic marker determining blood type, says <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Clinic. `` Eventually, we may be able to screen people and tell them how great their risk is of being an alcoholic,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> says. Among members of any one family, the alcoholics' MNS blood group had similarities not apparent among the blood group in the non-alcoholics, she says. `` We do n't know what the gene is. It could be a gene that affects the way people react to alcohol, the way the brain reacts. It could be a gene that's important in developing a compulsive personality.'' Research points to the existence of such a gene, but not its location. Studies show that children of alcoholics face four times the risk of becoming alcoholics themselves, even when separated from the alcoholic parents at birth and adopted by a non-alcoholic mother and father, Ms. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> says. The findings are to be published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members have recessed their midyear conference until Tuesday so the 13-nation cartel's oil ministers could informally discuss disagreements over a proposed new quota in production. The conference opened Saturday and was recessed after Sunday's meeting until Tuesday morning Afterwards, two Arab oil ministers left, with one expected to return by Tuesday but the other saying he might not. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ministers have been considering whether to change an existing agreement among 12 of the members that limits the cartel's oil output to 15.06 million barrels a day. That quota, which was extended in December and expires June 30, was aimed at supporting oil prices at $ 18 a barrel but prices have been well below that.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> moved toward tightening the requirements for deciding whether mutual funds can describe themselves as `` no-load'' funds. In no-load funds, which many investors prefer, no sales fee is charged. But, since 1980, no-load funds have been allowed to use some of the money from investors to pay for certain sales and promotional expenses. The commission voted 4-0 Friday to ask for comment on a proposal that would tighten regulation of how these expenses are assessed against mutual funds. It would also prohibit funds that assess these hidden charges from describing themselves as no-load funds.

 Still pictures and written words may capture high school and college graduates' best memories but a video yearbook is what's needed to really go beyond the sounds of silence, students and industry executives say. `` There are a number of pitches we use,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitan </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, N.C.-based Yearbook Enterprises. `` It brings those black and white photos to life by capturing the excitement and emotion that a print yearbook ca n't always do.'' <PERSON> Levitan </PERSON> said his company, like others in the field, do n't try to undercut sales of the traditional yearbook but offer the video as a supplement. Videos cost between $ 20 and $ 40 depending on their length, which can range from 30 minutes to 90 minutes. A yearbook, which must go to print midway through the second half of the school year, can not always include things like senior prom and graduation. <ORGANIZATION> Yearbook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> works with about 50 colleges and high schools in teaching students how to use video equipment and buying the rights to songs that young filmmakers want to use as background music. `` It's educational,'' said <PERSON> Levitan </PERSON>, who filmed <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s yearbook for two years before graduating in 1983 `` Students grew up watching <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>. This is an opportunity to create with video. They're creating their own MTV.'' One student attracted by the idea was <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zager </PERSON>, an 18-year-old senior at <LOCATION> Lawrenceville </LOCATION> Prep. He has coordinated filming and sales of his school's video yearbook, which sells for $ 39.95, for the past two years. He said sales expanded this year because more students became aware of a video's knack to recapture the feeling of student plays and homecoming football games. `` There's something about sitting down and watching events in color,'' said <PERSON> Zager </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>. `` It gives you an honest sense of the school.'' <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> junior <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Havens </PERSON>, who worked on her school's 30-minute video, agreed `` This is a more living type of yearbook,'' said the 20-year junior from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` We do n't try to downplay -LRB- traditional -RRB- yearbooks but this is a lot more lively.'' The video yearbook companies take different approaches. At Campus Camera, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> company co-founded by two former cameramen from an <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> television station, the philosophy is `` leave the filmmaking to us.'' `` Our quality of equipment is equivalent to a TV station,'' co-owner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pashuck </PERSON> said. `` I would n't hand that over to a student.'' <PERSON> Pashuck </PERSON> said students also might tend to only film their friends. Outside cameramen prevent that and guarantee a quality product. And <PERSON> Pashuck </PERSON> and his partner have enjoyed their first year with the two schools _ <ORGANIZATION> Mainland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Linwood </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION> _ that they've worked with. <PERSON> Pashuck </PERSON> said Campus Camera, like other video yearbook enterprises, will grow in the years ahead by capitalizing on people's expanding familiarity with video equipment. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, the 30-year-old head of Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yearbook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the job brings smiles in addition to profits. `` I've been doing some of the shooting myself,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` The excitement _ you forget about it once you get out of high school. This is one way to keep it forever.''

 Prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> today rose to their second highest level ever, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar also strengthened against the Japanese yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 151.66-point loser on Friday, closed at 28,036.54, up 116.18 points, or 0.41 percent. It was 35.48 points short of its record high on Thursday, when it closed at 28,072.02. Volume was a moderate 900 million shares, down sharply from Friday's 2.2 billion. A stock analyst at a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> brokerage, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said traders were awaiting the release in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for April. Little news was available to affect the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market, because Sunday was a newspaper holiday in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and no papers appeared today. Electricals, automobiles, precision machineries and drugs rose, along with financial and foodstuff issues. Steels, textiles and chemicals fell.

<HEAD>For Ashland Oil, 1988 Has Been Good and Bad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASHLAND, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 1988 has been one public relations disaster after another. First there was an oil spill. Then there were complaints about pollution. Now a federal trial has gone against it. It all started Jan. 2 when a 4-million-gallon storage tank collapsed near <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, sending more than 700,000 gallons of diesel fuel into the <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> rivers in one of the worst inland oil spills in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. Two weeks later, the company was fined $ 95,000 for violating air pollution standards at its <LOCATION> Catlettsburg </LOCATION> refinery. State air quality officials received 80 complaints from nearby residents during three weeks in February and March. In mid-March, a report by the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> had violated regulations at its hazardous-waste dump near the refinery. But perhaps the biggest public relations problem of all hit Friday, when a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury in <LOCATION> Covington </LOCATION> ruled that the company engaged in racketeering in 1980 when it made payments to foreign government officials to obtain crude oil. The jury awarded nearly $ 70 million to former vice presidents <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who said they had been fired for refusing to take part in the payments and for telling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government agencies about the money. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, which is <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s largest corporation and the nation's largest independent oil refiner, said it would appeal. Whether the awards are whittled down by higher courts remains to be seen, but the company expects any payment to be covered by a $ 75 million policy with <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Money aside, however, observers say <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> has an image problem `` The public perception is that something must be wrong if it -LRB- the case -RRB- has gone this far,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lad </PERSON>, an assistant professor of management at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said some lawyers following the case figured <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> would win by persuading jurors its past business practices were commonplace. <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said the jury's decision may reflect some anger among consumers. `` There is the feeling that big business _ the Fortune 500 companies _ have gotten away with murder,'' he said. A public explanation might improve <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>'s image, suggested <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and author of `` When It Hits the Fan,'' a book on corporate crises. `` The way to lose in the court of public opinion is to hide behind your lawyers,'' <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> said. He said the burden of repairing the company's public image rests with its current chairman, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. `` Nobody is as believable as the chief executive officer,'' <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> said. That's a notion Hall reinforced in January, when he drew national praise for publicly discussing the massive oil spill. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> said Saturday that he thinks Hall will make a statement, although it wo n't come until the company files legal motions related to Friday's decision. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> has 10 days to do so. <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> said the public relations problems have masked an otherwise good financial year for the company. In the six months that ended March 31, <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 67 million, not including a one-time gain of $ 31 million, compared with $ 22 million a year earlier. Revenue also rose, to $ 3.9 billion from $ 3.2 billion in 1987. `` If you really want to know how the year has been for the company, it has been very good,'' <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> said. `` I think the shareholders are pleased by the performance of the company. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> has interests in petroleum, coal, chemicals and construction.

 The dollar rose against most major currencies in early European trading today, and dealers said activity would remain sluggish until Tuesday's release of the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures. Gold prices fell in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> from Friday's closing bids but were up slightly from the late bid price in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold plunged almost $ 7 an ounce in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Friday to $ 449 after European markets closed, largely because of falling oil prices. Foreign exchange dealers in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said the dollar received support from a remark by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vice </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> on Saturday. He said there is some room for the currency to rise. But traders said the market will remain hard to move until release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> April trade deficit. <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> dealers predicted the deficit would show a widening to $ 12.2 billion from an adjusted $ 11.95 billion in March. `` Everyone's waiting for the figures,'' said a dealer at a large <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> bank. `` Very little business will be done today,'' predicted one trader with a major Italian commercial bank in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. Both spoke on condition of anonymity. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar closed at 125.19 yen, up from 124.85 late Friday. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted slightly higher at 125.12 yen. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Friday's rates: 1.7221 West German marks, up from 1.7180; 1.4425 Swiss francs, up from 1.4355 5.8220 French francs, up from 5.8040; 1.9133 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9280; 1,281.65 Italian lire, up from 1,278.50; and 1.22075 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2191 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $ 1.8250 to buy one pound, up from $ 1.8175. Bullion dealers said trading was also quiet pending Tuesday's release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 451.10 a troy ounce and at mid-morning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 450.50, both down from late Friday's bid of $ 456.20. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 450.50, down from $ 458.00 late Friday. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> financial markets were closed today to celebrate the official birthday of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>.

 Foreign ministers of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> on Monday approved an accord establishing formal relations with the Soviet-led Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, or Comecon. The agreement was initialled by <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Comecon </ORGANIZATION> officials last week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. It is to be put into force at an official signing ceremony in <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> on June 25. The pact sets the stage for exchanges of information but does n't establish bilateral trade relations It marks the Communist bloc's first official recognition of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> since the Common Market was created 31 years ago. For years, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and its Communist allies virtually ignored the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, calling it a quasi-military extension of the American-led <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Comecon </ORGANIZATION> have been negotiating the terms of a joint declaration on mutual recognition since September 1985. <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> member nations include: <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s partners in <ORGANIZATION> Comecon </ORGANIZATION> are <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>. Trade between <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Comecon </ORGANIZATION> members totaled about $ 50 billion last year, about half of which was between the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, according to the June issue of <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION>, a Brussels-based newsletter. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> has sought to emphasize bilateral contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> Comecon </ORGANIZATION> member countries rather than bloc-to-bloc relations. This is mainly because the Common Market says <ORGANIZATION> Comecon </ORGANIZATION> does not have equivalent authority to decide trade and other issues for its members. Last week, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> submitted formal requests to open their own bilateral diplomatic relations with the EEC. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> hopes to wrap up a bilateral trade and cooperation agreement with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> this year. During their <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> meeting, the foreign ministers gave the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> negotiators new instructions for the <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> talks.

Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 16.54 million shares. Gainers slightly outnumbered losers, with 496 up, 423 down and 491 unchanged.

 Takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> says he discussed a joint acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> with two Canadian oil concerns and that <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> verbally agreed to finance such a deal. The disclosures were contained in a weekend deposition of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder conducted by attorneys for the oil giant, reported today by the Wall Street Journal. The deposition was part of escalating legal maneuvers between <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> over his attempt to buy the company for $ 60 a share, which values it at $ 14.6 billion. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> have been engrossed in an acrimonious takeover dispute since last month, the latest episode in the troubled oil giant's attempt to normalize following its prolonged bankruptcy-court ordeal. The investor, who owns 14.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock, is conducting a proxy fight for five seats on the company's board in an effort to pressure management into letting shareholders vote on his takeover offer. Results of the proxy contest will be disclosed at the company's annual meeting this Friday. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> disclosed to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> lawyers that in the last two weeks he held separate discussions toward a possible takeover partnership with <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Husky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> also said a <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> representative assured him that financing a <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> takeover was `` eminently doable. His disclosures could substantiate <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s claim that <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has improperly failed to disclose the extent of his takeover talks with other parties. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing. Other court documents unsealed at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> indicate <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> once tried to arrange the purchase of a large stake in <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> held by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to Canadian investor <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Belzberg </PERSON>, but the deal never happened because of a price disagreement. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> attorneys say those documents suggest <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> may have improperly attempted to find allies for coordinated purchases of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock as part of a broader plan to take over the company. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has denied such charges in the past. On Friday, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said he was forming a new holding company to act as his sole vehicle for acquisitions, including a bid for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>. He said the holding company intended to raise up to $ 3.25 billion through an offering of stock and debt securities. The <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> group of companies also will contribute equity to the holding company, including its 36.1 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> and its interests in <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ACF </ORGANIZATION>, a leasing company. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> began acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock last year when the company was mired in bankruptcy-court proceedings and its stock was trading $ 20 lower than the current price of about $ 51 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> sought federal bankruptcy protection in April 1987 when it faced a record $ 10.53 billion judgment to <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> awarded by a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> jury that found <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> improperly interfered with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to buy <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> settled with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> two months ago by paying it $ 3 billion and has proposed a post-bankruptcy recovery involving the sale of $ 5 billion in assets

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers today met informally to discuss whether to change their existing oil production quota, amid speculation that the talks have stalled. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on Sunday adjourned its regular midyear conference to allow the 13-nation cartel's oil ministers to informally discuss disagreements. The conference began Saturday and will resume Tuesday. The ministers have been considering whether to change an existing agreement among 12 of the members that limits their oil production to 15.06 million barrels a day. That quota, which was extended in December and expires June 30, was aimed at supporting oil prices at $ 18 a barrel. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has refused to sign the agreement because it wants an output quota equal to that of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, at war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since September 1980, was granted a quota of 1.54 million barrels a day in a previous agreement. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s daily quota is 2.369 million barrels. Some <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members want to cut production to push oil prices up, while others want to increase output or at least hold it steady to take advantage of an expected increase in demand later this year. But analysts believe <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is so deeply divided it will extend the existing agreement for at least three months. `` We are working on compromise,'' <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> oil minister <PERSON> Ginandjar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kartasasmita </PERSON> said today. `` There are agreements on most of the issues.'' He said he strongly believed the cartel would make a decision either Tuesday or Wednesday. `` There will definitely be an agreement,'' added Saudi Arabian oil minister <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON>. But ministerial sources from two countries also said Sunday that the cartel _ expecting a stalemate _ was most likely to extend the current production quota. `` There's a degree of disappointment and confusion,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, an oil analyst at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. Adding to the confusion was the departure of two Arab oil ministers, with one expected to return by Tuesday but the other saying he might not. <PERSON> Mana </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Oteiba </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>' oil minister, said Sunday he was returning to his country for consultations with his government and that he might or might not return. He gave no reason for his sudden departure. Kuwaiti Oil Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> will leave today, but will return in time for the Tuesday session, members of his delegation said. Observers speculated that <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> was going to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to appear before the British government's <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> about <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s purchase of more than 20 percent of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. `` The fact that <PERSON> Oteiba </PERSON> must consult with his supeiors is very reminiscent of a stall. It's awfully convenient, is n't it?'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gignoux </PERSON>, managing director of the <ORGANIZATION> international </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Oil markets were disappointing today, with the spot price of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> Brent Blend, the most widely traded international crude oil, falling to 55 cents to $ 15.30 a barrel and then held steady on the spot market. The 13 members of the cartel are <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling On Federal Home Loan Bank Bonds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let stand a ruling that states indirectly may tax interest paid to financial institutions from investments in <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> bonds. The court, citing the lack of a `` substantial federal question,'' rejected a challenge to a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> bank franchise tax. The <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> challenged the tax, seeking a refund of $ 197,310 it paid under protest to the state for the years 1979 through 1982. During that period, the bank reported $ 2.82 million in interest from <ORGANIZATION> FHLB </ORGANIZATION> bonds. The sum was included in the bank's net earnings that were subject to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s franchise tax, which is imposed on financial institutions for the privilege of doing business in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. The difficulty over whether earnings from <ORGANIZATION> FHLB </ORGANIZATION> bonds are taxable arises because of two apparently conflicting federal laws. A 1932 law that created the <ORGANIZATION> FHLB </ORGANIZATION> generally exempts the bonds from taxes. But a law enacted in 1862 permits states to levy a `` non-discriminatory franchise tax'' on `` stocks and obligations of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government'' that generally are exempt from state and local taxes. The <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the state franchise tax, ruling in October that the 1862 law takes precedence. The state court based its ruling in part on a 1975 opinion by the general counsel's office of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The state court said a franchise tax paid for the privilege of doing business in the state is not the same as a direct tax on a bank's income. The state court also said the tax does not violate the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, which binds states to adhere to federal law. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> vs. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessments </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1080.

<HEAD>NEC Earnings Rise 69 Percent In Fiscal Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the Japanese electronics giant, said its profit rose 68.7 percent in its latest fiscal year from the depressed level of a year earlier, partly because of a recovery in its world-leading sales of semiconductors. Sales climbed 10.8 percent. The company predicted further gains in its current fiscal year, which ends March 31, 1989, estimating gains of about 90 percent in profit and 7 percent in sales. <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> said its profit rose to 25.4 billion yen, or about $ 205 million, from 10.3 billion yen in the previous year. Revenue rose to 2.71 trillion yen, or $ 21.9 billion, from 2.45 trillion yen a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> announced its profits on Friday in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, but the report was not circulated in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> until Monday. In addition to a recovered market for semiconductors, <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> cited `` steady progress'' in such fields as communications equipment, computers, industrial electronic systems and home electronics. Domestic sales rose 12.2 percent and overseas sales rose 7.2 percent. Equity in earnings of affiliated companies _ mainly subsidiaries in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries _ jumped 146 percent, partly on the strength of a stronger yen. The results in yen were translated into dollars at a rate of 124 yen to the dollar.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Mostly Lower In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened mostly higher then turned mostly lower today as rainy weather dampened bullish enthusiasm on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat futures were lower from the start, reflecting weekend rains in the drought-stricken northern Plains, analysts said. Reports of rain today in the western Corn Belt quickly put soybean and corn traders on edge and prices for those commodities turned lower as well. `` Some traders are very nervous about rain showing up -LRB- in the central <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> -RRB- in the next three days,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He noted that the November soybean contract, for delivery of new-crop beans, fluctuated within a 9-cent range in the session's opening minutes `` That shows you the amount of hesitancy and uncertainty here,'' <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. Oat futures continued to climb on the perception that dry conditions have already destroyed part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oat crop, analysts said. In early trading, wheat was 3 cents to 6 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.68 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 3 \ cents lower with July at $ 2.56 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 6 cents higher with July at $ 2.66 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 16 cents lower with July at $ 8.70 a Cattle futures were lower while pork futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .25 cent to .70 cent lower with June at 71.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .50 cent lower with August at 74.90 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower to .40 cent higher with June at 51.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .27 cent lower to .10 cent higher with July at 49.80 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today barred states from banning all direct mail advertisements sent by lawyers to potential clients. The court, by a 6-3 vote, ruled in a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> case that states violate free-speech rights when they prohibit lawyers from soliciting business by sending truthful and nondeceptive letters to people they know face particular legal problems. Writing for the court, Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said states may require lawyers to file copies of such soliciting letters with a state agency authorized to penalize actual abuses. But <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said the potential for abuse does not justify a total ban, as imposed in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. `` Our recent decisions involving commercial speech have been grounded in the faith that the free flow of commercial information is valuable enough to justify imposing on would-be regulators the costs of distinguishing the truthful from the false, the helpful from the misleading and the harmless from the harmful,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. He was joined by Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The three dissenters _ Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> _ said it was time to overturn the 1977 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that first overturned the legal profession's longtime ban on any type of lawyer advertising. `` Rather than continuing to work out all the consequences of -LRB- the 1977 ruling's approach -RRB- we should now return to the states the legislative function that has so inappropriately been taken from them in the context of attorney advertising,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> wrote for the three. The court's 1977 decision said a total ban on lawyer advertising violates free-speech rights. Like other commercial speech, however, lawyer ads are constitutionally protected only when truthful and nondeceptive. The court in 1978 expressly prohibited lawyers from seeking business through in-person solicitation of people known to have legal problems. But today, the court said that in some cases solicitation through direct mailings must be allowed. `` Admittedly, a letter that is personalized to the recipient presents an increased risk of deception, intentional or inadvertent,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. `` But merely because targeted, direct-mail solicitation presents lawyers with opportunities for isolated abuses or mistakes does not justify a total ban on that mode of protected commercial speech,'' he added. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s total ban, fashioned by the state's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, follows the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> model rule that direct-mail solicitation be banned `` when a significant motive for the lawyer's doing so is the lawyer's pecuniary gain. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> model, now declared constitutionally unsound, has been adopted by <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. Three states _ <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> _ adopted direct-mail bans more restrictive than the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> model. They also now are likely to fall in the face of a free-speech challenge. In <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, the ban on targeted direct-mail ads was challenged by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapero </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> lawyer. <PERSON> Shapero </PERSON> had wanted to send a letter to potential clients against whom foreclosure lawsuits had been filed, but he was told that mailing such a solicitation would violate the state lawyer-ethics rules. <PERSON> Shapero </PERSON>'s case now returns to the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for further study. The case is <PERSON> Shapero </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, 87-l6.

The 1933 federal law, the Glass-Steagall Act, was passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929. The law placed various restrictions on banks, in large measure to protect deposits from being squandered on Wall Street. In recent years, the wall of separation between commercial and investment bank activities has been lowered. At issue in the case acted on today were rulings by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> allowing some of the nation's leading banks to use subsidiaries to underwrite and deal in municipal revenue bonds, mortgage-related securities and commercial paper. The latter is a form of IOU used by corporations to finance short-term debt. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> last year said bank subsidiaries may underwrite and deal in such securities as long as they do not exceed 5 to 10 percent of the subsidary's gross revenue. The board said that is in line with the Glass-Stegall Act's requirement that banks may not affiliate with an organization `` engaged principally'' in underwriting or dealing in securities The board's rulings were challenged by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group of underwriters, brokers andd securities dealers. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in February upheld the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> decisions, and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration urged the justices to leave intact the appeals court rulng. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> acted properly, and that any change in banking regulations should be left to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The government noted that a moratorium <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> imposed on the type of banking activities involved in the dispute expired in March, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not renewed it. Moreover, legislation is pending to repeal parts of the Glass-Steagall Act. Reacting to today's decision, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We are disappointed the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decided not to hear our appeal to prevent banks, through affiliates, from engaging in a wide range of securities.'' `` But we are pleased the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> itself has erected a series of firewalls ... to prevent banks from taking excessive risks within the securities arena which would further weaken banks and thus endanger the nation's economy,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pistor </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` This is another hole in the anti-competitive Glass-Steagall Act and another important victory for consumers. But, before large numbers of bank customers will benefit, we need to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act and allow all banks to offer securities services.'' The case is <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1513.

<HEAD>Noboru Who? Poll Reveals Americans' Ignorance Of Japanese Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

 A poll released Monday found that only four of 1,500 Americans could name the Japanese prime minister, while 90 percent of 2,000 Japanese knew the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president was named <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. For the record, the Japanese leader is <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, the leader of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s dominant <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, who succeeded <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> as prime minister seven months ago after serving as finance minister in <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s cabinet. The poll was conducted jointly in May by the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Broadcasting System and CBS. Most of the questions involved trade issues. Seventy-two percent of the Americans polled said they favored protection for domestic agricultural markets, while about 60 percent of the 2,000 Japanese surveyed said the same about their markets. Forty-three percent of Americans said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s barriers on imports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef and citrus fruit were improper, and only 14 percent considered them fair. Among Japanese respondents, 59 percent said the restrictions were fair and 29 percent unfair. The network released the survey results on its news programs one day before Deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> reopens stalemated talks with Japanese officials over beef and orange imports in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has said it will phase out beef import restrictions over a three-year period, but needs a 70 percent tariff on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef to keep prices in line with domestic levels. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials want a substantially lower tariff. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators are also expected to urge <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to liberalize its citrus market in three years, instead of the five-year period proposed by <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The margin of error in the poll was not specified.

 The stock market eased slightly today after seesawing in a narrow range. Analysts noted that traders are reluctant to take on large positions ahead of Tuesday's release of merchandise trade figures for April. The trade report is the first in a flurry of economic indicators due to be released this week that should shed a strong light on the state of the economy. `` There is a feeling of optimism ... that the numbers will paint a picture that the economy is slowing from the breakneck inflationary pace of the first three months, and that's what the market needs,'' noted <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. That optimism was reflected in the ability of the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials to hover around the 2,100 level `` The most revealing thing about this market is that ... we ca n't drive it down,'' noted <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Seagle </PERSON>, vice president and director of technical research at <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The ability of the Dow to hug the 2,100 level is a signal that this market has started some kind of a summer rally,'' he said. The Dow started the week about eight points shy of its post-crash high, and traders began the session by cashing in on the previous weeks' gains. The Dow had been off about 10 points before turning upward and then seesawing throughout the rest of the session. Institutional investors, mutual funds and foreign buyers are sitting on the sidelines with plenty of cash, and their decisions about whether to re-enter the market could hinge on the upcoming economic data. Among the reports to be issued this week are retail sales, industrial production, business inventories, factory capacity and housing starts.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling Monday on vaccine liability likely affects only a small group of pharmaceutical manufacturers, but may substantially change how the government approves future inoculations, industry analysts said. The nation's high court said those harmed by a vaccine can sue the government agencies that approved its use. `` This is very good for the vaccine companies, but there are not that many of them,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Vieter </PERSON>, a drug industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` One might look ahead to vaccines such as AIDS vaccines and other bio-tech applications, though. `` It seems the government will have to exert quite a bit more care in the approval process to prevent placing the government in a liability situation,'' <PERSON> Vieter </PERSON> said. The court, in a 9-0 vote, reinstated a suit by the parents of a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> boy who contracted polio after receiving a dose of a federally approved vaccine manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, a subsidiary of American Cyanimid. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stover </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the question of whether the government can be held liable for approving drugs and vaccines that eventually harm someone has been hotly debated for years. `` It should be very significant for that part of the industry and <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> in particular,'' he said. <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Homma </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION>, said the company's top executives and legal department want to study the decision before issuing a comment. <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> shares the majority of the vaccine production business in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rahway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>' Wyeth Division of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Canadian company. Officials from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> also declined to comment, though one <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> executive said `` it's about time'' the government is held accountable for the approval process. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the group's legal department also wants to study the decision before any statement is made <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers argued before the court that if such damage suits are allowed, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which currently tests and licenses vaccines, may be forced into the business of insuring them, jeopardizing the entire drug-approval process. The polio vaccine Orimun, a form of <PERSON> Sabin </PERSON> oral vaccine, was administered to 3-month-old <PERSON> Kevan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkovitz </PERSON> in 1979. Three months later, the child contracted polio and is now paralyzed, partially deformed and can breathe only with the help of a machine. The vaccine was approved by the federal government in 1963. The <PERSON> Berkovitz </PERSON>'s suit was rejected by the 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> in 1987.

Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 151.717 million shares. The Dow started off the week about eight points shy of its post-crash high, and traders began the session by cashing in on the previous weeks' gains. The Dow fell about 10 points before turning upward and continuing its flirtation with the 2,100 mark. But `` this general level has presented some pretty stiff resistance for the market,'' noted <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's pretty clear we will need a catalyst ... -LRB- such as -RRB- some news that gets us over the hump,'' he added. Tuesday's report on merchandise trade figures for April is probably not enough to singlehandedly boost the Dow beyond the 2,100-point ceiling, analysts said. But the trade report is only the first in a flurry of economic indicators due to be released this week. `` There is a feeling of optimism ... that the numbers will paint a picture that the economy is slowing from the breakneck inflationary pace of the first three months, and that's what the market needs,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Despite the dullness of the day's trading `` the most revealing thing about this market is that ... we ca n't drive it down,'' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Seagle </PERSON>, vice president and director of technical research at <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The ability of the Dow to hug the 2,100 level is a signal that this market has started some kind of a summer rally,'' he said. Institutional investors, mutual funds and foreign buyers are sitting on the sidelines with plenty of cash, and their decisions about whether to re-enter the market could hinge on the upcoming economic data. Other reports to be issued this week include retail sales, industrial production, business inventories, factory capacity and housing starts. Among actively traded issues, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 -RRB- to 50 -LCB-. The oil giant's largest shareholder, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, revealed he has put $ 310 million in escrow to back his bid for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> and that he has held talks with <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Husky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> about the possibility of forming a joint venture to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Sag As Rain Prospects Improve</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices sagged and trading activity lagged Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid forecasts for rain in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> later this week. Grain futures finished mixed, however, reflecting uncertainty about the amount of moisture that drought-ridden croplands are likely to receive, analysts said. On other markets, coffee futures slumped; livestock and meat were mostly lower; energy futures declined; precious metals were slightly higher; and stock-index futures advanced. The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s index of 21 agricultural and industrial commodities retreated 1.26 points to 256.35. Soybean futures, which hit 4 -LCB- - year highs above $ 9 a bushel last week, turned lower on reports that showers were moving eastward from the western edge of the Corn Belt `` There is some rain coming in and the market, at least today, felt it would be beneficial'' for the crops, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Activity was markedly lighter than in last week's sessions, which saw grain and soybean futures prices rise dramatically as traders bet on a lengthy dry spell `` There were a lot of traders on the sidelines today, watching, hoping and praying,'' <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. Analyst <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartholomew </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> noted a significant reduction in soybean contract purchases by commercial firms and said commercial buying interest may have peaked last week. After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued a 6 - to 10-day outlook calling for above-normal temperatures and normal precipitation in most major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crop-growing areas during the first five days of next week Also after the close, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean planting was 90 percent complete as of Sunday with most of the crop in fair to good condition. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> reported slight deterioration in the corn crop but said most of the crop remained in fair to good shape, and said 9 percent of the winter wheat crop had been harvested, with most of that crop also in fair to good condition. Wheat settled 2 cents to 5 cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.69 -RCB- a bushel; corn was unchanged to 2 cents higher with July at $ 2.59 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 3 cents lower to 2 cents higher with July at $ 2.62 a bushel; soybeans were 2 -LCB- cents to 8 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 8.77 a bushel. Coffee futures posted sharp losses on the Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in response to milder-than-expected weekend weather in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, which produces about one-third of the world's coffee Coffee traders had bid up prices last week on expectations of freezing temperatures during the weekend in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. A freeze would have threatened <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s 1989-90 coffee crop, which is at the sensitive bud stage, but not the 1988-89 crop, which is now being harvested, said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaul </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Coffee settled 1.75 cents to 2.23 cents lower with July at $ 1.3630 a pound Frozen pork-belly futures fell sharply for the fifth consecutive session on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as prices continued to seek a level that will encourage sales of near-record supplies of frozen bellies on the cash market, analysts said. Near-month hog futures were supported by stronger cash markets. Cattle futures were pressured by weak technical and fundamental factors and by jitters about this Friday's monthly cattle-on-feed report from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle settled .37 cent to .78 cent lower with June at 71.95 cents a pound; feeder catle were .60 cent to 1.25 cents lower with August at 74 cents a pound; hogs were .55 cent lower to .40 cent higher with June at 51.55 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1 cent to 1.93 cents lower with July at 48.35 cents a pound. Energy futures fell in response to indications that the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, meeting this week in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, will take no action to reduce production of crude oil, analysts said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 10 cents to 30 cents lower with July at $ 16.43 a barrel; heating oil was .29 cent to .50 cent lower with July at 43.75 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .58 cent to .71 cent lower with July at 48.51 cents a gallon. Gold futures were nearly unchanged while silver advanced slightly on the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold settled 50 cents to 70 cents higher with August at $ 453.80 a troy ounce; silver was 2.9 cents to 4 cents higher with July at $ 7.055 a troy ounce. Stock-index futures advanced slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled .60 point higher at 271.70.

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Higher; Gold Rises After Falling in Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose slightly Monday, but brokers said trading was extremely quiet prior to the release of monthly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures and the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> economic summit. Gold prices also advanced slightly in restrained <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading after falling more than $ 7 an ounce in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted gold at $ 449.70 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 449 late Friday. Foreign-exchange dealers attributed the sluggish trading partly to their own reluctance to speculate about the dollar's movement prior to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for April, due Tuesday morning. The trade numbers are a powerful influence on the dollar because they have become the most visible symbol of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' unrelenting appetite for imports, a sensitive political and economic issue The nation's deficit shrank to a three-year low of $ 9.7 billion in March, surprising many traders and giving the dollar a substantial boost. But some fear the March number was grossly low and the April deficit could therefore be unexpectedly high, despite a strengthening of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports in recent months. Estimates on the April deficit ranged from below $ 9 billion to above $ 14.5 billion. `` Each number has exasperated traders because it is so unpredictable,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, vice president and chief corporate dealer in <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. `` But last month's numbers were so good that the chances of a surprise seem sort of big.'' <PERSON> Varick </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, vice president of foreign exchange at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Switzerland </ORGANIZATION>'s office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said another big restraint on trading is the summit of leaders of seven industrialized democracies, starting Sunday in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. `` I ca n't expect anything to happen -LRB- to the dollar -RRB-, even with the trade numbers, until the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> summit is over,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 125.19 Japanese yen, up slightly from 124.85 yen late Friday. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 125.10 yen. By the time trading concluded in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar was worth 125.12 yen, higher than its 124.88 yen on Friday. The British pound fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to $ 1.8165 from $ 1.8175 late Friday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the pound was quoted at $ 1.8165, cheaper than $ 1.8178 late Friday. Other late-dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday, included: 1.7227 West German marks, up from 1.7211; 1.4407 Swiss francs, up from 1.4391; 1.2207 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2199; 5.8195 French francs, up from 5.8135; and 1,280.25 Italian lire, up from 1,278.88. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday, included: 1.7241 West German marks, up from 1.7180; 1.4424 Swiss francs, up from 1.4355; 5.7265 French francs, down from 5.8040; 1.9345 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9280; 1,281.75 Italian lire, up from 1,278.50; 1.2203 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2191. Gold futures prices rose slightly in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for immediate delivery was quoted at $ 449.60 an ounce, up 50 cents from late Friday. Earlier in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> gold fell to $ 449 from $ 456.20 late Friday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid price of $ 448.50, down from $ 458 late Friday. The sharp drops were largely a response to a plunge in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gold prices late Friday because of falling oil prices, after European markets had closed. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> markets were closed Monday for a holiday. Silver traded in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a late bid price of $ 7.02 a troy ounce, down from $ 7.17 late Friday. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION>, silver was quoted at $ 7.025, up 4 cents.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Edge Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices edged higher Monday as oil prices slipped and traders looked ahead to the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit figures for April. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year bond rose \ point, or $ 2.50 per $ 1,000 in face value, as its yield fell to 9.01 percent from 9.04 percent late Friday. Market watchers said a fresh decline in oil prices helped alleviate some of the recent worries about inflation, which erodes bond values. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the July contract for the benchmark <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> crude oil fell 30 cents to close at $ 16.43 per 42-gallon barrel. The 13-nation <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> failed to come up with a new pricing and production agreement over the weekend at its ministerial meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Analysts said bond trading was relatively quiet in advance of the trade figures due to be released Tuesday morning. `` Everyone is waiting for the trade number,'' said <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> <PERSON> Won </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Norwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. He said the consensus among economists is that the trade deficit widened in April slightly from a seasonally adjusted $ 11.95 billion in March. He expects a deficit of $ 12.5 billion. The release of the trade figures has often caused a sharp reaction in the currency markets, and that has often had an impact on bond prices. Meanwhile, interest rates at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s latest auction of three-month securities were unchanged from a week ago while rates on new six-month bills fell slightly. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 6.4 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 6.44 percent, identical to last week's rate It sold $ 6.4 billion in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 6.67 percent, down from 6.72 percent last week. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said the average yield for one-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, the most popular index for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, dropped to 7.46 percent last week from 7.59 percent the previous week. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term government issues rose about -LRB- point, intermediate maturities rose about \ point and long-term issues were up nearly -LCB- point, the financial information service <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said. The movement of a point equals a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION>, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.11 to 109.88. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, rose 1.51 to 1,150.21. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.35 to 281.90. In the tax-exempt market, prices of municipal bonds rose 3-16 point, according to the Bond Buyer Municipal Bond Index. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills fell 1 basis point to 6.44 percent, six-month bills rose a basis point to 6.66 percent and one-year bills were unchanged at 6.94 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted late in the day at 7 -LCB- percent, up from 75-16 percent late Friday.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday it is selling its subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>, acquired recently in a takeover duel, to an affiliate of the privately held <ORGANIZATION> Riklis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 950 million in cash and $ 250 million in securities. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, said it will buy back seven companies including five that it expects will accelerate development of its emerging core businesses in hardware and home products and office products. The company also said it planned to continue an ongoing program to buy back its own stock. The E-II companies being retained by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> include <ORGANIZATION> Aristokraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Waterloo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Twentieth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as well as <ORGANIZATION> Day-Timers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Vogel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peterson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, previously acquired from <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>' ACCO World subsidiary. American Brands will also buy back from <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION> two other operations _ the <ORGANIZATION> Stiffel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Aunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nellie </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kitchens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Riklis </PERSON> will pay about $ 950 million in cash and $ 250 million in preferred stock for the remaining operations of <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION> also has $ 1.5 billion in subordinated debt. The purchase price for all the companies being retained by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> _ not including <PERSON> Stiffel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Nellie </PERSON>'s, still in negotiation _ is $ 645 million <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> acquired the outstanding common stock of Chicago-based E-II in February for $ 17.05 per share in a deal worth about $ 1.1 billion. The acquisition followed a brief but fierce battle in which <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> launched a bid to take over <ORGANIZATION> E-II </ORGANIZATION> after the Chicago-based company said it might try to acquire <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> by gaining control of the company's board of directors through a shareholder vote.

 <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has received a $ 1.5 billion order for 61 of its MD-80 series airplanes from Scandinavian Airlines System, the aircraft maker announced Monday. The order includes firm commitments to buy 24 planes and an option to buy 37 more. The $ 1.5 billion figure is for all 61 planes. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> declined to put a value on firm orders alone, spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. Based on the estimated price of $ 22 million to $ 25 million which industry sources put on the MD-80, the firm orders would be worth around $ 900 million. <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> ordered four models of the MD-80, a twin-engine, medium-range jetliner that seats up to 150 passengers. The order is divided among MD-81, 82, 83 and 87 models. The planes are scheduled for delivery in 1991 and 1992.

 Thousands of migrant workers are picking strawberries after waiting weeks for crops to ripen and straining the resources of social service agencies who provided them food and shelter. Cool weather slowed the ripening of the strawberry crop, which traditionally is ready for harvest by June 1. Officials said an unusually heavy influx of 20,000 migrant workers, many from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, have been waiting for the work to begin. Warm weather over the weekend ripened many fields in the northwestern portion of the state, and others are expected to be ready for picking soon. <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> is the nation's second-largest strawberry producer after <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` A lot of fields just turned red over the weekend because of the good weather,'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Graven </PERSON>, a division field supervisor for the state Employment Division, said Monday. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Malensky </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hillsboro </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, said it was too early to say how many of the migrants would be put to work because picking has n't begun yet in many fields. `` Last year it started with a bang and kept on going. This year it's starting slowly and wo n't get into full flow till this weekend,'' he said. Social service agencies have made repeated appeals for food and blankets for the migrants, who hav been living with as many as 50 others in one room. The <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, one of several charitable organizations helping feed and clothe the migrants, has distributed more than 277 tons of food and more than $ 100,000 worth of clothing, blankets and items such as soap, detergent and cooking utensils. Once the harvest is in full swing, `` it will considerably decrease the demands upon us,'' said <PERSON> Titus </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. `` I know that many of them still have obligations to contractors and in some cases to farmers for food,'' Titus said of the pickers. `` ... Maybe for the next couple of weeks they still will be technically without any money, but beyond that they will have money and chances are the social services will be able to step out of the situation, maybe not completely but considerably. We're already seeing a decrease in demand.'' The 1987 strawberry crop ripened early, and 20 percent of it was left in the fields because of a picker shortage. Growers complained that pickers were confused over the new immigration law and refused to cross the border. The state still produced a bumper crop of 94 million pounds that sold for a record $ 31.5 million. This year, migrants began arriving as early as April. Some say they mistakenly were told they had to file immigration legalization documents by May 4, the deadline for aliens not involved in agricultural work. The agricultural workers have until Nov. 30 to file the papers. After that, employers who hire illegal migrant workers will face stiff penalties.

 <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday that its earnings dropped by more than 50 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, largely because of two unsuccessful attempts to take over other companies.

 <ORGANIZATION> Cantario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it had proposed to top <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 4.18 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Dome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, but a Dome executive said his company declined to consider the proposal because it was conditional and Dome had questions about the financing. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON>, a Dome executive, told reporters that <PERSON> Cantario </PERSON>'s proposal included a condition that Dome cancel its agreement to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> before <PERSON> Cantario </PERSON> made its formal offer The previously-undisclosed proposal was revealed on the first day of a fairness hearing before Justice <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Alberta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bench </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON> is to decide whether to allow <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> to close the acquisition deal that Dome shareholders approved last week. When <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON> asked which parties objected to the deal, a lawyer representing <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehman </PERSON> told the judge that his client, acting as an agent for <LOCATION> Cantario </LOCATION>, had proposed to pay about $ 4.9 billion for Dome last June. <PERSON> Rehman </PERSON> was in the courtroom, but refused to answer reporters' questions about Cantario or its bid The lawyer, <PERSON> Garold </PERSON> <PERSON> Switzer </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON> he would argue that the Cantario bid should have been disclosed to shareholders before they voted on <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION>'s offer last week. Shareholders, who voted 88 percent in favor of accepting <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION>'s offer, were not informed of the offer. Little said the Cantario offer was n't disclosed because `` we did n't think there was anything to disclose.'' Dome asked Cantario to remove the condition on its offer and was ready to review it, <PERSON> Little </PERSON> said, but <PERSON> Cantario </PERSON> said its bid was valid only if the <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> deal ended. Little said <PERSON> Cantario </PERSON> told Dome it had a line of credit with a major Canadian bank, but that the chairman of the bank denied the line of credit existed. He said Dome went back to <LOCATION> Cantario </LOCATION> and was told <PERSON> Cantario </PERSON> was trying to arrange credit with another bank but never got back to Dome. When asked by reporters why <PERSON> Cantario </PERSON> had n't gone public with its bid before now, <PERSON> Switzer </PERSON> said his client had hoped one of the other parties to the <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> deal would succeed in blocking it.

<HEAD>Report: Industrial Output to Grow 16 Percent in First Three
Quarters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s industrial output should grow by 16.3 percent during the first three quarters of this year, while the inflation rate could reach 13 percent during that time, according to an official report. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Minglu </PERSON>, economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, as saying industrial output will total $ 236 billion in the first nine months of the year. At the end of April, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s industrial output value was 17.9 percent higher than at the same time last year, the fastest growth in two years. The Chinese government has expressed concern about the rapid growth rate and tried to clamp down on credit and the beginning of new construction projects. The high growth rate, led by expansion of light industry, has strained government finances and depleted scarce raw materials needed for key heavy industry projects. In 1987, industrial output rose by 16.5 percent while the gross national product grew by 9.4 percent. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s commodity retail volume was up by 23.1 percent and retail prices rose 10.7 percent in the first quarter of this year, both highs for the past several years. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> said that as the state moves to end price controls over more commodities, inflation will continue to rise, hitting 12 percent in the second quarter and 13 percent in the third. Chinese economists regard inflation, spurred by rising consumer demand and the removal of price controls on some food products, as the most serious issue confronting the nation's economic reforms.

 A federal court jury for the first time held a cigarette company partly responsible for the death of a smoker, finding Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> failed to warn the public about the dangers of cigarettes and violated its promise to produce a safe product. The jury awarded $ 400,000 to <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>, whose wife <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> died of lung cancer in 1984, but rejected his claim of a conspiracy among the three tobacco companies that produced the products his wife used. The damage award was based on the jury's finding that <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> violated its expressed promise to consumers to make a safe product, thus contributing to Mrs. <PERSON> Cippollone </PERSON>'s death. It also found that <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> failed to warn the public about the dangers of cigarettes, but awarded no damages because it found Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> 80 percent responsible for her death. <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> were exonerated of conspiring to mislead the public about the dangers of smoking. The jury awarded no punitive damages. Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>, who was 58 when she died, smoked <LOCATION> Chesterfield </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> L </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M cigarettes, both made by <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>, before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> required the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> surgeon general's health warnings on cigarette packs in 1966. She smoked for 40 years, later using brands made by <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. `` The tobacco companies have claimed for the last 20 years that they are invincible,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Darnell </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>. `` This shows they are not ... they are just like any other company.'' <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearney </PERSON> said he was pleased by the verdict. `` The jury specifically rejected any claims of -LRB- punitive -RRB- damages,'' he said. `` The floodgates have been closed even firmer than they were before.'' <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s main attorney, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edell </PERSON>, said he was unsure whether the verdict would lead to more tobacco liability suits. `` I think the jury, for whatever reason, did n't like <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>. That's the problem. They never met <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>,'' he said. However, <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said he regarded the jury's award of $ 400,000 as `` sympathy,'' and said he would appeal. <PERSON> Edell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s attorney, said he would ask the judge to overturn the jury's decision that <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> pay no damages for the suffering of Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>. That money would have gone to her estate, unlike the $ 400,000 that goes to <LOCATION> Cipollone </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>, 64, of <LOCATION> Lakehurst </LOCATION>, said he was glad the trial was over, `` and I'm glad the verdict came out halfway a win.'' `` It was n't 100 percent. I'm glad that we won partial, but it's a start,'' he said Asked if his wife would be happy about the jury's findings, he said: `` I do n't really know. She started the suit, and I told her I'd continue'til the end.'' The jury began deliberations last Tuesday. As the forewoman answered each question from the court clerk, a gasp rose from the courtroom packed with industry lawyers, analysts and reporters. `` This is basically a victory for the defense,'' <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said. The tobacco industry, with $ 35 billion in revenue, waged an extensive and expensive defense against the suit, fearing that a loss could unleash a flood of multimillion dollar liability lawsuits. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s attorneys had said the case was especially significant because they got permission to introduce numerous secret corporate documents that spoke of a `` gentleman's agreement'' not to do cancer research, of an industry strategy to create `` doubt about the health charge without actually denying it,'' and of a research program designed `` so that results can not harm'' the industry The companies said statements in the documents represented the views of individuals and were taken out of context. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial markets were closed when the verdict was returned. One analyst suggested tobacco stocks might suffer early in Tuesday trading but the decision would be considered an industry victory in the long term. `` I consider this a major plus for the cigarette companies. It is a loss but not a major loss,'' said <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, a tobacco industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>. During the four-month trial, <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> charged that <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> misled the public about the dangers of cigarette smoking and contributed to Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s death. The companies contended that she knew the risks but chose to smoke anyway. They also argued that smoking is not a proven cause if cancer, and that her type of cancer has n't been linked to cigarettes anyway. To support the suit's contention that <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> violated its promise to consumers, <PERSON> Edell </PERSON> introduced examples of <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>'s advertising from the 1950s One said, `` <PERSON> Rosalind </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> says L & amp; M Filters are Just What the Doctor Ordered!'' Another ad said: `` Nose, Throat and Accessory Organs Not Adversely Affected By Smoking Chesterfields.'' Another said: `` Play Safe, Smoke Chesterfields.'' On Wednesday, the jury asked to see a copy of testimony she gave to lawyers the year of her death and trial testimony by an addiction expert who certified Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> was dependent on cigarettes. On Friday, they asked if the 1984 surgeon general's report on smoking and health was in evidence and whether they could see it. It was not, and the judge said they could not. The suit, filed in federal court Aug. 1, 1983, is one of only a dozen or so to go to a jury.
