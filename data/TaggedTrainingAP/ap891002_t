<HEAD>Norway Coalition Agrees To Topple Labor Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three opposition parties agreed on a basic platform for a new non-socialist coalition and stand ready to topple the minority government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Gro </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlem </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON>, an opposition leader said Monday. The emerging coalition was expected to submit a no-confidence motion in Parliament this month if Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> refuses to resign, the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Syse </PERSON>, who probably would become prime minister under the new coalition's plan, declined to reveal details of its platform until the three parliamentary groups review and approve the recommended policies. `` Lots of work remains to be done, including distribution of ministerial posts,'' <PERSON> Syse </PERSON> said on national <ORGANIZATION> NRK </ORGANIZATION> radio. The alliance of Conservative, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and Center parties won a total of 62 seats in the 165-seat parliament in Sept. 11 elections. Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON>'s Labor party won 63 seats, and the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, allied with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, won 17. There was one independent. The right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION>, with 22 seats, held the balance of power. Its chairman, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON>, says he would support a no-confidence vote against Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON>, but would not pledge future loyalty to the new coalition unless his party became a full partner. `` We are ready to present such a no-confidence motion, if necessary,'' <PERSON> Syse </PERSON> said in a radio interview. Mrs. <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s central board on Sunday she will decide the future of her government only after seeing the opposition's platform. The three non-socialist leaders demanded she resign as early as possible `` in order not to delay the coalition's and the Parliament's work,'' <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` She can chose to step down after Labor has presented its 1990 state budget proposal to the parliament on Oct. 12, or she risks being toppled by a general no-confidence vote on Oct. 24,'' the agency said.

<HEAD>Elvis Presley Haunts Jim Jarmusch's New Movie</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>'s involvement in the plot of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarmusch </PERSON>'s new movie, `` Mystery Train,'' was a mystery to the filmmaker. The writer-director of `` Stranger Than Paradise'' and `` Down by Law'' says he started with a few characters, like he always does, and came up with the idea for shooting the movie in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, home of Presley's Graceland mansion and <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>, where `` The King'' first recorded. `` He snuck in there; you got to watch out for him,'' said the director at a recent press conference after the film's preview at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Film Festival. `` When I first came to Memphis I went to Graceland immediately. By the time I left <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, I was so sick of Elvis I never wanted to hear about him again.'' But for now, questions about <PERSON> Jarmusch </PERSON> and Presley are unavoidable. <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> is everywhere in `` Mystery Train,'' named after an old blues song that Presley recorded at Sun. His music is on the soundtrack, his pictures hang in hotel rooms, characters see his ghost and <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON>, a working-class Englishman played by rock' n' roller <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Strummer </PERSON>, is even nicknamed `` Elvis. `` Mystery Train'' is broken into three segments, which take place in the same time frame: A young Japanese couple visit <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> to see Graceland and Sun; a young Italian woman, recently widowed, and a talkative stranger share a hotel room for one night; and three buddies are forced to leave town when <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> kills a liquor store clerk. `` The Japanese couple are fans, they're kind of an audience,'' <PERSON> Jarmusch </PERSON> says. `` As the story progesses, the way <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> is treated changes somwewhat. By the third story, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON>'s saying, ` That guy is everywhere.''' Fans of <PERSON> Jarmusch </PERSON>'s earlier films will quickly recognize the director's dark humor and fondness for characters usually found only in barrooms and poolhalls. `` Mystery Train'' is, however, <PERSON> Jarmusch </PERSON>'s first movie shot in color. `` I have to write very visually,'' he said. `` When I start to visualize the film, I make an intuitive decision and I stick to that. I ca n't say why. If you ask someone whether they dream in black and white or color, they ca n't say why. `` I have future projects and I already know that some are color and some are black and white.'' <PERSON> Jarmusch </PERSON> did say he will continue to make low-budget films outside the Hollywood studio system. He recalled a conversation with producer <PERSON> Dino </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLaurentiis </PERSON>. `` He asked me, ` Why do you make amateur films instead of professional ones?' I asked what made a film amateur or professional. He said any film that costs more than $ 5 million is professional. `` I guess I'm still making amateur films.'' The cast includes <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracco </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Aviles </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nicolette </PERSON> <PERSON> Braschi </PERSON> and rhythm' n' blues stars Screamin' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. `` Mystery Train'' is scheduled for a mid-November release by Orion Classics.

<TEXT>
 Strip away the orange ribbons, and <PERSON> Pulaski </PERSON>'s courthouse square could be a movie set for an archetypal Southern town, where a Confederate hero stands on a pedestal and pickup trucks sport <LOCATION> Dixie </LOCATION> flags. But the orange `` brotherhood color'' affixed to storefronts, lampposts, car antennas and coat lapels is meant to make sure no one confuses <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> residents with the white supremacists who plan to march through town Saturday. `` These people are outsiders and this county is a victim of rape by these groups,'' said author <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Mcdonald </PERSON>, who owns a farm in the area and helped organize the anti-march campaign. Restaurants, stores and markets have agreed to close for the day throughout the town of about 8,000 people 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>. Residents have been asked to stay off the streets, and churches have planned activities to keep children and teen-agers away from downtown. The racists are attracted to <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> by the town's role in the history of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. The group was founded in <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> in 1865 as a reaction to what community leaders saw as a threat by carpetbaggers and former slaves after the Civil War. It was disbanded four years later after the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> passed an anti-Klan law. The modern Klan was formed outside <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in 1915 by a former minister who added Jews and Catholics to the group's list of enemies. The Klan began marching in <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> annually in 1986 to protest the Martin Luther King national holiday. The parades typically draw fewer than 100 marchers. Community leaders say as long as the racists obtain the proper permits and follow other rules they ca n't be stopped. `` It started out as 35 to 40 old boys putting on their bed sheets and marching around the square haranguing,'' said <PERSON> Mcdonald </PERSON>, author of the `` Fletch'' mystery novels. `` These people considered the town's silence tacit approval. Nothing could be further from the truth.'' Town leaders decided it was time to act when the Aryan Nations of <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, announced plans to march here this year. The group advocates the formation of a whites-only country. Ten members of an Aryan Nations splinter group were convicted of racketeering in 1985 in a plot to overthrow the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government that involved murder, bank robbery and armed confrontations. `` We're just not going to let our town be taken over by bigots and hate mongers,'' said <PERSON> Bettie </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. Both sides claim <PERSON> Pulaski </PERSON>'s Civil War hero, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a 21-year-old Confederate scout who was hanged after refusing to reveal the name of a Rebel spy. Ms. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> helped wire an orange wreath to the hands of a statue of <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> on the town square. The white supremacists will lay a wreath also. `` He's our only hero, and they want to take him,'' Ms. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said. The Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, pastor of the Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> Christian-Aryan Nations, said the march was set on the day after <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' birthday to honor `` white heroes.'' `` <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was a hero of our people and nobody has ever honored him,'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>'s group claims several hundred members across the country, but he did not know how many to expect on Saturday. `` All members of our race are welcome,'' he said when asked whether Klan members and skinheads would march. He said the town's condemnation `` does n't bother us a bit.'' Police Chief <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> said at least 50 state and local officers will monitor the march. Residents concede that <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> is no utopia of racial equality. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McNairy </PERSON>, president of the local branch of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People, described race relatons as `` average.'' <LOCATION> Giles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is about 20 percent black. Ms. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> noted that the local country club has no black members. `` I think this whole thing will draw attention to some areas we have not examined closely enough before,'' she said. Businessman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> made his protest on the side of a building he owns. A bronze plaque commemorating the birth of the <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> has hung there for 72 years. This month he turned the plaque to the wall. `` If we just took it down, it really would n't say anything,'' <PERSON> Massey </PERSON> said. `` This was my way to say we ca n't just turn our backs on the other signs of bigotry and hatred as if they were n't there.''

 Leftist rebels dynamited a lunch counter two blocks from where <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sits, seriously wounding eight breakfasting policemen and two other customers, police said. Also Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Maoist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas shot to death the deputy administrator of the highland city of <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION> and a companion, bringing to 13 the number of people killed in political violence since Saturday, police said. The violence struck as <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> prepared to act as host at a meeting of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> foreign ministers next week prior to two meetings of Latin American presidents. In <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, rebels threw a dynamite bomb onto the tin roof of a lunchroom in a public market where policemen were eating. The explosion ripped open the roof and shattered the small restaurant's counter and lunch tables Police said rebel assassins killed <PERSON> Flavio </PERSON> <PERSON> Llerena </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>'s deputy administrative chief, and an unidentified man accompanying him as they walked along a street in the major Andean city 140 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> Rebels killed four policemen Sunday night in an attack on the police post in <LOCATION> Palpa </LOCATION> 42 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Ica </LOCATION>, the desert town 185 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> where the presidents of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> are to meet on Oct. 11. Police at the post drove away the attackers, killing two rebels, police said. In Ica the same night, Shining Path gunmen broke into the house of <PERSON> Oswaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspilcueta </PERSON>, a state university rector, and killed his wife, police said. They said the rebels apparently were after <PERSON> Aspilcueta </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s legal <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Shining Path split from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1970 and took up arms in 1980. It views party members as traitors to its dogmatic version of Maoism. Also on Sunday night, Shining Path rebels killed the deputy mayor of <LOCATION> Huamachuco </LOCATION>, a town in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Libertad </LOCATION> department 290 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. On Saturday guerrillas shot three people to death, two in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Negro </LOCATION>, 160 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, and one on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After chants of `` <PERSON> Allahu </PERSON> akbar!'' echoed in the cavernous Royal <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, the audience was told passages from `` The Satanic Verses'' would be read aloud and those who could n't take it had two minutes to leave No one stirred. Then a tall man with a white beard and skullcap took the podium and fired the latest salvo in the year-long Moslem campaign against the novel and its author, <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. In a worldwide effort to suppress a novel they consider blasphemous, Moslems have rioted, burned books, gone to court and threatened to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. The author, born a Moslem in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, now lives in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Many who condemn him have turned to <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Deedat </PERSON>, a 72-year-old Moslem scholar from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> with a simple message: Read the book. It may be a painful experience, <PERSON> Deedat </PERSON> says, but Moslems who know what the novel says have a much better chance of convincing Westerners their cause is just. He does not feel the blasphemy argument will convince Westerners `` The Satanic Verses'' should be suppressed, but he believes they would be more responsive if they knew what the book says about <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and the West in general. To prove his point, he regaled the 6,000 Moslems in the Royal <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> on Sunday afternoon with four-letter words extracted from the 547-page novel. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> is abusing his adopted country, <PERSON> Deedat </PERSON> declared, so the Moslem argument should go like this: `` Admitted that <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> has many filthy, dirty and obscene things to say about Islam and its heroes and heroines; but sir, do you know what he has to say about you, his benefactors and protectors?'' <PERSON> Deedat </PERSON> has an engaging, folksy manner and the voice and vigor of a man half his age. He argues cogently, in simple language, and has a keen eye for Western hypocrisies. Citing a newspaper report about <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> lawmakers demanding that American actor <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rourke </PERSON> be barred from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for using a four-letter word to describe Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s policies, <PERSON> Deedat </PERSON> expressed confidence they would feel the same about <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. Applause greeted his presentation, but at least one listener spotted an apparent flaw and expressed it during question time. The young man said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would not ban the book, however insulting, because its `` people are tolerant.'' Another troubling matter for questioners was the death sentence imposed on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> by <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the Iranian revolutionary patriarch who died in June. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> went into hiding after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> issued his declaration Feb. 14. Deedat deflected questions on that subject, saying it required an entire two-hour lecture by itself. In an interview afterward, he said the death threat had become a political issue: `` One group wants to take a certain stand which is against another group. I'm not interested in groupings. I'm interested in the best way to solve a problem. To many questioners, the problem was how to interpret the death sentence. A young woman described hardships encountered at school because of her attempts to defend the Moslem attitude toward <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. Someone else suggested <PERSON> Deedat </PERSON> was in conflict with the Koran, the Moslem holy book, if he did not support killing <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. Sunday's gathering underscored contrasts in modern, multicultural <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>: Arabic chants of `` God is Great!'' in a hall built as a monument to the traditional British way of life; young men in jeans and T-shirts kneeling on the lawn at the foot of the ornate Albert Memorial across the road, praying to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>; stalls selling prayer mats, Korans, alcohol-free perfumes and cassettes of <PERSON> Deedat </PERSON>'s remarks It was a placid scene, but a Moslem weekly distributed Friday outside the <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> had expressed the undercurrent of unease. `` Peaceloving Moslems fear that a time shall come when the British public would begin to identify an average Moslem as a terrorist and feelings of hate could ruin the otherwise peaceful coexistence,'' it said.

 There is fresh, white lettering on the battered sign welcoming tourists to this ancient capital _ once visited by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Great </PERSON>, by <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Polo </PERSON>, by <PERSON> Tamerlaine </PERSON> and by hippies tramping through <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Now, the main square is filled with armed militiamen and an armored personnel carrier is parked 20 yards away. The square bristles with Kalashnikov rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, carried by militiamen who left the mujahedeen rebels to join the government. There has been no fighting for months. But residents of this northern town hate the unruly militiamen and say they smoke hashish, demand goods at half price and prey on people traveling after dusk. It is part of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s policy of giving weapons, money and local autonomy to those who leave the Pakistani-based rebel coalition that is trying to topple his government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Fear of the militias is not unique to <LOCATION> Balkh </LOCATION>. In the refugee center in <LOCATION> Mazar-e-Sharif </LOCATION>, a provincial capital 11 miles east of <LOCATION> Balkh </LOCATION>, 12 people said they were attacked by a government militia when they crossed the border from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. They said they lost watches, turbans, and cash. In <LOCATION> Balkh </LOCATION>, an officer in the local army garrison acknowledged the militias were beyond control and warned visitors to be out of town by 4 p.m. `` The roads just are n't safe after 5 o'clock,'' said taxi driver <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON>. `` The bandits stop you and take money, watches, sometimes the car itself.'' <LOCATION> Balkh </LOCATION>, one of history's crossroads, has seen conquerors before. But by the time of the 1978 revolution it was a backwater, a quiet camping site on the hippie trail to the subcontinent and the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Balkh </LOCATION>'s past reads like a who was who of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. In the 5th centrury B.C, it became the capital of the first Aryan empire, before they moved on to <LOCATION> Persia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The Greek historian <PERSON> Heroditus </PERSON> put <LOCATION> Balkh </LOCATION> in his chronicles. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> the Great paused long enough on a 4th century B.C. march to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to marry <PERSON> Roxane </PERSON>, the daughter of a local tribal chief. The Arab forces that arrived in 645 were so stunned by its beauty they called <LOCATION> Balkh </LOCATION>, `` mother of all cities.'' <PERSON> Ghengis </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> razed <LOCATION> Balkh </LOCATION> and put all residents to the sword in 1220. <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Polo </PERSON> visited the ruins in 1275, and <LOCATION> Tamerlane </LOCATION> crowned himself emperor in the rebuilt city in 1359. But those were <LOCATION> Balkh </LOCATION>'s last halcyon days. Centuries of fighting gave the city a bad name. So when the northern provinces became part of emerging <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1866, the new capital was put at <LOCATION> Mazar </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tamerlane </LOCATION>'s massive mud brick walls melted like a sand castle, and much of the glorious mosque built in 1597 crumbled. But its blue-tiled dome and a triumphant arch in the circular, shady park at the town's center made it an idyllic spot for young Westerners tramping across <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was a main drug haven from 1970 to 1973, when the previous hashish capital of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> required all travelers to show a minimum $ 500 in cash. `` They were always stoned,'' said a toothless old man. `` But in those days, people smoked hashish secretly,'' the old man said. `` Now they do it openly.'' Did he mean the militia men swaggering nearby? `` Do n't ask me, I stay in the mosque,'' he said. Until seven months ago, when the Soviets withdrew their troops, the residents lived in fear of rocket attacks and fighting. No one is quite how many were killed on both sides, but residents think more than 1,000 people died. The road to <PERSON> Mazar </PERSON> was unsafe. Many of the surrounding wheat fields reverted to desert, their irrigation systems collapsed and their owners fled. The population of the area droped from 80,000 to 60,000. `` One or two years ago it was very dangerous here,'' said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Isar </PERSON>, who has sold boiled chickpeas in the park for 20 years. `` The opposition groups used to attack with rockets. Now that they have joined with the government, it is peaceful.'' Farmers have started cultivating again in the past year, but the town still has a menacing air. Militiamen roar around in trucks, raising streams of dust over the broad, unpaved streets. Voices drop when the townsmen talk about the militia. `` They take things or pay only half the money,'' whispered the chickpea seller. `` The people hate them.'' `` People are afraid of the militia, they do n't accept them,'' said <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadr </PERSON>, 30. `` They switch sides all the time.'' The only hotel was commandeered by a militia group that joined the government three years ago. At the edge of town a request to walk on the still massive remnants of <LOCATION> Tamerlane </LOCATION>'s walls is discouraged. `` There could be mines,'' the government escort said. No one expects tourists back soon.

 Many a face was red when a team of auxiliary firefighters taking part in an exhibition watched as the fire they were supposed to put out spread to a wider area, the national news agency reported. The firemen were showing off their skills Monday in response to an `` emergency'' during the launching of the Safety Month Campaign at the compound of the <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. But instead of applause, they got laughs. They had tried to extinguish several burning planks in a drum of gasoline but the blaze instead spread to a grassy area, the <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. This would not have occured had the firemen used foam instead of water, said a <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The firefighters finally managed to put out the fire when one removed the planks from the drum.

 The first reports from the new tabloid television wars are in, and `` A Current Affair'' and `` Hard Copy'' both have opened strongly while `` Inside Edition'' and `` USA Today on TV'' appear doomed. In this fall's jammed field of reality-based shows, other early casualties look to be `` Crimewatch Tonight,'' `` Trial by Jury'' and `` USA Today Weekend.'' According to the initial <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> ratings, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s nightly `` A Current Affair'' was the seventh most popular syndicated show at the start of the new television season. Finishing ahead of `` Entertainment Tonight'' and `` Donahue'' in the ratings, `` A Current Affair'' was seen in more than 6.9 million homes, the survey said. `` Every time a new show starts like ` Hard Copy,' ` Inside Edition' or ` Crimewatch Tonight' it becomes more competitive,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, co-executive producer of `` A Current Affair.'' `` But the strange thing ... is that when ` Inside Edition' started we never had better numbers. So far, in the first week against ` Hard Copy,' we've done the highest numbers we've ever done.'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said `` A Current Affair'' has attempted to fight off its challengers by trying to `` give more serious thought to the stories we do. You try to avoid doing the celebrity rip-offs and the easy <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; A shock-value stories.'' He said critics who blast `` A Current Affair's'' coverage of news and personalities as tawdry are n't fair to the show's intent. `` The worst kind of criticism that's written says that shows like ` A Current Affair' seek to horrify, shock and offend,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. `` Because if somebody shocks and horrifies and offends me on a regular basis, I'm going to turn off. And I wo n't let my kids to watch it, either. Because it debuted Sept. 18, `` Hard Copy'' was not included in the first Nielsen syndication report. But the news-oriented program, once entitled `` Tabloid,'' has performed strongly in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, according to its producers. Furthermore, `` Hard Copy'' consistently has boosted some stations' ratings from four months ago, the show's representatives say. In <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, for example, `` Hard Copy'' is delivering to WVIT an audience 60 percent larger than `` Win, Lose or Draw'' did in May. `` For a new show, we got off to a pretty solid start,'' says <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Monsky </PERSON>, executive producer of `` Hard Copy.'' `` We came off the blocks very quickly. Right now we have to prove to the people who did tune us in that what they got was just a little bit of what they could get.'' In its first few weeks on the air, `` Hard Copy'' has reported exclusives on <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and the death of her husband and the bombing of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> airliner over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. `` I think our intention is very clear. At the top of the show, we want to be very close to what's going on,'' <PERSON> Monsky </PERSON> said. `` And then we want to go deeper and deeper in trying to explore the widest possible range of the people involved.'' The top five shows in the syndicated market for the week ending Sept. 17 are, in order, `` Wheel of Fortune,'' `` Jeopardy,'' `` The <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> Show,'' `` The Cosby Show'' and the weekend version of `` Wheel of Fortune.'' `` Inside Edition'' finished at No. 22, `` USA Today'' landed at No. 32 and `` Crimewatch Tonight'' was No. 46. `` Trial by Jury'' was No. 62 and the weekend version of `` USA Today'' was No. 77. In one strange twist, the makers of `` Inside Edition'' have discussed the possibility of inviting celebrities on the show to rebut any distortions written about them in the supermarket tabloids. However `` Inside Edition'' is revamped, though, it seems likely it will be replaced by `` 30 Minutes.'' Producer <PERSON> Av </PERSON> <PERSON> Westin </PERSON>, a veteran of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, has joined `` Inside Edition'' maker King World Productions to create the new syndicated news magazine. New reality shows added to network schedules all have debuted poorly. Of the 81 shows covered in last week's regular Nielsen survey, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Primetime Live,'' hosted by <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, finished 49th. CBS' `` Rescue 911,'' with <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatner </PERSON>, landed in 55th. And CBS' `` Saturday Night With Connie Chung'' came in 71st.

 It had been almost a week, and 21-year-old <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>'s crying was done. But her mother, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, who had listened stoically to her daughter's account of rape by a policeman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, could contain herself no more. She sobbed when <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> described the soft-voiced rapist zipping up his pants and saying, `` Maybe that will make you want to collaborate.'' Allegations of mistreatment of prisoners have abounded since the rightist government of <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> took office June 1 and began to move against what they called `` guerrilla fronts'' _ public organizations that sympathize with or support guerrilla positions on some or many issues. The rebels, over the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s clandestine radio, called the police `` animals'' for the alleged rapes `` This is too much to stand for,'' they said. The insurgents warned that continued repression and rights abuse will endanger a preliminary peace process begun last month in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> with talks between government and guerrilla representatives. `` Just as we have been flexible and broadminded in order to negotiate, we are likewise completely disposed to, and capable of accompanying the struggle of the entire people, and to take hold of the flagpole of democracy and peace and carry it forward to drive it into the heart of those who only want war,'' said the rebel high command. Asked about the accusations, Maj. <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON>, head of the armed forces press committee, said: `` All commanders take pains to ensure that a prisoner's human rights are respected, because they know these people will come out of the police stations alleging this and that kind of abuse in order to make us look bad.'' In what they called a response to escalated repression, the guerrillas last week launched their first nationwide offensive since May. Seventy-eight people were killed or wounded in the combat, adding to the toll of a 10-year-old civil war that has taken 70,000 lives. It was visiting day at the women's prison six miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> sat outside next to <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> behind a backboard on the cement basketball court as she told her story. <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> is one of three women at <LOCATION> Ilopango </LOCATION> jail who say they were raped at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> headquarters after their arrest the night of Sept. 18 following a demonstration that turned violent. The National Federation of Salvadoran Workers sponsored the march, during which police were taunted by masked demonstrators wielding iron bars and two city buses were set afire. Authorities released 25 of 64 arrested demonstrators, but seven women and 32 men were held. Dr. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON>, a forensic specialist who examined 37 of the 39, found corroboration of the rape allegation only in Miss <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>'s case. The government and armed forces say prisoners like <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> are leftist guerrilla operatives masquerading as labor activists and that they invent accusations of torture and abuse to slander authorities. The workers federation, known as FENESTRAS by its Spanish initials, in fact espouses a political agenda identical to that of rebels who have waged war against a succession of U.S.-backed governments. But union and peasant organizations, as well as local and international rights groups, say the fact that an individual might support guerrilla positions does not strip him of the right not to be tortured, raped or summarily executed. <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON> found bruises, cuts and scrapes on 20 of those arrested after the Sept. 18 march. All said they were beaten during interrogation. All said their interrogators belabored them about alleged membership in guerrilla units and insisted they provide names of cohorts. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, in charge of the unionists' cases, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that many of the injuries could have been inflicted with billy clubs during the suspects' The New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, after a four-month study of justice in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said in a report this year, `` We have identified a pattern of psychological as well as physical abuse of detainees.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in its 1989 human rights report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>: `` Reports of abuse by arresting forces continue .... Instances of severe beatings, rape, choking, injection with drugs and electric shock were reported.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the allegations `` are extremely difficult to prove or disprove.'' <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> said that's because the judiciary depends entirely on the police forces for investigations. `` We receive many allegations of rape, but they never get anywhere,'' he said. `` In Miss <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>'s case, practically speaking, resolution would be impossible. She was blindfolded and can not identify the man. And the same National Police that are accused of committing the crime would be in charge of investigating it.'' He suggested creation of a police force responsible solely to the judiciary to avoid such conflicts of interest. `` Just having an investigative arm separate from the executive branch would be great progress,'' he said. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> were accused of raping and beating detainees after the April arrests of dozens of members of refugees organizations considered guerrilla fronts by authorities. Col. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, chief of the joint chiefs of staff, promised an investigation. After repeated requests by the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> reported that the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> had investigated itself and found no wrongdoing.

<HEAD>Another Construction Project Turns Into An Archaeological Dig</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After 16 years of haggling, a license was granted for widening a road next to the wall of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. But work was halted days later when a bulldozer uncovered a Byzantine bathhouse no one knew existed. It's a typical hazard for developers in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a city that dates back some 3,500 years and where a shovel put in the ground almost anywhere can turn up archaeological artifacts. `` We have an overload of history here,'' said <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Meir </PERSON>, a city archaeologist. `` That's what makes <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> different. If you do n't bother to check, you can simply bulldoze important findings away.'' <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> supervises the archaeological dig launched where construction crews have temporarily ceased building a 820-foot stretch of the new <LOCATION> Mamilla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>. The finds so far indicate that contrary to earlier belief, the roughly square-mile walled city may have once extended beyond the current walls, <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> said. The new road runs near the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION>, built by the Turkish ruler <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> the Magnificent in the 16th Century. Although long considered a possible archaeological site, the area was never excavated by researchers. For years, it was off limits as a battlefield or ceasefire zone between Israeli and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> armies. After <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured it and the rest of east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, other sections of the city were given priority by archaeologists. One example was `` King <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s City,'' near the holy <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aqsa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mosque </ORGANIZATION>, and the Wailing Wall remnant of the ancient Jewish temples. At the <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION>, excavators have dug more than 2,000 years into the past, stopping when they hit bedrock that indicated they had found the earliest settlement. Two structures so far uncovered _ a bathhouse and a large public building yet to be identified _ have been tentatively dated from the Byzantine period of the Roman Empire, or about the 4th century. Also discovered by <PERSON> Meir </PERSON>, helped by several dozen <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> laborers, is an intricate web of water cisterns, apparently part of an aqueduct system that supplied the ancient city's water. `` These may not look like stupendous finds, but they provide little important tidbits of information about what life was like. If we give up these little things, we would miss the larger picture,'' <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> said. As he spoke hundreds of vehicles crawled at a snail's pace above on the main road, which has been temporarily narrowed to two lanes. <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> said the planned road would likely be completed eventually, but the section adjacent to the dig may have to be diverted or lifted onto an overpass that would allow tourists to see the ancient ruins underneath. Under a city ordinance, contractors must sponsor an archaeological survey of any building site if historical relics are found during construction. Usually, a compromise is worked out so building can continue. The new road is part of a $ 250 million project to build a hotel, apartment buildings and a shopping plaza in <LOCATION> Mamilla </LOCATION>, a predominantly <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> quarter before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1948 independence war. Several plans for developing <LOCATION> Mamilla </LOCATION> have been shelved since 1973 amid huge disputes between planners and environmentalists. Among other complaints, the environmentalists expressed fears the new road could increase pollution, causing damage to old buildings. In the current project, a compromise was struck in which the planned road was narrowed from six to three lanes and several old structures were spared being leveled. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Karta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, developers of <LOCATION> Mamilla </LOCATION>, said they hoped the latest delay will not last beyond the end of the month so they can meet their building schedule. But they take it philosophically. `` In some places they make a fuss over remains only 100 years old, here we're talking about things dating to 2,000 years,'' said <PERSON> Karta </PERSON>'s deputy director, <PERSON> Yaacov </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>. The latest complication in the <LOCATION> Mamilla </LOCATION> plan is typical of what most building projects in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> have faced in the last two decades, ranging from housing developments in the Jewish Quarter of the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus on Mt. Scopus. Last year, preparations for a shopping mall were halted when excavators found two prehistoric farming villages from the Bronze Age at the city's southern outskirts. A compromise to allow building of the mall is reportedly being worked out.

<HEAD>Soviet Union: Nuclear Superpower With Third World Economy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is a nuclear superpower saddled with a Third World economy and that situation wo n't change any time soon, even with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform efforts, many Soviet experts believe. If anything, these analysts said, the Soviet economy is in worse shape now than when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> launched his perestroika, or restructuring program. He is facing the need to slash a huge budget deficit in half while at the same time coping with an economy which went into a nosedive in the spring even as inflation was heating up. `` The Soviet economy has fallen behind,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, an economics professor at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` When you take off the tight controls of a command system, you lose the threat over people and you get a drop in productivity unless you replace it with something else, like market incentives.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic troubles were the subject of discussions which took place in conjunction with the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> meetings a week ago between Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. One of the officials at that meeting, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoellick </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> aide to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, will be traveling to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> from Oct. 7-11 for continued discussions on the Soviet economy. Officials said the Soviets are studying a wide variety of ideas such as restoring faith in the Russian ruble by backing the currency with gold. The fact that the Soviets are calling for advice from <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, a disciple of anti-communist philosopher Ayn Rand, has not gone unnoticed as a sign of how intent <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is in introducing change. An official from the central bank of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Gosbank </LOCATION>, attended the annual meetings this year of the 152-nation <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has said it would like to join the two international lending agencies, a move that would make the Soviets eligible for economic assistance of the type already being received by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, two communist countries already in the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. While officials of both organizations stressed that they do not have any formal application from the Soviets before them, they did not dismiss out of hand the idea of Soviet membership down the road. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinberg </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based research group, said he believes that integrating the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other Eastern European countries into the world economy could be a central purpose for the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in the next decade. The two organizations, formed 44 years ago, originally had the mission of rebuilding the war-torn economies of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Feinberg </PERSON> said full membership for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> probably will not occur for three to four years, given the need to iron out such problems as opening the historically secret Soviet economy to greater review by foreign banking experts. But <PERSON> Feinberg </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> could begin sooner to provide policy assistance to the Soviets. `` The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> possesses expertise in the areas in which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> badly needs guidance _ money and banking, price reform and exchange and trade relations,'' he said. Many experts believe that the economic assistance program currently being developed for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and its new Solidarity-led government could serve as a blueprint for helping the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But officials say it would be wrong to underestimate the enormity of the task in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We should n't be looking for miracles. There is no panacea for the Soviet economy,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelzman </PERSON>, an economics professor at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He said the basic problem is that the Soviet society has no memory of how a market-based economy works. `` You can bring in foreigners, but that is not the same as having local entrepreneurs to call on,'' he said. `` The Soviets have had 67 years with no business class.'' <PERSON> Pelzman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will be forced to begin building up a foreign debt in order to import consumer goods as a way of demonstrating to a skeptical public that his economic policies can produce benefits for ordinary citizens. `` If he can stock the stores, he has bought himself a couple of years. But if he ca n't satisfy local consumers, then he is out of luck,'' <PERSON> Pelzman </PERSON> said. `` The opposition will move in and say <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program is not working.''

<TEXT>
 Rescue crews freed six sperm whales that beached on Prince <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON>'s north-shore national park, but one of the huge sea mammals died. As a crowd of hundreds watched Sunday, federal fisheries officers sent divers to tie slings, one at a time, around the tails of the creatures, which ranged in length from about 40 to 65 feet. A jet-ski took the line to a waiting <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> boat, which then towed each whale out about 300 feet then tried to keep it from returning to the beach by circling it. The shoreside crowd let out a rousing cheer as the first surviving whale blew a high spout of water upon reaching the open ocean. Fisheries officers said they believed the dead whale drowned. It was not known what caused the whales to become trapped between two sandbars, but a fisheries spokesman said one possibility was that the sound of a jackhammer working on a nearby bridge might have attracted them. Whales have been known to beach themselves trying to answer the distress calls from other beached whales. The beaching was reported early Sunday. Covehead is near the eastern end of the national park between <PERSON> Brackley </PERSON> and Dalvay beaches.

<TEXT>
 Suddenly, newly aggressive Democrats on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> are trying to paint President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into a corner labeled `` timid.'' Democrats are displaying a greater willingness to challenge the adequacy of the president's policies and to spell out stronger _ and generally more expensive _ Democratic alternatives. Led by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, Democrats are spelling out an alternative <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> agenda on issue after issue while portraying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s programs as inadequate, his funding proposals anemic and his entire approach as unacceptably `` timid.'' The effort is leaving Republicans grumbling that they are being whipsawed in a political bidding war in which `` one-upsmanship'' is the principal weapon. Although the signs have been building, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the national Democratic chairman, appeared to fire the starting gun last week when he told fellow Democrats it was time `` to start taking on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Accusing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of `` timidly following the prevailing winds'' of announcing ambitious programs and lofty goals without providing the means to pay for them, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> called on the president to begin `` matching his actions to his charming words.'' In <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and many other Democrats have been challenging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on nearly identical grounds and in very specific terms. Recent examples: _ Democrats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> demanded sharply increased aid for helping non-communist forces build democracy in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, billions of dollars beyond the $ 218 million <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to spread over three years Deputy Democratic Leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> calls the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> approach `` pathetically timid.'' _ Democrats, challenging the adequacy of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s commitment to the war on drugs, led a successful fight to boost spending by $ 1.1 billion, earmarking most of the additional money for prevention and treatment _ <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> is leading a new Democratic drive to spell out a plan to improve the quality of American education, to take the luster from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s claim to be `` the education president,'' and to underscore the historic <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> contribution to public education _ The majority leader has named a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> task force to chart ways to broaden housing opportunities, address the problems of the homeless and highlight Republican scandals in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> _ Democrats are battling <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bid to reduce capital gains taxes They want to revive Individual Retirement Accounts to help average Americans save for education, housing and retirement. `` There's going to be a lot more of that kind of thing,'' says Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>. `` We're not just going to be standing around waiting for the president to act. `` You are going to find a more active, more aggressive party in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said. `` You may see us move even before the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> does.'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> and many other congressional Democrats say there is a distinct advantage in having a coherent position on as many issues as possible in order to build up bargaining chips in negotiations with the White House. And some Democrats are fearful of being bruised if the effort results in a head-to-head confrontation with a president pledged not to raise taxes. There is a lot of political gamesmanship in all of this. Some Republicans say the name of that game is, `` me-too, only more so.'' `` It's clear they've decided that the honeymoon is over with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and that they need a way to counteract his popularity,'' says an adviser to a senior <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican. `` And the only thing they can come up with is, ` be tougher, be more aggressive, take shots at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.''' `` It's a do-more-then-they-are strategy, a one-upsmanship strategy,'' he said. `` As we see it, the hidden agenda is to somehow make <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> raise taxes.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who has been majority leader for only nine months, has been under increasing pressure by other Democrats to get out in front on policy matters, to become far less timid himself in confronting the president. As his apprenticeship ends, he is clearly attempting exactly that.

The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Banking, <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is examining the relationship between nominee <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Clymer </PERSON>'s suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> accounting firm and an economic development organization nearby, according to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aides who spoke only on condition of anonymity. The organization, the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, is the subject of a broad audit by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said in an interview Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel unanimously backed <PERSON> Clymer </PERSON>'s nomination on Sept. 8, but has since put a `` hold'' on sending it for a vote for the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Clymer </PERSON>, 42, is the former vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UMTA </ORGANIZATION> assists state and local governments in improving mass transportation systems. He has declined requests to be interviewed about the matter. The local partnership, which has received $ 500,000 in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grants in the past year, was founded in 1983 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON>, R-Pa., who has said he is not involved in its daily affairs The congressman ordered a consultant to investigate the partnership earlier this year when it was disclosed that several of <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON>'s campaign supporters had received no-bid contracts Of particular interest to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel are no-bid contracts that the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Inquirer reported were awarded to <PERSON> Clymer </PERSON>'s firm by the partnership to audit its books <PERSON> Clymer </PERSON> has been <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON>'s campaign treasurer in the last three elections. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunleavy </PERSON>, the consultant retained at <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON>'s request, said in his report to <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> that this year's contract given <PERSON> Clymer </PERSON>'s firm was properly bid However, the <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Dunleavy </PERSON> said that previous year's contracts with <PERSON> Clymer </PERSON>'s firm were not awarded through competitive procurement policies required by the federal government. The newspaper said federal money was used. In his report to <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON>, which has been made public, <PERSON> Dunleavy </PERSON> also said the partnership misspent $ 125,000 in federal funds on ineligible items such as a promotion film and advertising. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Tancredi </PERSON>, a top official of the partnership, resigned in July after coming under fire for his handling of the organization's finances. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, the inspector general, said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> was conducting a general audit of the partnership that was `` not limited in any way, shape or form.'' <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> was doing another audit in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> when `` a combination of things occurred concurrently'' that convinced it of the need to look into the partnership, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. He declined to be more specific.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> says it's taken care of a Catch-22 situation in which its broadcasts to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> were disturbed by a radio station run by U.S.-backed rebels. But Rep. <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON>, D-Calif., says he wants to know exactly what happened this summer when `` The <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cockerel </ORGANIZATION>,'' a station experts say was set up by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, interrupted Portuguese-language broadcasts by the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>, the U.S.-government-supported station that serves overseas listeners <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on international operations, said last week he'll raise the issue in panel hearings this year. `` I wrote a letter of protest about it,'' he said. `` The need is great for the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> to have at this time unhindered and unhampered access to its consumers in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON> said in a letter. The problem with the broadcasts is an outgrowth of the conflict in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> where the rebels headed by <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> are battling the Soviet-backed government in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, who is visiting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this week, receives American government money to finance his group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> operates the black cockerel resistance station, which <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, said is a `` CIA-supported clandestine radio station.'' Initial reports, first published in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> last month, said the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> station blocked 12 minutes of an Aug. 18 <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> broadcast that included four minutes of a speech by Angolan President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the parent agency of <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials do not believe the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> station intentionally fouled <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts. `` We do n't consider it jamming,'' he said. But the two stations used frequencies that were close to each other so the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> listener could hear the rebel station's broadcasts at the end of the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> program. `` You could hear their signature. It sounds like a rooster crowing,'' he said. To eliminate confusion, <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> changed frequencies, he said. <PERSON> Jardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Muekalia </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, denied the rebels interfered with the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts. But he charged that <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>'s reporter in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> had prepared biased reports designed to imply the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> favored the Angolan government. <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> has dismissed the notion the reporter is not objective. `` We have been pleased with what he has done. We have not seen any bias,'' he said.

<HEAD>GI Bill Running out for Vietnam-era Veterans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> era veterans who want to take advantage of the GI <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> to further their educations will soon run out of luck. The GI bill program that covers people who served during <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ends Dec. 31. A new GI bill has taken its place, but only the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans who remained on active duty from June 1985 through June 1988 may benefit. According to Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., 250,000 veterans are affected Many are GIs who stayed in the military but left before the end of June 1988. Although legislative efforts have been made to extend the benefits, neither veterans' committee in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is taking up the measures. `` It's a damn shame this is going to come to an end and is going to hurt so many <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans who have made the military a career,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> of the 35,000-member <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> VVA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of the Non-Commissioned Officers' Association, argue that the veterans being squeezed out of the programs are the ones who `` carried'' the military during the 1970s, when it was plagued by low enlistment and low morale. The 153,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, representing career enlisted personnel in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, has urged an extension of benefits. Neither of the two major veterans' groups, the American Legion or the Veterans of Foreign Wars, spoke out on the issue in a recent <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee hearing on the GI bill. Rep. G.V. `` Sonny'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, opposes extending benefits under the so-called `` Cold War'' GI bill. The <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Democrat says the bill is too costly, unnecessary to help veterans readjust 14 years after the war, and unneeded for a group of people who had already made a career choice _ for the military. `` It's time to move on to a new bill designed to recruit and retrain rather than just reintegrate,'' said committee spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Holley </PERSON>. The GI bill that expires Dec. 31 followed the Korean War GI bill and the pioneering World War II GI bill. There was also a Veterans' Educational Assistance Program for people who enlisted from 1977 to 1985. The program offered a maximum benefit of $ 225 monthly and was based entirely on the enlistees' contributions. The <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> era bill is the most used, having served 8.1 million veterans, compared with 7.8 million for the World War II program. The <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> bill, with no contributions, pays a maximum $ 376 million monthly benefit to full-time students with no dependents. The maximum eligibility is 45 months. The Veterans' Affairs Department said in February that 750,000 people were eligible for benefits under the Vietnam-era bill and 60,000 were currently enrolled. The new program relies partly on pay deductions from recruits. It pays $ 250 to $ 300 a month for up to three years, reflecting the three years of active duty required for eligibility. A person is eligible for up to 10 years after discharge. Those who entered the service during <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> could take advantage of the new program if they served three years of active duty starting June 30, 1985, when the bill took effect. The <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> vets were not required to make further contributions. But <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of the 160,000-member <ORGANIZATION> NCO </ORGANIZATION> group said the service regulations force many career non-commissioned officers to retire, and many lost eligibility because they had to quit before the end of June 1988.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> says he regarded his mentor, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, `` almost as a god'' even though <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> had an ego that sometimes got him into political trouble. In fact, the 33rd president says about the 32nd, <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s ego was a factor which compelled him to break a tradition as old as the republic and run for a third and fourth terms. <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> discusses his boss in a posthumous book, `` Where the Buck Stops,'' to be published late this month by <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. It is edited by his daughter, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, who says her father wanted its publication withheld until after he and wife <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> were dead so that he could be completely candid. The book gives <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s assessment of <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> as a strong leader but weak administrator and as a president whose ego sometimes led him to mistakes. He cites one big example: <ORGANIZATION> FDR </ORGANIZATION>'s `` court-packing'' plan of 1937. <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> wanted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to give him the power to enlarge the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which had been striking down one New Deal program after another. <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> writes that he supported <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s plan out of his knowledge from history that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had changed the number of justices over the years. But <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> says <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s ego led him to overestimate his power and led to the most severe setback of his presidency. `` I did n't agree at all with <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s obvious feeling that he had become so popular and so powerful that he could go ahead and push through anything, even an unprecedented plan like that one, without help and without bothering to try to convince people opposed to the plan that he was right,'' <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> writes. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lost a bill that might have been very helpful to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people because <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s ego misinformed him and made him believe he could win on his own.'' <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> also says that he was troubled when <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> decided in 1940 to ignore the two-term tradition and seek a third term. He agreed with <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> that the threat of war made it the wrong time to change leaders, but he says FDR was motivated by the belief he was the only person in the country capable of leading it. `` I thought there might have been a partially wrong reason involved: that he was n't doing it only because he felt it was best to keep the same experienced man in place, but that he might also have felt that he was the only possible man who could lead our country to victory in the war,'' <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> writes. At another point, <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> says, `` I guess that was his principal defect, that growing ego of his, which probably was n't too minuscule to start with, though perhaps it was his only flaw.'' For all that, <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> says he admired Roosevelt enormously. He cites his record in fighting both the Depression and the war, and asks: `` Is n't that enough to make us think of him almost as a god?'' `` He was a very, very pleasant man and a great conversationalist,'' he writes, `` with marvelous flashes of humor in almost everything he said, and he had a personality that made people feel close to him.'' <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> also pictures <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> as `` a first-rate executive, never afraid to make those decisions he made'' but a weak administrator `` because he just was n't able to delegate authority to anybody else.'' He said, `` I was always of the opinion that he ought to have restraints, as every president should have, and I sometimes argued with him myself when he wanted to go too far or when he set out to do something strictly on his own and without the agreement or help of others.'' Historians have written that <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> were not close and <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> did not keep his vice president informed, despite his failing health. FDR died early in his fourth term without even telling <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> about the atom bomb. <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> accepted <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> as his running mate in 1944 after becoming wary of Vice President <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>'s left-wing inclinations. <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, a senator from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, was widely respected for thoroughgoing investigations he had conducted into wasteful war contracts.

<HEAD>Democrats Say They Have Senate Votes to Kill Capital Gains Cut</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democratic leaders claim they have the votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to kill President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s capital gains tax cut but concede a watered-down version may get through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> predicted Sunday that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> probably will vote this week to repeal the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> catastrophic health care coverage that it enacted only last year. `` I hope personally that the program is retained on a modified form,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' program `` But ... there are a great number of Republicans and some Democrats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> who are in favor of repeal. If I were guessing today, I think it probably would be repealed.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, also appearing on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, likened the House-passed version of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s cut in capital gains taxes to the cocaine-based drug crack and said flatly that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will not enact it. `` It is so bad, so wrong for the economy,'' he said. `` It will do for the deficit what crack does for the user: a quick short high followed by a long, painful depression.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plans this week to consider an alternative proposed by Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and endorsed by a majority of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> which would instead restore partial tax deductibility for contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts. In other congressional action this week: _ The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will take up a long-awaited bill to protect the nation's waterways from oil spills similar to the Exxon-Valdez tanker accident in March that dumped 10 million gallons of crude into <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> _ Negotiations continue between <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees on a dozen appropriations bills needed to finance government programs in fiscal 1990, which began Sunday A major sticking point is how much the government will spend on Star Wars in fiscal 1990: The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has appropriated $ 3.7 billion but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> wants to spend only $ 3.1 billion. _ Competing child care measures, both targeted primarily to low-income families but one with the potential of being expanded to eventually subsidize day care for the middle class as well, will be considered by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations subcommittee on employment and housing continues its investigation into scandals at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> with a return appearance by self-described influence-peddler <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said Sunday he is positive that the 27-month capital gains tax cut approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last week will not win passage in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. However, he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` irresponsible position ... makes it extremely difficult to prevent any tax cut from occurring.'' The House-passed measure would reduce from 33 percent to 19.6 percent the maximum tax rate on profits from the sale of stocks and other investments until 1992. The rate would then climb back up to 28 percent with assets indexed so that any gains attributed to inflation after that point would not be taxed. Economists predict the cut will generate some $ 9.4 billion in deficit-reduction revenues over the next three years. After then, revenue would fall and worsen the deficit by a total of $ 21 billion over the following five years, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Taxation. `` I'm confident that this so-called yo-yo _ on two years, off two years _ and the way in which it's constructed can not pass,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> acknowledged that many Democrats favor enacting a differential for taxing such profits at rates less than those for wages, interest or dividends. `` Whether or not they will coalesce behind any plan along with Republicans, I do n't know,'' he said. `` It will be very close on some other plan.'' Regarding catastrophic health care, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he is confident the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will retain key benefits under the program, although it may change how they are financed. The administration has opposed changing or repealing the program. The wealthier among the 33 million elderly Americans covered by the program have balked at having to pay premiums this year of up to $ 800 to cover the hospital and physicians' bills for those with lower incomes. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> likely will not complete action by an Oct. 16 deadline on a deficit-reduction bill, which would include any tax measure or changes in catastrophic care coverage. That is the date when broad spending cuts in both military and domestic programs will be triggered automatically unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> comes up with $ 6 billion in new revenues or programs for fiscal 1990. `` We might have some few days in which there would be a technical sequestration, that is an across-the-board cutting through executive order of all the accounts ...,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think that's going to be a permanent situation.''

<HEAD>House Members Doubt Senate Rationale on Star Wars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Supporters of Star Wars believe the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> strengthened its hand in negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by restoring funds for the missile shield, but <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members are casting doubt on that rationale. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> slashed $ 900 million from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s fiscal 1990 request of $ 4.9 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> last Tuesday, then came back two days later and restored two-thirds of the money. What transpired in 48 hours were proclamations that the initial vote signaled the demise of the program, formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, introduced six years ago by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a nuclear-age antidote to a strike against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. There also was a negotiating session between <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees thrashing out the defense authorization bill in which confident <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members argued that the true <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Star Wars number was the $ 3.7 billion adopted Tuesday in the appropriations bill, not the $ 4.5 billion the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved last month in authorization legislation. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which had agreed to $ 3.1 billion for the program, wanted a final figure closer to their total. Faced with that argument, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, took his case to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for a stronger negotiating position He succeeded by a narrow margin, 53-47. Despite the win, lawmakers stressed that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would n't be fooled by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> reversal. Shortly after the second vote, some Star Wars opponents said so in no uncertain terms. `` It tells you about the depth of their feelings,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Colo </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and one of the conferees `` Those kind of flip-flops do n't make the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> look very serious,'' she added. But on Friday some senators argued that they did nothing to fool the House. `` We're on record as supporting a higher number,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> signaled it did not want a significant cut.'' He added: `` There's nothing for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to see through.'' While the authorizers enter their fifth week of negotiations on their respective defense plans, the appropriators are scheduled to begin in another two weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions of the appropriations bills differ greatly on the major strategic weapons such as Star Wars, the B-2 stealth bomber and land-based nuclear missiles. The two blueprints also include different funding totals for the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' V-22 Osprey, the vertical-takeoff plane, and the F-14D Tomcat jet fighter. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had sought to cancel the two conventional programs. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> slashed $ 1.1 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighter </ORGANIZATION> plane while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> cut $ 1.8 billion earmarked for the Trident 2 nuclear missile, the submarine-launched weapons that has had two successive test failures.

<HEAD>Bank's Contractors Get Blindside Hit from IRS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALINAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of independent contractors for a bank are being scrutinized by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which thinks they earned thousands of dollars every time they washed a window or turned a screw. A computer at <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> multiplied the earnings of contractors, maintenance workers, lawyers and other professionals by 100 before passing the information on to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Salinas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Californian </ORGANIZATION> reported in its editions Saturday. And the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, eager to collect Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>'s cut of the phantom windfall, has written to the contractors, demanding explanations for the discrepancies between the <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> reports and the recipients' 1987 tax returns. `` I was panicked. They moved the decimal point two places to the right,'' said real estate appraiser <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuelson </PERSON>. `` They're in quite a snit about it. <PERSON> Samuelson </PERSON>, who says he made $ 2,400 from <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION>, was listed in <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> files as earning $ 240,000. There could be hundreds of such errors, said <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON> spokeswoman. The bank acknowledged the number may be higher but said the most people who could be listed wrongly would be 25,000 _ the capacity of the suspect computer. `` It probably shook a lot of people up,'' said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Samuelson </PERSON>'s tax adviser, who has discussed the error with <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> officials. The San Francisco-based bank, with 640 branches throughout the state, hires about 2 million people each year on a contract basis, said spokesman <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellog </PERSON>. The inflated income reports have been tentatively traced to one of <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION>'s many computers that handle <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> Form 1099, which is submitted for all non-employees who perform more than $ 600 worth of work for the company. The cause of the malfunction remains unknown. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said taxpayers called to account for non-existent income should be able to prove the bank's figures were inaccurate but could face a large amount of paperwork. But <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said that any problems in setting the record straight should be minimal. `` It's just a couple of additional zeroes,'' he said. `` It's not a problem for the taxpayer. We send out hundreds of thousands of letters like those, and it's not unusual to have some problems.''

 Nearly 500 couples who thought they had been divorced for years will find out they failed to finish what they started. The <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clerk </ORGANIZATION>'s office discovered the incomplete cases, some as old as a decade, during a purge last month of old files. Judges and clerks said the legal lapses came about in most cases because couples or their lawyers simply neglected to file final divorce papers. `` What if one of us just won the $ 50 million lottery and thought we were divorced?'' asked <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Roed </PERSON>, 52, who recently found out he still was married to <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>. He thought they were divorced in 1983. `` There would be a big financial situation.'' Others who remarried have to legalize their current marriage by filing the missing divorce documents, officials said. In most cases, a judge will then approve the filing. Court clerks were preparing to send out notices to the couples involved in the unresolved cases.

<HEAD>More Children Locked in Poverty, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Millions of children, particularly blacks and <PERSON> Hispanics </PERSON>, are being launched on `` courses of failure'' because they live in poverty, says a congressional report that warns there appears little prospect for improvement. Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., said the report released Sunday paints a `` disturbing'' portrait of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children, many of whom never benefited from the economic expansion of the 1980s under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` We're launching millions of children on courses of failure,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who heads a committee on families. Most disturbing, he said, is that `` I really see very little that holds out the prospect that this will change. ... The prospect is that those incomes are going to stagnate.'' Neither the White House nor <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been willing to put enough resources into social programs to give families the support they need so children can grow up well-fed, healthy and educated enough to participate in the economy, he said. However, Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bliley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., ranking Republican on the panel, took issue with the chairman's conclusion that the federal government, under a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> president, has ignored the problem <PERSON> Bliley </PERSON> said the net that is keeping so many children in poverty was not cast by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> but is the result of social forces that are breaking up families and sexual behaviors that are leading more girls to become teenage mothers. `` We have known for two decades that single parenthood is a prescription for poverty, regardless of race,'' <PERSON> Bliley </PERSON> said. `` How you solve these problems I really do n't know.'' <PERSON> Bliley </PERSON> agreed with <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was not likely to vote more money for social programs overall. `` You can always use more money, but I do n't see it there with the budget crunch we're in,'' he said. The 300-page report by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> and Families compiles statistics from a variety of sources. The figures show that children are the poorest segment of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population. In 1987, nearly 21 percent of children under age 18 and more than 22 percent of children under age 6 lived in families with incomes below the poverty line, compared with 12 percent of the elderly and 14 percent of people of all ages. The childhood poverty rate rose from 15 percent in 1970 to more than 18 percent in 1980 and more than 22 percent in 1983 before dropping to 20.5 percent in 1986. Poverty has been more persistent for black and Hispanic children, for whom the rates have risen since 1970. In 1987, more than 48 percent of black children and nearly 42 percent of Hispanic children lived in poverty. In 1988, 71 percent of children were living with two parents, while about 24 percent were living with only their mother or father. In 1981, about 74 percent were living with both parents and about 20 percent were living with a single parent. About 42 percent of children in 1986 were living with two working parents, while 29 percent were in two-parent families where only the father worked. About 15 percent lived with one parent who was in the labor force and about 8 percent were in single-parent homes where the parent was unemployed.

 There's a body, evidence, and a suspect. But <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> authorities ca n't agree who should investigate the death of a former women's collegiate basketball star. The body of <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON>, who played basketball at <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was found June 11 in a ditch near <LOCATION> Forrest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, about 25 miles from the state line. But she may have died in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. `` I'm wondering if they are thinking of her as a nobody,'' said <PERSON> Marliss </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hammond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, who last saw her daughter when she came home for Mother's Day. `` Had <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> been some prominent person's daughter ... would it have made a difference then? Was <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> just another black child?'' Authorities in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, contend Ms. <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON>, 24, was slain in a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> apartment and her body then dumped in the ditch beside <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 70, halfway between <LOCATION> Forrest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. `` We have simply pursued all the leads that we have, and everything to us points back to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>,'' said Sheriff <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkman </PERSON>, who forwarded the case file to police in the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> city in August. `` We just can not resolve a murder here in this county that happened someplace else.'' But Capt. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> East </PERSON>, commander of the Memphis homicide division, said he is n't about to take over the investigation. `` It is his case, it has been his case and it will continue to be his case,'' East said. `` Unless it can be proved that a homicide occurred here, which it can not be proved at this time, then it stays where it is found.'' The discovery of Ms. <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON>' badly decomposed body came a little more than two years after the body of her best friend and former teammate, 18-year-old <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Spicer </PERSON>, was found in a trash bin on the <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, college campus. Both women were strangled. Ms. <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON>' boyfriend, <PERSON> Ivrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON>, who shared a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> apartment with her until her disappearance in May, is a prime suspect in the <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON> case, <PERSON> Parkman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON> was acquitted of second-degree murder in the 1987 death of Ms. <PERSON> Spicer </PERSON>, with Ms. <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON> testifying on his behalf. On May 19, he reported to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> police that Ms. <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON> was missing and that he last saw her the previous day, when he dropped her off for work as an assistant manager at a Lady Foot Locker shoe store. But Ms. <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON>' boss told police the young woman never showed up for work that day. Shortly after Ms. <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON>' disappearance, <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON> was questioned by <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> police, but he since has left <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and was last reported living in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Parkman </PERSON> said investigators have learned Ms. <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON> argued the day she disappeared. But <PERSON> Parkman </PERSON> said he never questioned <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON>. `` I think <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON> should be interviewed,'' <PERSON> Parkman </PERSON> said. `` But I do n't think we have enough to do that in this county. I do n't think we have enough evidence and information on <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON> to initiate picking him up.'' <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON> declined comment recently, saying, `` I know my name is being bounced around a lot up there, but my attorney has advised me not to say anything.'' <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials know Ms. <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON> was dead when her body was dumped in the ditch, <PERSON> Parkman </PERSON> said. They also have learned <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON> owned rose-colored sheets like the ones found wrapped around her body, and crime lab reports indicate fibers found on the sheets and on Ms. <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON>' clothing matched carpet fibers in the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> apartment, <PERSON> Parkman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Parkman </PERSON> also said police have established a motive, but he would not disclose it. <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> chief of detectives <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> said his department wo n't take the case unless there's conclusive evidence the crime occurred in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. He denied the mother's implication that authorities are dragging their feet because Ms. <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON> was black. Ninety percent of the people killed in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> this year were black, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said, and 91.8 percent of homicides were solved.

 This battered city paused from cleanup labors Sunday to thank the volunteers from all over the country who answered the call for help in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo. `` What you're doing will never be forgotten,'' Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> told several hundred weary workers who gathered at a noon rally. `` People from all over the country came to help a community in need. We might have suffered some damage, but our spirit is alive.'' The mayor read several letters of support from children and other well-wishers from across the land. One envelope from former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> included a check from $ 1,000. Officials said 63 buildings collapsed in the historic city when <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> crashed ashore and more than 350 were severely damaged by the hurricane's 135 mph wind. Volunteers flooded into town to remove trees, clear debris and pitch in to help people in need. Sen. <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, an outspoken critic of the response by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, praised the volunteer laborers for their efforts. `` They did n't wait to fill out a form like the bureaucrats in the federal government ask you to. They came up here free of charge and volunteered,'' said <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, wearing a T-shirt that read: `` <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, We're Going Strong!'' `` This country's great if we can get the federal government off its duff,'' he said. `` We're going back to work to get around the bureaucratic snarl.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, a spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, defended <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts Sunday. `` <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> is providing everything the state of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> needs. We're talking about one of the most devastating storms in recent history. It's being done,'' he said. However, the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, joined critics of <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>'s effort. `` People do not need more bureaucracy _ they need more direct help right now,'' he said. The volunteers were treated to a hot lunch of stir-fried chicken dished up by the <ORGANIZATION> Outer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. A canvas canopy donated by the <ORGANIZATION> Sturh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funeral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> protected the food from an intermittent drizzle. But it was more like a revival than a funeral and at one point volunteers standing in mud sang `` God Bless America'' over the hum of portable generators. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Desin </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, arrived Wednesday after 187 days working on the Alaskan oil spill in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. His company, <ORGANIZATION> Cheetah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, sent four large vessels to ferry food, clothing and medicine to people on the offshore barrier islands pummeled by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>. `` These people need help,'' said <PERSON> Desin </PERSON>. `` This is what makes this country what it is. You can kick our butts, but we'll fight back.'' <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, sent 19 police officers to help <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> with traffic and curfew control. `` These people have been kicked in the teeth. Would n't you help someone where they're down?'' said Capt. L.E. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, Sheriff's Department. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, sent 28 men plus a squadron of trucks, backhoes and heavy equipment. `` The hurricane could have hit us,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Carbone </PERSON>, 33. `` This country's always sending help to other countries. This is a way to help our own.'' Elsewhere Sunday, in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s upstate region, heavy rain overflowed already swollen rivers and closed some roads. Ten <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> disaster application centers were open Sunday, with four more scheduled to open Monday, officials said. As of Sunday, 5,400 residents had applied for various forms of federal and state assistance. Seventeen counties issued food stamps to people who suffered property damage or income losses. Officials said Saturday that $ 10 million in food stamps had been issued to more than 50,000 residents since Thursday. Normally, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> issues $ 13 million in food stamps over an entire month. In <LOCATION> Bishopville </LOCATION>, three <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> had to be sent in to restore order when pushing and shouting broke out among people who had been waiting for hours in a food stamp line. No arrests were made, officials said.

 It took Hurricane Hugo six hours to roar across <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, lashing the state with wind, rain and flood. Officials ending a week of cleanup say those few hours will be felt for years. The storm smashed the state's economy, throwing thousands out of work. It devastated timberlands, farmlands and coastal areas, damaging everything from tourist havens to shrimp beds. The genteel face of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> has been scarred and muddied. `` It's not going to be a quick process, it is going to be hard for all of us,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the mayor of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, where more than 2,500 historically significant buildings were damaged. The repairs to those building will take five years. The immediate effects are obvious. Eleven days after <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> bore the brunt of the storm, thousands of people remain without electricity, and an estimated 50,000 are homeless. Cleanup efforts are costing the state a half-million dollars daily. State Comptroller General <PERSON> Earle </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> has estimated Hugo could put the state budget $ 300 million in the red in the next fiscal year, partly due to losses in revenue from fallen payroll and property taxes. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s 135 mph winds and 17-foot tidal surge also altered the state's employment picture. An estimated 270,000 people were thrown out of work for at least the short term, raising the state's normally low unemployment rate of 4.5 percent to more than 16 percent `` It's across the board,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Philips </PERSON>, a program supervisor with the state <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have everything from manufacturing plants to hardware stores affected. The weather does n't discriminate.'' <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> said it was hoped many shops and businesses would reopen soon, but the state's important lumber and fishing industries may take three years to recover. Dozens of shrimp boats were beached and damaged by the storm, which struck during one of the best harvests in recent years. State officials say shrimp beds appear to have escaped major damage, but producers were hit hard. `` The biggest thing is people who buy the shrimp _ the packing houses _ they're all wiped out,'' said <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> McClellanville </LOCATION> shrimper for 21 years. Of greater concern is the damage to forests, which provide the raw materials for a $ 4.3 billion wood products industry that employs 30,000 people. It is estimated 36 percent of the 12.2 million acres of state forest was damaged, felling trees worth more than $ 1 billion. Put in perspective, about 2.2 billion board feet of timber are harvested annually. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s destruction downed 6.7 billion board feet. `` We hope to salvage what we can, but there's three years of harvest on the ground,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a state forester. `` We see a major reforestation problem. After all, how do you get that many acres back in production?'' The tourist industry, a $ 4 billion business that employs 98,000 people, is expected to bounce back quickly despite $ 2 billion in damage. But <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Liming </PERSON>, state director of tourism, said damage to such resorts as <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and Garden City would drop growth from an anticipated 8 percent to less than 3 percent this year. <PERSON> Liming </PERSON> said key to bringing tourists back is a quick rebuilding program to dispel notions that the coast remains in tatters. `` Some people are assuming that <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> is gone and that's a wrong assumption,'' he said `` A remarkable amount of property has already gotten back on line, but some heavy rental areas are going to be a long time coming back.'' The storm laid waste to as much as $ 100 million worth of cotton, soybean, corn and tobacco in the major agriculture areas in the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and the northeast part of the state. While the damage will be gone with next year's row crops, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Clemson </ORGANIZATION> agricultural economist, said the effects will take its toll on those who raise poultry, hogs and dairy cattle. `` Those losses will be much greater,'' he said. `` We're talking about a longer term recovery period that will see some farmers sell out.'' Perhaps most worrisome is <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s impact on the state's small businesses: the restaurants, shops and small manufacturers without the resources to survive weeks and months of down time. `` The number of businesses coming into the disaster assistance centers is far greater than we expected,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, district director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` We will probably be seeing effects of this for the next 10 years.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Houston-based company specializing in catastrophe management, said the longer it takes businesses to get on their feet, the greater the risk they face of closing. `` Probably 40 percent of businesses wo n't reopen,'' he said. `` That's pretty significant when you consider that these are largely mom and pop operations that have been in business for years and years.''

 <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, who as a candidate in the 1988 presidential election brought conservative ideas back to Mexican politics, died in an auto accident in his native <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> state. He was 55. Thousands of supporters marched through the streets of the state capital, <LOCATION> Culiacan </LOCATION>, late Sunday carrying the blue-and-white flags of his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with a black-bow ribbon sewed on one corner as a sign of mourning. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, about 200 supporters gathered around the Angel of Independence monument holding signs that read, `` Thank you, Maquio,'' <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>'s nickname. <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> and political colleague <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON> <PERSON> Manriquez </PERSON> died Sunday when the car they were in crashed head on into a truck loaded with papayas, police said. The accident occurred halfway between <LOCATION> Culiacan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> beach resort of <LOCATION> Mazatlan </LOCATION>. A police news bulletin said the driver of the truck, <PERSON> Aurelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, was detained for questioning. When he died, <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> was stumping the state to help <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> mayoral candidates running in Oct. 15 balloting. Friends, political foes and former business associates mourned the burly, white-bearded politician who finished third in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 1988 election, which was won by President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> and marred by fraud <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, on a one-week visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, telephoned his condolences to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders, the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibarra </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Piedra </PERSON>, a leading human rights activist, called <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>'s death `` a great loss for the political fight in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' `` He was a strong, courageous man of very defined political ideology. But I learned to appreciate him as a Mexican struggling to open the way of democracy for the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Heberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, a socialist political foe, told reporters. <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> gained wide popularity after the 1988 campaign for his denunciations of election fraud and criticisms of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has held power in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since its founding in 1929. Conservative politics had been frowned upon since the overthrow of dictator <PERSON> Porfirio </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> in the Mexican Revolution. Conservative parties like <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> were discredited until <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, angered by former President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON>'s expropriation of private banks in 1982, entered politics `` <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON> turned me into a politician when he did that. I saw the power and the rigidity of the presidential system and I decided to struggle to change that,'' a friend quoted <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> sold most of his investments in industrial companies and dedicated himself to truck farming and politics. He managed to unify his fractious party into a political force and rally <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s splintered conservatives. He ran for <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> governor in 1986 but lost to the governing party candidate in balloting also allegedly marred by fraud. <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, whose family has lived in <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> for more than a century, was born in <LOCATION> Culiacan </LOCATION> on June 13, 1934. An agricultural engineer by profession, he headed leading business organizations for more than two decades. <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> studied at the <ORGANIZATION> Technological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, graduating with a degree in agronomy and botany. He taught biology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinaloa </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Priest Defies Archbishop Over Dress Code for Church</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A priest has told parishioners he wo n't back down from enforcing a dress code despite orders from the archdiocese that communion is for anyone, even those who wear shorts to services. Some people among the 80-member congregation are rallying behind the Rev. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Griese </PERSON>, who has preached at <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sacred </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> for 21 years. `` I do n't think there is one person in our congregation that does n't go along with a person going to church ... looking like a person going to church,'' said <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertran </PERSON>, 61. Church officials said that while dress codes are permissable, it is the practice of the church worldwide not to deny communion on the basis of dress. For about 20 years, the parish has had a dress code that bans shorts, miniskirts and halter tops. This summer, <PERSON> Griese </PERSON> posted signs throughout the church as a reminder. Ms. <PERSON> Bertran </PERSON> said the rules have been bent for people who ca n't afford dress clothes `` We do n't mind polo shirts, because sometimes that's all they've got,'' she said. `` By and large it seems that the atmosphere of the parish seems to be very supportive of father,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Acanfora </PERSON>, an occasional churchgoer. `` I certainly am.'' Others, however, oppose the dress code. `` No one should be denied communion,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON>, 54, who attends the church but is not a member. `` If he denies communion to people, how do we know if we're going to be denied the last sacrament when we die? I think the church should be more interested in saving souls than how people dress.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON>, 33, was turned away by <PERSON> Griese </PERSON> twice on consecutive Sundays in September when he came to church wearing shorts. The next Sunday, <PERSON> Griese </PERSON> served him communion after <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> appeared in trousers and a dress shirt. `` It is people like him across this world that drive Catholics away from the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> said. `` My faith was taken away from me by not giving me communion for two Sundays in a row for wearing shorts. ... That tells me he's judging me based on what I wear.'' <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrado </PERSON>, 20, said she learned of <PERSON> Griese </PERSON>'s enforcement of the code in July when she and a boy friend went to Mass. She said she was wearing knee-length black shorts and a silk blouse with a collar. Her boy friend was wearing shorts. `` In front of the entire church, he says, ` Get out of my church. You're not welcomed here,''' Ms. <PERSON> Corrado </PERSON> said. `` I could n't believe he was saying this. Of course, everybody was staring at us.'' The couple left. Archbishop <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON>, whose Cincinnati-based archdiocese includes the church, wrote <PERSON> Griese </PERSON> in September that the code should not be enforced to the extent of refusing communion. `` I have indicated this to you and pointed out that in the future you may not refuse Holy Communion or absolution in the Sacrament of Penance purely on the grounds of inappropriate dress,'' <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, an archdiocese spokesman, declined to say what sanctions <PERSON> Griese </PERSON> might face if he continues to refuse communion to shabby dressers. <PERSON> Griese </PERSON>, 73, told his congregration last month he had been threatened with suspension but would n't back down. `` I'm at peace with God as to what I've done and how I've done it,'' <PERSON> Griese </PERSON> said. `` And if that does n't please the archbishop, then I'm very sorry. But I have to follow my conscience.'' He did not return phone calls to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Bertran </PERSON> said <PERSON> Griese </PERSON>'s manner of enforcing the dress code is part of his `` abrupt'' manner. `` That's his personality,'' she said. `` You have to understand father, and if you were a parishioner you would know that.''

 This <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll is based on telephone interviews Sept. 14-24 with 1,071 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Phone numbers were selected randomly and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that 19 of 20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if every adult American were asked the same questions. The error margin is larger for subgroups. There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fayyad </PERSON> has repaired his shell-battered west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> pharmacy but has n't removed the sandbags, reflecting the skepticism most Lebanese feel about peace talks under way in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. `` I'm back in business,'' <PERSON> Fayyad </PERSON>, a Druse Moslem, said Sunday. `` But I have no faith in the ability of those people in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>.'' An Arab League-brokered cease-fire that ended six months of remorseless shelling battles between Christian and <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> forces has held for eight days. But the daily crackle of automatic weapons along <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, a daily ritual for so many years no one considers it a violation, is a reminder of how volatile <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is Many Lebanese, who have seen hundreds of cease-fires collapse since the civil war began in 1975, consider this one nothing more than a respite in a conflict that has defied the peacemakers. Peace, they believe, is still far off. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hajj </PERSON>, a Christian taxi driver in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, does not believe the aging Lebanese legislators trying to hammer out a settlement in the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> resort of Taif will be able to come up with the magic formula that has eluded everyone else. Quoting an Arabic saying, he said `` they're just cooking a stone soup _ It's something that ca n't be cooked.'' <PERSON> Hajj </PERSON>, 38, said: `` These people have been members of parliament since 1972 and they have n't been able to do anything to stop the war. Why should we expect them to be magicians now?'' `` The best we can hope for from the Taif talks is an agreement on vaguely worded general principles,'' said columnist <PERSON> Emile </PERSON> <PERSON> Khoury </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> who writes for the respected independent An-Nahar daily based in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` Parliamentary subcommittees will be set up to negotiate the details and mechanisms to translate these general principles into reality, a process which will take many, many months,'' he said. Even then, many Lebanese believe, there are too many fighters with a vested interest in perpetuating the conflict to make a final settlement attainable. Although <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is one of the few constitutional institutions to have surivived the civil war there is a general consensus that it is helpless to influence the warlords and foreign powers who have kept the war going. `` These men have no influence at all on the gunmen who fought the war,'' said <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Koosh </PERSON>, 38, a Sunni Moslem and professional wrestler. The current parliament was elected for a four-year term in 1972, three years before the war broke out. The fighting prevented general elections and the legislators in the 99-seat House have simply voted themselves a new mandate periodically since then. The main Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militias, who have accrued wide power during the fighting that has fragmented <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> into sectarian cantons, as well as the splintered <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> army, have no representatives among the 73 surviving <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members, many of whom are in their 70s. Moslem militia chieftains like <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Druse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> movement, both have denounced the political reforms being debated in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> as meaningless. `` If <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> or <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> veto any resolutions taken in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, who's going to be able to implement them? Koosh asked. Many people believe <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is incapable of disbanding the militias, a move essential to ending the war. Yet despite the gloom, many Beirutis say they will use the current lull to get their businesses going again after the six months of shelling, some of the fiercest of the war. `` I'm going to repair my shop and resume business and I hope this lull lasts long enough for me to make up my losses,'' said <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahine </PERSON>, whose electrical tools shop in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s low-income <LOCATION> Dora </LOCATION> district was gutted The Lebanese despair is rooted in the failure of every peace effort that has been made, in too many years of fighting that has killed more than 150,000 people, displaced another 1 million and ruined the economy. But there are some optimists.

 A bomb exploded outside the police station of a small town 20 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, heavily damaging the town center and slightly injuring three people, police said. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the blast late Sunday in <LOCATION> Randalstown </LOCATION>, but suspicion inevitably fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is fighting British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> police headquarters said in a statement that the injured were two civilians and a police officer. Police said the bomb exploded as police officers were evacuating scores of families from their homes in the area following a telephoned warning by an anonymous caller. They said the attackers put the 500-pound bomb in a hijacked van, then left the vehicle outside the police station, which like many police stations in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is fortified against bomb attacks and manned only part-time. The building, unoccupied at the time, was extensively damaged while dozens of nearby homes, shops and offices were wrecked, police said. They said only the prompt action of the security forces in evacuating homes had prevented a major disaster. The mainly Roman Catholic <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> wants to unite the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the mainly <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> under socialist rule.

<HEAD>Americans Back Tax Hike to Help War on Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans overwhelmingly favor an increase in `` sin taxes'' to help fund President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s war on drugs, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll. The poll also found that many preferred treatment of drug users to punishment, and expressed doubt that more prisons will help. And many doubted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan will succeed: Among the 61 percent who called drug abuse the nation's most important problem, barely more than a third expected the problem to ease during the next decade. Nearly one-third of all respondents knew someone who uses cocaine. But most said drug abuse is not a serious problem in their own neighborhoods, and just one-seventh rated it `` very serious'' where they live. The poll, conducted Sept. 14-24 among 1,071 Americans, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed a $ 7.9 billion program to fight illegal drugs, saying they are `` sapping our strength as a nation.'' Seventy percent of the money is earmarked for law enforcement, the rest for education and treatment. In the poll, though, six in 10 said providing treatment for drug users would accomplish more than punishing them. And 57 percent said building more federal prison cells for drug offenders _ as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants _ wo n't help. Sixty-five percent believed boosting military and law-enforcement aid to cocaine-exporting countries would help reduce drug abuse. But the highest levels of support were for greater federal spending on drug treatment, with 80 percent in favor, and education, with 91 percent in favor. Respondents were split on whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan spends enough money, too little or too much. Nearly half wanted anti-drug money taken from other programs, while a third favored raising taxes. The rest were unsure. Though taxes were generally unpopular, three-quarters said they would support raising cigarette or alcoholic beverage taxes to pay for a bigger drug program, and seven in 10 supported a 1 percent increase in corporate income taxes. Another funding scheme had less support: By 53-43 percent, respondents opposed a 1 percent increase in personal income taxes. The number of people calling drug abuse the nation's greatest problem has risen steadily in opinion polls as the issue gained increasing attention. While most rank it the No. 1 problem nationally, however, just 14 percent reported a `` very serious'' drug problem where they live. An additional 26 percent rated the problem `` somewhat serious'' in their neighborhoods. The larger share _ about six in 10 _ rated their local drug problem as `` not too'' or `` not at all'' serious. Big-city dwellers were most concerned, with half saying illegal drugs posed a serious problem in their neighborhoods. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that roughly 8 million Americans have used cocaine during the past year and 1 million of them use it at least once a week. In the Media General-AP survey, 31 percent said they know someone who uses cocaine or its derivative, crack. Half of them, or about one-seventh of all respondents, said they know an addict. Younger people were more likely to know a cocaine user; 48 percent of those age 18-29 said they did. Black respondents and big-city residents also were more likely to know a cocaine user. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last month called on Americans who know drug abusers to help them stop. But the poll showed the difficulty of that approach: Of those who knew current cocaine users, nearly six in 10 said they already have tried to get them off drugs. The poll found overwhelming objection to buying or selling marijuana or cocaine. The greatest tolerance was for growing marijuana for personal use, which 26 percent called unobjectionable. Respondents split sharply on law enforcement priorities, dividing about evenly on whether the best line of attack is against drug producers, dealers or users. They favored some new punishment schemes for occasional users, with 82 percent saying people caught with drugs in their cars should have their licenses suspended and 63 percent saying the cars should be confiscated. People were split about evenly on the notion of sending occasional drug users to military-style boot camps as punishment. Eight in 10 said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should order the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces to patrol the borders for smugglers. But only 43 percent said he should order military strikes against illegal drug operations in foreign countries. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, The Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar ended marginally lower against the Japanese yen at the end of Monday trading, while the key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> erased earlier gains and inched down. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 13.79 points, or 0.04 percent, ending at 35,622.97. It shed 53.22 points on Friday. Dealers said the index rose earlier when market players were reassured by <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Itsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nomura </PERSON>'s victory over his Socialist rival in a by-election for a seat in the less-powerful upper house of Parliament Sunday However, the index started falling as participants sold issues for profit-taking, partly fearful of the recent rapid rise in share prices, they said. In currency dealings, the dollar ended at 139.30 yen, down 0.05 yen from last Friday's close of 139.35 yen. It opened lower at 138.77 yen, and moved between 138.65 yen and 139.48 yen. The dollar passed the 139-yen mark shortly after the market opened, as participants bought the currency for profit-taking, but trading became mixed afterwards, traders said. The dollar's downtrend was further prompted by the the governing party's victory in the by-election and dollar-selling by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> last week, said one trader with a major commercial Japanese bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
 A young East German woman screamed, `` We made it, we made it,'' as she sobbed with happiness, squeezed into a throng of hundreds of other refugees arriving in this northern Bavarian city. The refugees, many with small children in tow, looked tired but still showed nearly unbounded joy as crowds of West Germans welcomed them after their overnight journey to the West. <PERSON> Elke </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebecke </PERSON>, her 12-year-old son <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and 3-year-old daughter <PERSON> Christine </PERSON>, tried to push through the refugees and well-wishers on the train platform. `` My husband managed to make it across through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> three weeks ago, but we did n't go,'' the 32-year-old woman said, her eyes wet with tears. Mrs. <PERSON> Ebecke </PERSON>, from the <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> area, was on the second train packed with East German refugees that arrived from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` My husband does n't even know we're here yet,'' she said. <PERSON> Annamarie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON>, 52, told of how Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> announced late Saturday to refugees at <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s embassy in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> that they would be permitted to go West. `` I was just walking by in the embassy garden when he said it. Such a cheer went up from all the people. It was unbelievable,'' she said. `` I had applied three times in two years to leave for the West, but they turned me down each time. I went to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, because I thought this was my only chance.'' The refugees formed long lines at public telephones in the train station to call families in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or relatives in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Outside the station, many refugees picked out donated clothing stacked high on yellow railway carts. Most had arrived with just one or two canvas bags packed with their belongings. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, police and railway workers mingled with the crowd, many smiling and chatting. Some handed out hot drinks, bananas and bowls of soup to the refugees. At a table in the train station snack bar sat 21-year-old <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Monique </PERSON>, 19. <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, a cook, and his wife, a waitress, said they were fed up with harsh political conditions at home. `` They -LRB- Communist authorities -RRB- control everything you do,'' <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> said. `` We applied to go to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> on vacation, but they turned us down. We did n't need permission to go to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, so we went to the embassy and joined the others, hoping to get out.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> said, `` You ca n't get ahead over there -LRB- in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-. You always have the feeling you are being watched. You are afraid to discuss anything with your friends.'' She said the East German news media `` lie and try to tell us the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> just wants to make slaves of us. They really think we're so stupid we do n't know better.'' East German news media have claimed that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is luring East Germans as a source of cheap labor. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Shutz </PERSON>, an auto mechanic, said East German authorities `` try to control everything we do. The young are tired of putting up with that. It's a dictatorship. All I can say is I'm happy to be here ... If I work hard over here I know I can get ahead.'' <PERSON> Shutz </PERSON> was asked why he and other refugees turned down an earlier East German offer of travel to the West within six months on condition they first leave the embassy in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and return home. `` There are n't many people who would fall for something like that,'' he said. <PERSON> Uwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Thuemmel </PERSON>, a 30-year-old East German truck driver, said he had planned to take advantage of that offer and had traveled to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Plauen </LOCATION>, near the Czechoslovak border. `` I left my wife and family at home, thinking I would be back in three days. But then <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>'s announcement came, so I decided to leave without my family,'' he said. `` I hope they'll be able to follow me.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> did n't do his case much good when he repeatedly testified that he did n't remember details of his ministry's finances, his lawyer says. `` That was a pretty heavy cross-examination,'' defense attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s appearance on the stand last week. `` It was very damaging, very devastating.'' The 82-year-old defense lawyer added: `` It did n't have anything to do with the issues, but ...'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy, was scheduled to return to the stand today for more cross-examination. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury could get the case by the end of the week. He is accused of diverting most of the $ 158 million in donations he raised to build lodging at his religious retreat and theme park, and using some of the funds to support a lavish life for himself and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>. In last week's testimony, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> denied defrauding anyone, repeatedly saying he had worked hard to keep the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> dream alive. Yet he often appeared to be off-guard, particularly as prosecutors delved into details of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s offers to provide free lodging at his <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> theme park in exchange for contributions. Under three hours of cross-examination, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> answered `` I do n't remember'' or its equivalent more than three dozen times. In several instances, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he had told viewers on his television shows that some changes would be made in the lodging programs at issue in the case. But he was unable to say when he had made the announcements, despite having access to the same videotapes as prosecutors. `` There are so many dates,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, laughing, said at one point. In his initial testimony, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told jurors that when he left <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987, he had built, was building or had plans for accommodations for more than 211,000 so-called lifetime partners _ the name given followers who gave $ 1,000 or more in return for promises of three nights lodging each year for life. More than 150,000 lifetime partnerships were sold between January 1984 and May 1987, including 66,000 in the Heritage Grand Hotel, where <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had said only 25,000 would be sold, and 74,000 in the still-unfinished Towers hotel, where <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had said only 30,000 would be sold. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> attempted to show jurors a chart of the various hotels, lodges, bunkhouses, chalets and campsites he said could have accommodated the 211,000 partners. But prosecutors objected that the chart contained information that was not in evidence and was misleading. Later, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> flatly accused former employees of either lying or making errors in saying he had ordered diversions of money and the destruction of corporate records. Even documented evidence met resistance from <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. When prosecutors tried to use PTL records to show <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had reopened partnerships after they had been overbooked, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he did not recall doing that. He also denied signing several letters and memos, except for two on which the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had found his palm print. Shown a 1986 memo ordering bonuses to two <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> employees, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said, `` That's what it said,'' but added, `` I did not do this.''

 Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> marked its 40th anniversary with fireworks displays and dances on Tiananmen Square, which thousands of police patrolled to ensure the celebrations would not be disrupted. Thousands of police mingled with the 130,000 performers, and residential areas around the square were cordoned off hours before Sunday's show. Only people with passes were allowed to enter. A million people joined anniversary events around a tightly guarded <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Sunday. Along city streets, potted flowers were arranged in designs that praised socialism and the Communist Party. The highlight was the nationally televised 3 -LCB- - hour dance and fireworks display on Tiananmen Square The symbolic seat of power in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the square has been under military guard since troops on June 3-4 put down the pro-democracy movement, killing hundreds of unarmed civilians. Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, 85, watched the performance from the Tiananmen Gate rostrum above a huge portrait of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>. From the same spot, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> declared the founding of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 1, 1949 Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and 84-year-old <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>, an ideological hard-liner who rarely appears in public, joined <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>. Western ambassadors boycotted the show to demonstrate continued concern over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s suppression of dissent and most foreign guests were from socialist countries such as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The most prominent American to sit with the leaders was former Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, now a private businessmen. He is in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for a business symposium. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> as telling North Korean Politburo member <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> Ok that the spring political turmoil `` was bad, but in the final analysis it is beneficial to us, because it made us more sober-minded.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, said that because of the spread of Western ideas before the military crackdown, `` for a period of time some of our ideological front was lost.'' But he said now `` social order has returned to normal.'' Despite frequent assertions that all is normal in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the city remains under martial law and security was extremely tight around <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. Police and troops, some armed with rifles, patrolled city streets. Those who danced on the square and other places were carefully selected for their political reliability and non-participation in the spring demonstrations. Some offices and factories provided cash bonuses for employees who volunteered to dance on the anniversary. The government led up to the national day with television and radio and press reports about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s achievements over the past four decades in developing industry and agriculture, and caring for its 1.1 billion people. There has been little mention of the political and economic upheavals under <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule. Reports have been couched within the central theme that only socialism can save <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and only the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is qualified to rule the nation. `` There is no doubt that the socialist system is superior to the capitalist system,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial.

 <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer and music critic whose career spanned more than half a century, has died at age 92. <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, who had been in failing health for a long time, died in his sleep early Saturday in his room at <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> where he had lived almost 50 years, said his secretary, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> won the Pulitzer Prize for music for his score to the documentary film `` <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Story </LOCATION>,'' in 1949 _ the only time the Pulitzer has been awarded for a movie score. `` The death of <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> T </PERSON> is like the death of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> city: it is intolerable,'' said composer-conductor <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> was loving and harsh, generous and mordant, simple but cynical, son of the hymnal yet highly sophisticated. ... `` But he will always remain brightly alive in the history of music, if only for the extraordinary influence his witty and simplistic music had on his colleagues.'' <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>'s long career included orchestral and choral works as well as incidental music for plays by authors from Shakespeare to <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> <PERSON> Capote </PERSON>. In 1988, <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> was one of 12 recipients of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, an award created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> four years earlier at the suggestion of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Born in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> began to play piano at age 5 and, as a teen-ager, worked as a church organist. In 1922, he graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and moved to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where he was among a group of young American musicians such as <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Copland </PERSON> to study with <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulanger </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, he also met the iconoclastic composer <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Satie </PERSON>, who was a great influence on him. While in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, he met <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> and wrote one of his most famous works, the opera `` Four Saints in Three Acts,'' with her as librettist in 1928. It premiered in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, in 1934 and had a short but successful run on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. He settled in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1940 and joined the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, where he was music critic until 1954. In 1982, he won a National Book Critics Circle Award for `` A Virgil Thomson Reader.'' <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>'s latest book, `` Music with Words,'' is to be released officially Oct. 18 by <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> described it as a `` how-to book for composers, people who are interested in setting words to music or music to words.'' In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> before his 90th birthday, the cherubic, white-haired <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> said, `` I've got nothing wrong with me except I'm deaf and overweight. You do n't die from those.'' <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> said the hearing problem kept him from enjoying musical performances more than 10 years ago, but he continued to compose and kept busy on the lecture circuit. He recalled that his first Tribune music review said violinist <PERSON> Jascha </PERSON> <PERSON> Heifetz </PERSON> played `` silk underwear music,'' but joked that when some other critic is unkind about his own music, `` I'm convinced the writer is an ignorant pipsqueak and probably in the pay of my enemies.'' <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, who never married, is survived by a niece, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Stouffer </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Longwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. He will be buried in a family plot in <LOCATION> Slater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. A memorial service is planned at the Cathedral of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> the Divine in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Nov. 25 _ what would have been <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>'s 93rd birthday.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index fell back from its record high morning close today, and the dollar declined against the Japanese yen for the sixth consecutive trading day. The dollar closed at 139.30 yen, down 0.05 yen from last Friday's 139.35-yen finish. It opened at 138.77 yen and moved between 138.65 yen and 139.48 yen. The dollar now has fallen 5.70 yen in six days. Market players, reassured by the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s parliamentary by-election victory on Sunday, tended to buy the yen in early trading, said <PERSON> Minori </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` But the dollar rose afterward in mixed trading, mainly for technical position adjustments,'' she said. She added that market players were reluctant to buy the dollar at the 139.50-yen level for fear of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> intervention. The central bank has been selling dollars over the last week to check the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's recent rise. The amount of selling was unknown, and the bank does not comment on its exchange market activities. On the stock exchange, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> lost 13.79 points, or 0.04 percent, ending at 35,622.97. In early trading, it had climbed to 35,701.33, its highest ever morning closing. The index had shed 53.22 points on Friday. The Liberal Democrats' by-election victory also prompted the index's early gain, said <PERSON> Masahiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Umemori </PERSON>, a stock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` But the index started falling later mainly because participants became afraid of recent rapid rises in share prices,'' he said, noting the index's 500-point gain last week. `` Afternoon trading was directionless, too,'' he said. A rumor that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> might raise its interest rates soon also discouraged investors, <PERSON> Umemori </PERSON> said. `` The rumor even said there might be a coordinated interest rate hike in a few countries,'' he added, without elaboration. Trading was moderate, with first section volume estimated at 750 million shares, down from 900 million last Friday. Electrical issues such as <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> and Pioneer and steel issues were losers.

<HEAD>Florida Becomes Fifth State to Ban Dropouts From Driving</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has joined the growing list of states that withhold driver's licenses from high-school dropouts, but teachers are n't sure the change will improve education or just keep bad students in school. The law, which took effect Sunday, drew praise from some educators as an attention-grabbing way to cut the dropout rate. `` I believe this is an excellent tool for parents to use to encourage their students to remain in school,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Castor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> commissioner of education. But others say the law could create a bureaucratic nightmare and just might cause discipline problems by keeping reluctant students in the classroom. `` There may be more children who will be in school. But they do n't want to be in there and they may become problems in the classroom,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cariseo </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION>. `` Sometimes these children just do n't care.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> broke ground last year with a law requiring teen-agers to stay in school to keep their driving privileges. <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> followed suit, and dozens of similar bills are pending in legislatures around the country. Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sangmeister </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., has introduced legislation to make such a ban nationwide The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law says students must stay in school or an eligible program _ such as a course for a high school equivalency test or a training program _ or the license will be suspended until age 18. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> estimates 9,200 students will decide to stay in school in order to keep driving. Because the law also limits unexcused absences _ 11 in a row or 20 for the year _ supporters of the law say attendance might improve for perhaps 62,000 students. Nearly 30,000 drop out every year in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The report card on similar laws in other states is mixed. `` It's so new that I do n't think anybody really knows all the effects,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secondary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principals </ORGANIZATION>. `` A lot of people simply think it's too broad. Through February, 1,809 dropouts returned to school in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, but 48 percent of them then left school a second time, said <PERSON> Therese </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, acting director of state educational support services. More than 780 teen-agers' licenses have been revoked under the law, she said. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, schools across the state must certify in writing that each student meets the attendance rules when they apply for driver's licenses. Teen-agers become eligible to drive at age 16. Many <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> school administrators anticipate the law will bring a deluge of paperwork that could clog up the system, Ms. <PERSON> Cariseo </PERSON> said. `` Every child has got to get these forms,'' Ms. <PERSON> Cariseo </PERSON> said. `` I think the main problem is going to be keeping up with that and notifying the <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> once they drop out.'' Castor, the education commissioner, plans to ask the Legislature for $ 5.8 million to cover administrative costs, with the funds to come from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s lottery. Backers say the law will back up parents' warnings about the danger of dropping out. `` It's hard to tell a student he'll have a lower-paying job when he's 30 and have him listen,'' said education department spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Voss </PERSON>. `` When a parent says ` You ca n't drive any more,' it's immediate.

<TEXT>
 Opposition politicians are backing efforts by <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' followers to bring his body home as part of an apparent scramble to receive the mantel of leadership of the late's president's following. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> died Thursday in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where he had lived since his ouster in the popular uprising three years ago that propelled <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> into the presidency. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has banned the return of the former leader's body, citing national security. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters today asked the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn the ban. Political analysts expect that with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' death, his <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> will break up because it lacks leaders of national prominence. The fact that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> designated no clear-cut successor will intensify efforts by major politicians to win the support of his constituency. Sen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, an Aquino supporter, predicted a `` massive regrouping of various forces, galvanized by the clamor to lift the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> ban.'' `` The <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> followers and sympathizers, having lost a prime mover, are now in search of a new leader who could unify and rally them into a strong, cohesive party,'' he said. Although <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' popular support had dwindled, he still enjoyed a large following among his 6 million fellow Ilocanos, a linguistic group in northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> is also believed to be well-financed and have a network of experienced political operatives nationwide. In congressional and regional elections since Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> took office in February 1986, the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> party has fared poorly, except in northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> and scattered parts of <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Visayas </LOCATION> islands. But Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s decision to ban <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' body is controversial, even among her supporters. Six pro-Aquino lawmakers in the 23-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> support his return. Opposition to the ban is also widespread in the 200-member House of Representatives. Pro-Marcos politicians see the issue as a means of winning broad-based sympathy in a culture which respects the right of the dead to be buried in their homeland. This explains the absence of massive public demonstrations in the wake of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' death. His supporters say they have decided for now to avoid large protests for fear violence would tarnish their image as an aggrieved party and ruin chances for the body's return. Politicians not identified as pro-Marcos see the issue as a means of currying support among his followers without being tainted with loyalist label. Chief among those angling for support in <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' camp include Vice President <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, both of whom are widely assumed to have ambitions of succeeding Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in the 1992 elections. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> says she will not run again. Laurel and <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, president and vice president of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Nacionalista </ORGANIZATION> party, quickly endorsed the return of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' body. On Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> called a press conference to announce the planned <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal even before it was confirmed by the petitioners. Previous attempts by <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> to forge an alliance with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' followers broke down because of the reluctance of the late president's supporters to break with their leader as long as he was alive. Laurel, once a leading anti-Marcos figure, began cultivating contacts with the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family soon after the former president was hospitalized in January. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> served as <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' defense minister and held the post under the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> administration until he was fired in November 1986 after a failed coup by his followers. Despite <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>'s role in the 1986 ouster of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, he remains an attractive figure for many loyalists because he is an Ilocano like their late leader. One major factor in the realignment will be the role of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' flamboyant and influential widow, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> Political analysts believe the ambitious <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> is exploiting Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s ban to promote her image as an underdog, a sympathetic figure in Philippine culture. `` If President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> insists on her ban from President <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> being brought here, the anger of the people might turn into pity for the -LRB- former -RRB- first lady and rally behind her,'' said <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Nalupta </PERSON>, mayor of the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> ancestral hometown, <LOCATION> Batac </LOCATION>. It is also unclear what role <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' only son, <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, will play. Analysts say the 32-year-old <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is too young to become the leader immediately but will wield considerable influence in determining the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>'s future. `` This is the end of an era,'' the younger <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said Sunday in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. `` And I find myself facing the awesome responsibility of trying to fill my father's shoes.''

 A teen-age father who's fighting a law that bars high-school dropouts from driving says such laws are probably a good idea _ there just has to be room for exceptions. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Means </PERSON>, 17, finds it tough to make ends meet since losing his license, but he does n't blame his lack of formal education. Rather, he says he had to quit his job pumping gasoline to because of the publicity over his court fight against the law that bars high school dropouts from driving. The experience left him bitter about the law. `` I think that the people, the judges and the governor, think they own everybody in the state, especially the younger people who it does n't matter what they say or do,'' Means said last week. `` Children should be seen but not heard _ I do n't think it's fair.'' Means' trouble began last fall when the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicles </ORGANIZATION> cited the new law in refusing to replace his lost license. The county school system later identified Means as a dropout, setting up a court test for the nation's first law barring dropouts from driving until they reach age 18. Despite his argument that he needed to drive to provide for his then-pregnant wife, a <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> judge last month refused to give him back his license. An appeal is planned as early as this week. Means, who left school at age 16, called Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakaib </PERSON>'s decision `` pretty stupid'' in his case but said the law is worth pursuing by other states `` It's a good law. It's good if kids go back to school,'' he said. `` But there should be exceptions. There has to be exceptions to everything.'' State education officials point to positive re-enrollment numbers and say they have been flooded with calls from virtually every state in the country seeking information on the law. Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sangmeister </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., has introduced legislation that would impose the dropout driver ban nationwide <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> have passed similar legislation. Through February, 1,809 dropouts returned to school in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and 48 percent of them then left school a second time, said <PERSON> Therese </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, acting director of state educational support services. More than 780 teen-agers' licenses have been revoked under the law, she said. Without a license, Means and his wife of a year were forced to move in with his parents, whose four-bedroom home already had two adults and three children. His 17-year-old wife, <PERSON> Tonya </PERSON>, also a dropout, said the situation puts a strain on the family. `` There's a time or two when his mom or dad or my mom will take us down and buy things for the baby that we do n't have money to get,'' she said. `` Parents can only stretch so far, especially when they get a family as big as theirs.'' Mean's father, <PERSON> William </PERSON>, supported his son's decision to quit school. `` If you can read and write and do arithmetic, that's the basics. That's all you really need to get by on.'' But the younger Means said he plans to make sure his son does n't drop out `` I do n't think I would like it,'' Means said. `` I'm going to keep him in school as much as possible. Means' immediate goal is to get a house and a job other than cutting lawns. He talks of starting a stoneworking business with his father. While the loss of his license made it tough for Means to get to his service station job, he said he had to quit the job because reporters covering the ground-breaking case made it impossible to work. `` They kept coming up to where I work with cameras and I had to work,'' Means said. `` I had to be on TV and I had to work. It was putting a strain on everybody.''

<TEXT>
 Former members of the Tiananmen Square democracy movement are urging Americans and `` peace-loving people all over the world'' to continue pressing for freedom in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Three former members of the pro-democracy movement led about 3,500 demonstrators Sunday to protest the 40th anniversary of communist rule in their homeland. The marchers walked in a downpour from the Lincoln Memorial to the Chinese Embassy here to protest the violent crackdown on the student democracy movement in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square. Nearly 2,000 other marchers demonstrated in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and hundreds marched in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` The Chinese government must stop killing,'' said <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON>, one of the three pro-democracy leaders, who fled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after the crackdown last summer. `` We appeal to peace-loving people all over the world to stand together with us and fight for a <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in which basic freedoms are guaranteed.'' Another of the three emigres, Wu'er Kaxi, told a small news conference outside the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> that `` the attitude of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people as well as that of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been clear since the events'' of the crackdown. Asked whether he had any specific criticisms or demands of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, he replied, `` No comment.'' Shen, Wu'er and the third leader, LiuYan, were in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a fast and protest. Police estimated the crowd of marchers at 3,500. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, 1,200 people shouted and waved signs outside the Chinese consulate in a noisy but peaceful protest against National Day, the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Protesters during the three-hour demonstration said four decades of communism had been a failure for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and blasted the Chinese government's repression of the pro-democracy movement. Many of the signs pledged to remember the `` martyrs'' of democracy, hundreds of students who were killed when troops fired on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square last June. Police reported no arrests or problems because of the protests. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, some 700 people gathered peacefully outside the Chinese consulate downtown waving human rights signs, singing peace songs and cheering speeches by university students, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> clergyman and community leaders. The crowd, mainly Chinese natives, formed a semicircle on the street in front of a military tank, two tents, a 5-foot Goddess of Liberty statue and a gray coffin, on which dozens of spectators placed white flowers. The <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> and Scholars sponsored the two-hour protest which included a re-enactment of the student massacre and a mock trial. <PERSON> Ting </PERSON> <PERSON> Huang </PERSON>, a computer engineer and native Chinese, donned a T-shirt with a picture of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, the 85-year-old senior leader in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The words above the photo stated `` Wanted for Murder.'' `` I'm here to protest continuing human rights violations in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, secret arrests and imprisonment,'' <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> said. On Oct. 1, 1949, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Zedong </PERSON> declared the founding of the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. About 500 people demonstrated in front of the Chinese embassy in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, while 300 rallied in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. `` We are going to use every occasion to help people remember June 4 and tell the world we will never forget, nor will we stop fighting for democracy,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lu </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> and Scholars in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>NURRUNGAR, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Anti-nuclear protesters have ended a five-day protest at a U.S.-Australian military intelligence base after 500 demonstrators were arrested, some after breaking into the base. About 50 soldiers were called in to reinforce base security forces and police at the base in southern <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. In the action that ended Sunday, protesters broke into the facility several times, police said. Today, Defense Minister <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazley </PERSON> ordered an investigation into security measures at the base. Demonstrators picked the intelligence-gathering base 360 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Adelaide </LOCATION> as a protest site because they consider it a likely target in the event of a superpower nuclear confrontation. Police said 217 of the 500 protesters were arrested inside the <LOCATION> Nurrungar </LOCATION> base's security zone. The media were prohibited from covering a march from the security gate to the main complex by protesters who broke into the grounds. Six journalists were arrested during protests on Saturday. A <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> newspaper said the protest was `` an embarrassment for <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s defense forces and must give American military authorities cause for concern.'' `` If we are to have <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases and equipment here we should be able to protect them,'' said today's editorial in The Sydney Daily Telegraph.

<HEAD>Researchers Say Underground AIDS Drug Ineffective Against Virus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A report that a popular underground drug is ineffective against the AIDS virus proves that the government should move cautiously before allowing people to take such medicine, some researchers said. In the Oct. 1 issue of the Annals of <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, the researchers reported on the use of dextran sulfate in 18 healthy volunteers. After administering the drug orally and intravenously, the researchers found only traces of the drug's activity using three different methods. `` This is a drug people are going to have to take two steps backward and take another look at,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarchoan </PERSON>, an AIDS researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` Just because it works in a laboratory, you ca n't just go stuffing it in your mouth.'' He said the report should remind researchers and policymakers alike to look at `` the simple things,'' such as whether a drug can be absorbed into the bloodstream, before allowing patients to take it. The study confirms preliminary results announced in February by Dr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, that the drug is poorly absorbed into the bloodstream and shows little promise of fighting the AIDS virus. Researchers in 1987 discovered that dextran sulfate prevented the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, from invading the T-cell lymphocytes, a type of immunity cell that the AIDS virus normally attacks. Following those reports, AIDS patients clamored for the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to allow them to import the drug from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where it was used as an anti-clotting agent. Dextran sulfate's use has not been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. The drug has been imported from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> during the past two years by `` buyers' clubs'' organized by people infected with the virus. Last May, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approved the drug for use in limited clinical trials. Tests of the drug in volunteers, however, have since contradicted the early laboratory findings. Since the publicity generated by the reports of dextran sulfate's success in the laboratory, some researchers felt public pressure made the drug available too early without sufficient testing, according to the principal investigator, Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lietman </PERSON> of The <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lietman </PERSON> said he thought the study's results showed that the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> should continue to move cautiously in allowing AIDS patients access to untested drugs. `` The easier access to unproven drugs is a step backwards,'' he said. Researchers had hoped dextran sulfate might prove effective because it appeared to prevent the AIDS virus from attacking a vital player in the body's immune system, the T-cell. Usually, the virus attacks the T-cells by attaching to a receptor, a type of protein, on the cell's outer layer or envelope. In the test tube studies, researchers found that dextran sulfate prevented the virus from binding to the cell envelope, thus preventing it from invading and killing the cell. Untreated, HIV changes the genetic pattern of the T-cell and forces it to make copies of the virus. But this can not happen if the virus can not invade the cell. But the researchers at Hopkins, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> found little evidence that the drug was absorbed into the bloodstream. `` If dextran sulfate is ultimately found to be an effective anti-HIV agent in humans, its therapeutic index is likely to be small,'' warned the researchers. In addition, the drug is unlikely to prove useful when given intravenously, as the size of the large molecule prohibits it from easily crossing membranes, according to <PERSON> Lietman </PERSON>. Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, who has investigated dextran sulfate since 1986, said the drug had little effect in patients infected with the AIDS virus. `` I do n't think anybody believes anymore that dextran sulfate has any utility,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said.

 Actor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> has been described by federal authorities as an unindicted co-conspirator of former <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> first lady <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, a newspaper reported today. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s name appeared on documents filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in connection with the case against Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, according to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newsday </LOCATION>. `` I ca n't give you any information,'' said <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s agent, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Corman </PERSON>. An indictment last October charged that Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and her husband, the late <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, stole $ 168 million from the Philippine treasury. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON> would not say why <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> was on the list of unindicted co-conspirators, according to <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>. Also named were <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> real estate developers, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, who are brothers, and the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' children, <PERSON> Irene </PERSON>, <PERSON> Imee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the newspaper said. The <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> brothers have told a congressional hearing that they managed the <ORGANIZATION> Marcoses </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate investments. An unindicted co-conspirator may have done something to advance an alleged criminal conspiracy, but did not necessarily know they were doing it. The list of unindicted co-conspirators was included in a pretrial motion filed by one of Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' co-defendants, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The actor, known for his perpetual tan and for his portrayal of a vampire in the movie `` Love at First Bite,'' has denied rumors that he and Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> were romantically linked. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s name previously has come up in connection with legal action against the Marcoses, specifically, in a lawsuit by the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> government against the Marcoses. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bersin </PERSON>, an attorney for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, said the suit alleges that the Marcoses invested in a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> house owned by <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> has said he has done nothing wrong. In March 1986, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said through his attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had no financial involvement in the estate. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> bought the estate, once owned by <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>, for $ 1.2 million in 1981. The deal was financed by <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s own money, <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the seller, <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said. In late 1983, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> used the increased value of the property to get a five-year loan from <ORGANIZATION> Calno </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> N.V. </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antilles </LOCATION>.

 Some of the record 20 tons of cocaine seized last week apparently was stored earlier in warehouses in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and across that city's border with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, drug enforcement officials said. Seven men arrested in the case _ four in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and three in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> _ were expected to be arraigned before federal magistrates today. On Friday, the day after investigators stumbled upon the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> warehouse, officials raided six warehouses in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> and three homes in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>. `` We feel these warehouses were used as staging warehouses before the cocaine was sent to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> special agent <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>. Police said the four suspects held in suburban <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> so far had thwarted investigators' attempts to identify them, giving false names and birthdates and saying only that they were from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Mexican police were said to have the identity of at least one of the men. `` We really do n't know who they are ourselves,'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Leinen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where the cocaine was found. `` They're not too forthcoming.'' Authorities believe the men are Mexican or Colombian, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. Investigators believe one of those arrested in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, may have directed the ring's operations, authorities said. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lochridge </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> worked as a customs inspector for the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION> for 15 years. `` He is the person who rented the warehouse. He paid the bills,'' said <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazell </PERSON>, a deputy <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney. <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, 68, was arrested at the Flamingo Hilton hotel in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, with his son, <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, 34, and his brother, <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON>, 66. Investigators said the cocaine entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> before it was shipped to the warehouse operating as <PERSON> Adriana </PERSON>'s Pottery Warehouse, where the the record seizure was made Thursday. One link between the suburban <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> seizure and a house in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION> was confirmed when one of the suspects arrested in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> telephoned the house from jail. A police officer there answered the phone, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> know the identity of the caller. No arrests were made at the house, but a tractor and two trailers fitted with secret compartments were seized. `` In one of these compartments we found 500 pounds of marijuana,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> also found boxes similar to those found in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> raid, along with Mexican pottery. The cocaine seizure attracted so much attention that crowds showed up at the unguarded <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> warehouse and began removing its remaining contents only hours after the cocaine was removed. About 50 looters snatched up Mexican pottery, paintings, statues, desks, chairs, telephones and other office supplies. No looting arrests were made, and no evidence was taken, police said.

He was 72. <PERSON> Fairbank </PERSON>, professor emeritus of physics at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, suffered a heart attack Saturday while jogging near campus, university officials said Sunday. <PERSON> Fairbank </PERSON> researched the nature of superconductivity and participated in the search for gravity waves, subatomic particles called quarks, and monopoles, believed to be a component of magnetism. His work is the basis of a multi-million dollar project to test a final unproven prediction of <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>'s general theory of relativity. <PERSON> Fairbank </PERSON>, who was working in his lab the night before his death, believed in what he called the `` Anti-Murphy Law of Physics.'' His theory held that when one understands an experimental situation correctly, three or four things come together to make the impossible possible. He performed his first superconductivity experiment in 1947 with his brother, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, also a physicist. <PERSON> Fairbank </PERSON>'s work centered on the ability of some materials to offer no resistance to an electrical current if they are cooled to near absolute zero. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Fairbank </PERSON>'s influence on physics included the development at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> of the superconducting accelerator in which a linear accelerator is cooled to 2 degrees above absolute zero. The superconductivity allows for greater degrees of sensitivity and led to the first demonstration of a free electron laser. <PERSON> Fairbank </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> on Feb. 24, 1917. He graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Whitman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and earned his Ph.D. from <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1948. Before joining <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> in 1959, he taught at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amherst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, as well as working on the staff of the Radiation Laboratory at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fairbank </PERSON> is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>, and sons, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>. His brother is professor emeritus of physics at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.

 A retired pressman's murderous schemes were common knowledge at the plant where he returned last month and shot to death eight people before killing himself, according to a report. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> revealed his plans on several occasions to former co-worker <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, but the warnings were ignored by other co-workers and supervisors and they were never taken up with management, The <ORGANIZATION> Courier-Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>, 47, shot 20 of his former co-workers, killing eight of them before taking his own life Sept. 14. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said the first warning came in late 1987 or early 1988, inside the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gravure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant, where <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> opened a brown paper sack and showed <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> a .38 - caliber snub-nosed <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> recalls that <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> said he was angry at supervisors: `` That if any one of them came up to him and said anything other than what pertained to work-related conversation, that he was going to blow their brains out.'' Another warning came just a few weeks ago, <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said, when <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> confided the names of six people he intended to kill during a conversation at the kitchen table at <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' house. All had been pressroom supervisors or were managers of the plant. Only one, employee relations manager <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Warman </PERSON>, was injured in the attack. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>, who was placed on long-term disability early in the year because of psychiatric problems, also described putting plastic explosives into a remote-controlled airplane, <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said he believed his tormented friend was serious, and began warning others. But for a variety of reasons _ the airplane scheme's improbability, the frequency of bitterness among Standard Gravure workers, and others' affection for <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said his fears were n't shared by others The schemes became common knowledge among pressroom workers and supervisors, but upper management was never informed of it, the <ORGANIZATION> Courier-Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, pressroom superintendent and one of <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' targets, said he did n't take <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' warnings seriously because he doubted <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> was skilled enough to pull off the airplane scheme. He also said he believed <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> was satisfied with the arrangements of his disability leave. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, however, said he knew better. `` I knew something was going to happen, but I did n't know when or what time or where it was coming from,'' he said. `` Every day I hid in different dark spots of the plant. I did n't go in the pressroom or stay around the presses,'' he said. `` I think what he was doing, he was reaching out to me and I did n't grasp it,'' he said. `` God forgive me, I did n't grasp it.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for the first time as a guest of the government, said today that this oil-poor nation must be sensitive to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> concerns and cut its trade with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a news report said. `` It is not necessary for you to think of our interests, think of your own interests,'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> as saying. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would be making a `` fatal mistake'' by ignoring the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, who have the support of 200 million Arabs in a vital region, it quoted <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> as saying in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last year was roughly $ 1.2 billion, a 300 percent increase over 1985, according to Israeli government figures. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, meanwhile, relies on oil from the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> for much of its fuel needs. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, here on a four-day visit, is expected to discuss his views on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process in meetings set for Tuesday with Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Taro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON>. Officials have said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was invited as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, not as president of the self-proclaimed state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. Though <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had visited <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1981, he was then a guest of legislators, not the government. Foreign Ministry officials said the government invitation was intended to show <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s appreciation for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s denunciation of violence in December. One official said the formal invitation also was aimed at bolstering <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s moderate policy amid reported pressures from <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> hard-liners advocating a return to terrorist tactics. Later today, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was to attend a ceremony to rename the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> office the `` Permanent Mission of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. Japanese officials said the government approved the renaming with the understanding that the office's legal status would remain unchanged. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the third country to allow such a renaming, following <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western industrialized countries, holds that <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> has yet to meet generally accepted international law criteria for statehood. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has full diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was created in 1964, bringing together several competing Palestinian groups, including <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fatah </PERSON>. By 1970, it was conducting guerrilla and terrorist operations against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from bases inside neighboring <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>.

 Comedian <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, who apologized last week for racial remarks about mayoral candidate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, previously used a slur against the black Democrat in talking to <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> writers, the magazine says. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> called <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> `` a fancy shvartze with a mustache,'' <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> reported in this week's edition. Shvartze is a Yiddish word for a black person. It is often considered derogatory. The <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> report followed <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s resignation last week from Republican mayoral candidate <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s campaign amid an uproar over remarks <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> made about blacks and published in the weekly newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION>. The remarks were made at a dinner party at which a Voice writer was present. The <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, an ordained rabbi, as saying Jewish support for <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> was based on guilt because Jews were `` sick with complexes.'' The Newsweek remark was made almost a month before the Voice article appeared. <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> said that after <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> made his remark about <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> to the writers at a luncheon, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> joined in the laughter and did n't rebuke <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. Last week, in reacting to <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s comments published in the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said he had never heard <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> speak that way before. On Sunday, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> denied hearing the remark and questioned the Newsweek article. `` As I recall there were four reporters there. I emphasize that the four reporters did not report it, which means they did n't hear it or they did n't attach any significance to it at the time,'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> spokesman, said he heard the remark and mentioned it to <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, who told <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s manager `` he thought it was inappropriate and <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> should be more careful with his language.'' The editor of <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, was quoted in today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> as saying if he had known about the remark at the time, `` We would have published it four weeks ago. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, told that <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said he had not heard the remark, said: `` Put down, ` He smiled.'''

 Federal investigators now believe someone with a grudge against the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION>' former skipper, not revenge-minded terrorists, may have bombed the van his wife drove, according to published reports. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe has shifted its focus to the possibility that the March 10 bombing was carried out by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen, unconnected with the military, who has a personal vendetta against Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The paper quoted a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official who asked to remain anonymous. Federal agents have identified such an individual and are checking his alibis, but no further identification or elaboration was available, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted four unidentified sources Sunday who also said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe is focusing on the personal vendetta theory. Two of those sources said the individual being investigated was a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen. The pipe bomb explosion drew national attention because investigators initially interpreted it as terrorist retribution for the mistaken downing eight months earlier of an Iranian commercial jetliner by the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, an Aegis-class guided missile cruiser commanded by <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>. All 290 people aboard the plane died. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, was alone in the van but got out uninjured moments before it was destroyed by fire at an intersection near the couple's home in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> is based. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> special agent in charge in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, refused to discuss any aspect of the six-month probe. `` We will have the same position we have in any ongoing investigation,'' he said, `` and that is ` no comment.''' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> expressed surprise at the possibility of a personal motive in the attack, saying, `` I have not the remotest idea of anyone who would take a personal vendetta against me or my family.''

 For the first time in his four-year ministry, 90-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Ezra </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> was too feeble to provide the traditional closing address to the faithful, a church official said. `` He has not felt he would speak in this session,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>'s first counselor, said Sunday before the church's 159th Semiannual General Conference ended In recent conferences, <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture secretary, has either delivered or had read for him at least two talks over two days. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>'s sole address this weekend was a Saturday sermon on the elderly read for him by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Monson </PERSON>, his second counselor. During a session on the priesthood Saturday night, <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, seemingly confused, arose and walked to the podium during a sermon by <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>, who cut his remarks short. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> then said `` amen'' and was helped to his seat. Mormon presidents, considered by church members to be prophets, serve for life. On Sunday, members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles recalled Mormonism's pioneer heritage of hardship and devotion as they praised the modern faithful for their self-sacrifice. By giving 10 percent of their income to the church, by serving full-time missions or by remaining at home with young children, <PERSON> Mormons </PERSON> today are exhibiting the same tenacity as church founder <PERSON> Brigham </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and his followers, said Elder <PERSON> Dallin </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oaks </PERSON>. `` In every nation, in every worthy occupation and activity, members of this church face hardships, overcome obstacles and follow the servants of the Lord <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> as valiantly as the pioneers of any age,'' <PERSON> Oaks </PERSON> said. Oaks also touched on what was a prominent theme of the gathering: obedience to the all-male hierarchy of The Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION>. `` In our day, as in the days of earlier pioneers, those in the lead wagons set the direction and signal onward, but it is the faithful men and women in the wagons which follow that provide the momentum and motive power for this great work,'' said Oaks. None of the speakers at the conference in the Tabernacle on Temple Square referred directly to last month's excommunication of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, the first high church official in 46 years to have his membership revoked. The church said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a Navajo Indian who has differed with some church officials in interpreting the Indians' role in the church, was cut off for apostasy, or abandonment of faith, and conduct unbecoming a church member. The leadership in the Mormon church is headed by the three-member First Presidency, followed by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, which supervises the First Quorum of the Seventy, the group to which <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> belonged. Members of the three panels are known as general authorities.

 A 42-foot sailboat missing for almost four months with four men aboard, including an American, washed ashore with all crew members safe, a relative said today. The three-hulled sailboat overturned in heavy seas in early June and the four survived by collecting rainwater and eating fish, seaweed and apples, said <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomes </PERSON>, brother-in-law of the boat's skipper. The missing boat, the <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Noelle </PERSON>, washed ashore on <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> about 60 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION> late Saturday, Tomes said. The boat left <LOCATION> Picton </LOCATION>, on the northern coast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, on June 1 The crew planned a three-week <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> cruise that was to take them as far as <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION>. On board was the boat's owner and skipper, New Zealander <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glennie </PERSON>, an experienced sailor who designed the boat for long-distance cruising; <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hellriegel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nalepka </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, who was in the second of two years as caterer for the Outward Bound program in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nalepka </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, said her family was overjoyed. `` We never gave up hope. He kept hoping he was safe. ... This is wonderful,'' she said. <PERSON> Glennie </PERSON> said today that late on June 3, a strong southerly wind grew to a 60-knot gale. `` About six o'clock in the morning there was a huge wave, and it just flipped the boat upside down,'' <PERSON> Glennie </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Rose-Noelle </ORGANIZATION> floated on its crossbeams, with the cabin top about two feet below water, he said. The craft was stable and would not sink unless it had broken apart, <PERSON> Glennie </PERSON> said. The boat was reported missing on June 24, after it failed to arrive in <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION>. The last radio contact with the crew came on June 9 from near the <LOCATION> Kermadec </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, about 620 miles northeast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. The four survivors, who are all in good health, on Saturday spent their first night on land in 120 days. On Sunday, they broke into an empty cabin, where they found warm clothes. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalmeida </PERSON>, head of the Outward Bound school in <LOCATION> Anakiwa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> that the four planned to go to <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION> to a hospital for tests. `` I received a collect call from someone named <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dalmeida </PERSON> said. `` We were n't going to accept it at first. We do n't have a Jim working here anymore ... but it turned out to be him. None of us could believe it. He said, ` We're alive. Do I still have my job?''' `` They said it is a long, miraculous story,'' said <PERSON> Dalmeida </PERSON>. `` They spent lots of time praying, as you might imagine, and when they hit land they could n't believe they were saved.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Speck </PERSON>, an island resident, was first to meet the tired sailors at the cabin. `` At first I thought these guys were nuts,'' said Speck. `` They were talking about being upside down for four months. I could n't believe it. Their families had given them up for dead, Tomes said. `` We were absolutely ecstatic to hear <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s voice on the phone.

<TEXT>
 Lebanese leaders met for a third day today in an effort to end their country's 14-year-old civil war, but they remained deeply divided over the Syrian army's presence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Saudi officials sought to smooth over the differences as the 63 deputies of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> convened in this Saudi Arabian mountain resort. Conference sources conceded that discord between the 33 <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and 30 Moslem deputies, largely mirroring the sectarian divide in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was hampering progress. Druse Moslem chieftain <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> and Shiite Moslem leader <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main allies in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, oppose a peace plan proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> because they claim proposed political reforms do not go far enough in stripping the Christians of their long-held domination of government, parliament, the judiciary and army. The two warlords, whose support will be essential for any agreement reached in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, flew to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Sunday night for talks with Iranian leaders. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s ally. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> as expressing `` strong opposition'' to the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> plan. Despite the political problems, a cease-fire called by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> Sept. 22 to end six months of fierce artillery battles between the Syrians and Christians seemed to be holding. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today, Syrian troops and their militia allies fired on a <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> military helicopter trying to rescue the pilot of an air force jet fighter that crashed in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> off north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, military sources said. Syrian troops in speedboats later picked up the pilot, identified as Maj. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirhal </PERSON>, and took him to the Syrian-controlled northern port of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, the sources said. The Syrians promised to return him. The <ORGANIZATION> Syrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, controls 70 percent of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> country. It entered <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1976, a year after the civil war broke out, under an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate. Conference sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a sizeable group of parliamentarians, mostly Moslems, want the Syrians to remain in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Others proposed a phased Syrian withdrawal from Moslem sectors of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the Syrians' main stronghold, over two years while the country's constitutional structure, virtually dismantled by the war, is rebuilt. `` Who would take over the responsibility of keeping law and order if the Syrians left with the -LRB- Lebanese -RRB- army divided?'' said <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem. But most of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> deputies, backed by some Moslems allied with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s archrival in the Arab world, demanded an immediate Syrian withdrawal. `` The Syrian military presence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is illegimate ... the Syrians should be made to withdraw from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> within a short period,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, a Maronite who leads the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Christian leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has opposed accepting political reforms aimed at giving Moslems an equal share of power with the long-dominant Christians, until the Syrians pull out. The Taif meeting, the first by <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s parliament outside <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> territory, was convened by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> to negotiate political reforms and formulate a `` national reconciliation charter.''

<TEXT>
 Former Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, one of the few prominent Americans to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since it crushed a pro-democracy movement, urged the country today to keep its doors open to the West. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, in a speech delivered to a business symposium, stressed that relations between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, now at a low ebb, are fundamental for Asian stability. `` The <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people should continue to look outward for their own benefit and for the benefit of both the region and the world,'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said at an economic cooperation symposium hosted by the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, one of the most prominent Americans to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the June military crackdown, has been given a warm welcome here He was invited to sit at the head table with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> during a National Day reception Saturday, and he joined <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top leaders on the <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> rostrum for a 40th anniversary show Sunday evening. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> curtailed high-level official contacts to protest the June violence, in which troops killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of people in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> during suppression of crush pro-democracy demonstrations. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, a private citizen, is now president of the international advisory firm <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. `` Danger, setback and upheaval are the constant companions of economic change,'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said. `` Yet the wisest course, however troubled in the short term, is the one that offers the most progress for the greatest number. `` That is why we all support the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> resolve to continue with the program of economic reform.'' The conservatives now in control in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have pledged that there will be no change in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s policy of economic reform. However, a retrenchment policy that began when inflation and growth got out of hand last fall and accelerated after the June events has raised fears that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is returning to reliance on central control of the economy. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> devoted a large part of his speech to making the point that Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is now carrying out reforms in his country because the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> forced the Soviet military hand. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s ` new thinking' was therefore in my judgment the product of a realistic analysis that the lagging Soviet economy could not bear the additional burden of a dead-ended and isolated foreign policy.'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> warned that even today, the Soviets produce half of all the world's military material and its forces are still largely offensive. `` Let us be careful that in the course of what may be a compulsive, competitive frenzy of disarmament that at the end we are not worse off than we were before,'' he said.

<HEAD>Segregated Church Allows Blacks To Attend Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SELMA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A black student praised the congregation of an all-white church that allowed him to attend worship services after turning him away the week before. `` They are good people,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> said after attending services Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` The church needs to be commended.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a 24-year-old divinity student at <ORGANIZATION> Selma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was joined by three other black men who walked into the sanctuary before the start of services at the 1,300-member church. `` The church has allowed Christ to prevail and the gates of hell to be defeated,'' he said. There were no incidents and the men were greeted warmly on the front steps as they prepared to leave. `` This is a wonderful, great day,'' said the church's pastor, the Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. He said the 18-member board of deacons met Friday night and `` made the decision to seat anyone who comes to worship.'' The full congregation will vote Oct. 11 on whether to back the deacons, he said. The formal policy of not admitting blacks dates from the days of civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s. `` I can not speak for the congregation, -LRB- but -RRB- I think if it's ever rescinded, now is the time it would be,'' the pastor said On Sept. 24, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and two women students at the predominately black Christian college arrived at the church planning to attend the service, but a deacon told them the church had a policy excluding them from worshiping there. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said he was `` shocked and encouraged'' Saturday when a telephone call to <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> revealed a change in the policy. After the service, he called <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> `` a great preacher.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said much of the controversy over his bid to attend services at Central Baptist had been blown out of proportion. He also denied ever saying that a $ 50 bet with one of his professors prompted him to seek entry.

<HEAD>Liability Trial in Northwest Crash Begins</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Jury selection got under way today in the liability trial in the 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> crash that killed 156 people, with lawyers prepared to battle over who is to blame for the tragic outcome of Flight 255. The trial before District Judge <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, expected to take four to six months, will feature about 4,000 exhibits, including shredded plane parts and hundreds of photographs. At issue is whether <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> or the maker of the MD-80 plane, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, or both, are liable in the fiery Aug. 16, 1987, crash. `` Expect a major battle between <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, trying to blame it on each other,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, one of five attorneys serving on a steering committee representing about 100 plaintiffs. `` It's such a hotly contested liability issue. Neither one will admit liability, and that's rare,'' <PERSON> Schaden </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> report on the crash near <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Metropolitan Airport said the pilots failed to properly set the wing flaps and slats before takeoff. The Phoenix-bound plane, never able to gain altitude, slammed into an Interstate 94 entrance ramp, killing 154 people on board and two people on the ground. The sole plane survivor was <PERSON> Cecelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cichan </PERSON>, then 4, who lost her parents and brother and now lives with relatives in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. Some relatives of crash victims said they would be at court every day. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Polec </PERSON>, an organizer of the support group Flight 255: Their Spirit Lives On, said the amount offered in out-of-court settlements so far has been `` an insult.'' `` I want my day in court,'' <PERSON> Polec </PERSON> said. `` My opinion is if you settle with the underwriter, you are patting them on the back and saying everything is OK. I want them punished.'' <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the airline believes <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> is partially to blame in the accident. <PERSON> Schaden </PERSON>, who will be responsible for arguing the case against <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, said he will discuss defects he thinks contributed to the crash, including a disconnected or faulty circuit breaker on the flap - and slats-warning system and an indicator that was supposed to tell pilots if the takeoff warning system was n't working Countered <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>: `` There was no problem with the aircraft. The aircraft is and was perfectly safe.'' Disagreements over liability have made out-of-court settlements with the relatives of victims slow in coming, attorneys for the plaintiffs say. Northwest attorney <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubuc </PERSON> said in August that 46 cases had been resolved out of court and negotiations were continuing in others. He did n't return repeated phone calls last week to his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Dubuc </PERSON> said then that 102 suits were still pending. `` I think going to trial with as many plaintiffs as we have is kind of unusual,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who represents the plaintiffs. Northwest also has filed a suit against <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rental </ORGANIZATION>, saying they are partially responsible in the crash. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> manufactured a circuit breaker used in a warning system that alerts pilots when the flaps and slats are n't set for takeoff <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rental </ORGANIZATION> owned a light pole that <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> claims was higher than the legal limit, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. The plane struck the light pole as it struggled to lift off at the end of the runway. That suit is expected to be heard after the liability trial.

 Five bombs presumably set off by drug traffickers exploded in three Colombian cities and injured at least four people, police said today. On Sunday, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> said it had deported a top drug suspect to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> newspapers said the army seized guns and cash at the home of another reputed cocaine kingpin. National police in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> said three people were wounded when three bombs exploded Sunday in the western city of <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, home of a powerful cocaine cartel. Another person was injured when a bomb exploded in the northern city of <LOCATION> Sincelejo </LOCATION>. An explosion in the capital caused no injuries. A 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew was ordered in <LOCATION> Sincelejo </LOCATION>, where four other bombs were found and deactivated, the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> radio chain <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, Interior Minister <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallejo </PERSON> was quoted as saying that `` Drug traffickers should know that they ca n't hide in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>.'' An official statement released late Sunday said suspected drug dealer <PERSON> Evaristo </PERSON> <PERSON> Porras </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardila </PERSON> was sent back to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> earlier in the day but gave no details. <PERSON> Porras </PERSON> was ranked No. 8 on a list of traffickers who were most-wanted in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s 6-week-old war on the nation's cocaine cartels. He is not, however, among the 12 Colombians the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants extradited to face drug charges. None of the 12 has been captured. <PERSON> Porras </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s capital, on Wednesday, according to the government statement. Since 1987, he had lived in that country under an assumed name and was president of Ecuamer, an import-export enterprise, the statement said. <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION> earlier said <PERSON> Porras </PERSON> was to be sent to the border, where he would be met by Colombian police. The <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> reported that four detectives were sent to bring <PERSON> Porras </PERSON> back to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION>, another <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily, quoted an unidentified police official as saying 500 officers and soldiers tried to capture another major trafficking suspect in a raid Saturday 50 miles north of the capital. But as the army and police closed in, two helicopters flew away from the suspected hideout of <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, 42, a leading figure in the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel, is on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s list of the 12 most-wanted drug figures. He faces drug-trafficking, conspiracy and racketeering charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The cartel is headquartered in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s second-largest city of the same name. The <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION> drug cartels are thought responsible for 80 percent of cocaine entering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets. Saturday's raid was near the town of <LOCATION> Pacho </LOCATION>, where troops last month seized 18 ranches belonging to <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Espectador </PERSON> said. Police seized $ 196,000 in burlap bags and 40 guns, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Espectador </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> began the crackdown on drug lords Aug. 19, one day after the assassination of the leading presidential candidate, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, who led a crusade against drug traffickers in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. Cocaine barons responded by declaring war on the government, initiating bombings, slayings and other attacks. In the past month, Colombians have been terrorized by 127 explosions that have killed 10 people and injured 148. The drug bosses hope to intimidate the government into abandoning its pledge to extradite narcotics traffickers, who enjoy relative impunity under the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> justice system, through payoffs or intimidation. So far, one suspect has been extradited and proceedings are under way against a second.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and <PERSON> Anglican </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> pledged today to search for unity but noted that the Anglican ordination of women remains an obstacle to healing the churches' 400-year-old schism. `` We solemnly recommit ourselves and those we represent to the restoration of visible unity and full ecclesial communion,'' said a declaration they signed at the end of <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>'s first official visit to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, who as archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> is spiritual head of the state Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and leader of the world's 70 million Anglicans, said the commitment to continue talks on unification with the 850 million Roman Catholics should not be dismissed as `` a pure academic exercise.'' <PERSON> Runci </PERSON> told a news conference that his four-day trip allowed him to build trust with <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials and discuss ways to revive and spread religious practice. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials also promised to respond soon to a 7-year-old report by an Anglican-Catholic commission outlining possible theological agreements between the churches, he said. Anglican bishops have accepted the report. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and Anglican officials have been holding talks since 1966 on unifying their churches, which split four centuries ago over the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s refusal to annul King <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON>'s marriage to <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> of <PERSON> Aragon </PERSON>. The new declaration noted problems raised in recent years by the ordination of women in some of the Anglican Communion's 27 self-governing provinces, including the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` The question and practice of the admission of women to the ministerial priesthood in some provinces of the Anglican Communion prevents rerconciliation between us even where there is otherwise progress toward agreement in faith on the meaning of the Eucharist and the ordained ministry,'' the declaration said. However, Cardinal <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Willebrands </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promoting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>, told the news conference: `` This meeting has absolutely not been dominated by the theme of the ordination of women.'' He called the ordination issue an obstacle `` to be considered and overcome.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to revive an allegedly abused foster child's federal lawsuit against the social workers and government agency that placed him in his foster home. The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court ruling in a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> case that no such right to sue exists. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Milburn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, now 20, was not quite 2 years old when in 1971 the <ORGANIZATION> Anne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arundel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> placed him with foster parents <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> of <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnie </PERSON>. His parents voluntarily had placed him in the custody of the social services agency. <PERSON> Milburn </PERSON>'s federal lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Tuckers </ORGANIZATION>, individual social workers and the county agency said he was subjected to physical abuse for nearly two years before being removed from the <ORGANIZATION> Tuckers </ORGANIZATION>' home The suit, which sought $ 66 million in damages, said his injuries included two leg fractures, a facial laceration and severe burns that left his hands permanently scarred and disabled. The suit alleged that Mrs. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, with her husband's knowledge, inflicted all the injuries _ including her immersing the youngster's hands in boiling water. <PERSON> Milburn </PERSON>'s suit, based on alleged violations of his constitutional due-process rights, was thrown out by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, and the 4th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the dismissal last March 31. Such lawsuits must establish that the alleged harm was caused by the government or some government agent. The 4th Circuit ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> Tuckers </ORGANIZATION> did not fit the definition of government agents. `` The state of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> was not responsible for ... the -LRB- alleged -RRB- physical child abuse itself,'' the appeals court said. `` It exercised no coercive power over the <ORGANIZATION> Tuckers </ORGANIZATION>; neither did it encourage them.'' The appeals court noted that a parallel lawsuit filed in state court, alleging <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> tort law violations, is awaiting action. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last February ruled that public officials may not be sued in federal court when their alleged gross negligence permits a child to be abused by a parent. That decision in a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> case said a state does not have a constitutional duty to protect people, including abused children, who are not in the state's custody. Writing for the court then, Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said, `` As a general matter, we conclude that a state's failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the -LRB- Constitution's -RRB- due process clause.'' That constitutional provision bars deprivation of life, liberty and property without due process of law. A footnote in the February decision, however, said the justices were leaving undecided whether due-process considerations would arise in the case of children abused by foster parents. The case is <PERSON> Milburn </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Anne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arundel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, 89-96.

 Clashes between two political factions vying to lead <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> into independence left two people dead and at least 30 injured, officials and news reports said today. A 27-year-old man was clubbed to death when he and four friends stopped at a small shop in the northern town of <LOCATION> Oshakati </LOCATION> on Saturday, said <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roux </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s adminstrator, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roux </PERSON> said the victim and his friends were supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> and were attacked by about 80 backers of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the party favored in the country's elections next month. Also, a <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> supporter was beaten to death in <LOCATION> Oshakati </LOCATION> and the homes and shops of party members were attacked in northern towns during the weekend, The Star of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Roux </PERSON> said at least 30 people were hurt Sunday, one critically, when people disrupted rallies held by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnhalle </ORGANIZATION> alliance around <LOCATION> Oshakati </LOCATION>. The clashes included gunfire, grenades, fires and looting, according to the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is controlled by the South African government. The elections are for the national assembly that will be empowered to draw up a constitution for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, which has been ruled by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for 74 years. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which agreed to relinquish control of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> under a regional peace accord, has not announced a date for independence but it is expected to be early next year. The predominantly black SWAPO, which waged a 23-year bush war against <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African rule, is a leftist-leaning party that draws its strongest support from the Ovambo people of northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The alliance, a moderate, multiracial coalitiion, is expected to be the second-leading vote getter out of the 10 parties contesting the race. There have been sporadic cases of violence since the election campaign began formally in July, and it has increased as the election nears.

<HEAD>Court to Decide If Witnesses May Make Public Testimony in Florida

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether states may prohibit grand jury witnesses from making public their own testimony once the investigation has ended. The justices said they will review an attempt by <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> officials to block a former newspaper reporter from disclosing details of his appearance before a grand jury three years ago. A federal appeals court said a state law barring such public disclosure violates free-speech rights. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a former reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald-News </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, wants to publish a news story and possibly a book about a 1986 grand jury investigation into allegations of corruption in the county sheriff's department and the county's state attorney office. The grand jury probe ended in 1986, and no indictments were handed down. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s lawyer, in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was subjected to `` abusive'' questioning by a state attorney when appearing before the grand jury. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> no longer is a reporter and no longer lives in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, said his lawyer, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. Concerned that he could be charged with a crime for disclosing his grand jury information, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> sued in an effort to have the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law overturned. A federal trial judge upheld the law and threw out <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s suit. But the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled for <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. The appeals court said the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law violates free-speech rights `` as it applies to witnesses who speak about the nature of their own grand jury testimony after the investigation has been completed.'' Such a `` permanent and absolute obligation of secrecy'' is not justified, the appeals court said. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> then sought <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review, arguing that the 11th Circuit court's ruling sacrifices the grand jury secrecy that shields the reputations of innocent people. `` A tradition steeped in American jurisprudence has been cast aside despite the fact that the termination of one investigation does not necessarily mean that the testimony gathered during that investigation may not generate further investigations,'' <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> told the justices. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> urged the court to reject the state's appeal, noting that most states and the federal government impose no such permanent restraints on grand jury witnesses. `` <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s rule of blanket secrecy ... can not be constitutionally justified,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> contended. The case is <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 88-1993.

<HEAD>Maryland Club That Won't Admit Women Fails To Regain Tax Break</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A golf club that has counted presidents and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> among its members failed today in a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> bid to regain a tax break revoked because of the club's refusal to admit women as members The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> officials did not violate the rights of <ORGANIZATION> Burning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> members by scraping a tax break worth more than $ 300,000 a year. Burning Tree has 440 members and is located just outside the nation's capital in the affluent suburb of <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, The club had a long-term agreement with the state to preserve its open spaces in return for favorable property-tax treatment. But in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> canceled the agreement. The club, an all-male bastion since its founding in 1922, was told it must either admit women or have its land taxed at full value. <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> officials also said the club's refusal to admit women violated the state's <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amendment </ORGANIZATION> enacted in 1972. The <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in March that a law forcing the club to choose between admitting women or losing its tax break did not violate the members' freedom-of-association rights. The law `` does not even prohibit Burning Tree from discriminating,'' the state's highest court said. `` It simply provides that if Burning Tree continues to discriminate, its property will be assessed in the same manner as the property of other taxpayers in the area.'' Burning Tree officials argued their club should be exempt from recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings empowering government officials to end sex discrimination at such large, national organizations as the <ORGANIZATION> Jaycees </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clubs </ORGANIZATION>. Burning Tree's appeal said the club is a more intimate group and has a limited purpose: providing a `` congenial'' setting for men devoted to the game of golf. The <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> appeals court, however, ruled that the state is only withdrawing a benefit, not forcing the club to accept women. `` The state is simply declining to subsidize any organization that engages in discriminatory activities,'' the state court said. `` Just because Burning Tree's members may have associational rights does not oblige the state to subsidize the exercise of those rights.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in 1988 gave states and local communities power to ban sex and race bias at private clubs smaller than the <ORGANIZATION> Jaycees </ORGANIZATION> and Rotary. The court upheld a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> law banning discrimination by private clubs with more than 400 members. Two justices who joined that unanimous opinion, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, once belonged to male-only clubs. The case is Burning Tree vs. <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, 88-1970.

<HEAD>High Court Agrees to Review Army School Case From Georgia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> must bargain with unions over the wages and fringe benefits received by teachers at Army-run schools. The court said it will review a ruling that the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> had a legal duty to bargain with teachers at two <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stewart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, schools attended by children of military personnel. The teachers union, an affiliate of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, sought a 13.5 percent wage increase in 1987 and various fringe benefit improvements for teachers at the two elementary schools. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to negotiate with the union over the demands, and that order was upheld in November 1988 by the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The appeals court rejected arguments that the proposed wage hike and benefit improvements would interfere with the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s right to set its own budget. `` Although the proposals obligate the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to spend funds for salaries in the succeeding fiscal year, the government will appropriate funds before the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> incurs these obligations,'' the appeals court said. The appeals court also rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s claim that it should be permitted to set teacher salaries according to how much teachers are paid in local public schools. There is no compelling need for such comparability, the 11th Circuit court said. In the appeal acted on today, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration lawyers said other groups of federal workers _ whose salaries are not fixed by law _ could be affected if the appeals court's approach is adopted nationwide. The appeal said other federal appeals courts have ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is under no such obligation. In urging the justices to reject the government's appeal, lawyers for the teachers union said only a tiny fraction of federal workers _ less than one percent _ might be affected if the appeals court's approach prevailed nationwide. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stewart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, 89-65.

 Afghan rebels said today they will send a delegation to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to lobby for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s seat at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which is now occupied by the Soviet-backed government. <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafrie </PERSON>, information minister in the guerrillas' self-proclaimed government-in-exile, said the group also would meet with <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials to discuss fighting the flow of heroin from war-torn <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> The four-man delegation, led by the rebels' interior minister, <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalis </PERSON>, will be present for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> debate on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in late October or early November, the information minister said.

<TEXT>
 Eight Mafia figures from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> convicted in the 1979 murders of crime chieftain <PERSON> Carmine </PERSON> <PERSON> Galante </PERSON> and two of his associates lost <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeals today. The court, without comment, let stand the federal racketeering convictions of family bosses <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Corallo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carmine </PERSON> <PERSON> Persico </PERSON>, high-ranking mobsters <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Santoro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Furnari </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gennaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Langella </PERSON>, and mob members <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Scopo </PERSON>. The racketeering convictions stemmed, in part, from the plotting of <PERSON> Galante </PERSON>'s July 12, 1979 murder at a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> restaurant. Also gunned down were <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON> and <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Turano </PERSON>. Federal prosecutors say there are five distinct Mafia groups in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ the Genovese, <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lucchese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> `` families.'' Prosecutors say <PERSON> Corallo </PERSON> was boss of the Lucchese family, which <PERSON> Santoro </PERSON> served as `` underboss'' and <PERSON> Furnari </PERSON> as `` consigliere.'' <PERSON> Persico </PERSON> led the <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> family and <PERSON> Langella </PERSON> served as his underboss. <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> was boss of the Genovese family; <PERSON> Persico </PERSON> boss of the <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> family and <PERSON> Langella </PERSON> its underboss. <PERSON> Scopo </PERSON>, a member of the <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> family, was also president of the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concrete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Laborers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> family `` soldier'' promoted after the <PERSON> Galante </PERSON> killings, was the only defendant accused of participating in them. Evidence at the eight men's 11-week jury trial indicated that the activities of Mafia families throughout the nation are coordinated by a `` commission'' which each family boss serves as a member. Through the 1970s, the <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> family was not represented directly on the commission because of internal disputes. <PERSON> Galante </PERSON> was the <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> family boss, and prosecutors said the commission ordered his murder as a means of resolving the disputes. Each of the defendants was convicted of conspiracy in violation of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -LRB- RICO -RRB-. All the defendants except <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> received 100-year prison sentences. He was sentenced to 40 years but that term was reduced to 20 years on appeal. Except for overturning part of <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON>'s conviction, the 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the RICO conspiracy convictions last Jan. 31. In the appeals acted on today, lawyers for the Mafia figures argued, among other things, that prosecutors failed to prove a sufficient connection between the <PERSON> Galante </PERSON> murder and the commission. The cases are <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-1881; <LOCATION> Salerno </LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-2060; <PERSON> Persico </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-2061; Scopo vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-2071.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Postal Service Soliciting Issue in Maryland Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether the government may prohibit soliciting on all Postal Service property, including sidewalks adjacent to post office buildings. The justices said they will review a case from <LOCATION> Bowie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, in which a federal appeals court struck down the ban as unconstitutional. Other federal appeals courts have upheld the ban. <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Kokinda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON> were arrested outside the <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> post office on Aug. 6, 1986, after they refused to stop soliciting contributions and distributing literature from a sidewalk table. The two are volunteers for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the political arm of an organization headed by political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>. They had set up the table on a sidewalk adjacent to the post office building. The post office in <LOCATION> Bowie </LOCATION>, like many in suburban and rural communities, is a freestanding building with its own sidewalk and parking lot. A municipal sidewalk runs in front of the post office property, separating the parking lot from the street. Ms. <PERSON> Kokinda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON> were convicted in a trial before a federal magistrate of violating a regulation banning `` soliciting, electioneering, collecting debts, vending and advertising'' on <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> property. There was no evidence that the two had blocked or interfered with people entering and leaving the post office. But postal officials said they received more than 40 complaints from patrons during the several hours Ms. <PERSON> Kokinda </PERSON> and Pearl were there. Ms. <PERSON> Kokinda </PERSON> was fined $ 50 and sentenced to 10 days in jail. Pearl was fined $ 100 and given a suspended 30-day jail term. A federal judge upheld the convictions, but the 4th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> threw them out by a 2-1 vote last Jan. 31. The appeals court rejected the government's argument that there is a difference between city sidewalks and a sidewalk located entirely on <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> property. The appeals court called the activities by Ms. <PERSON> Kokinda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON> `` classic political speech pursued peacefully in a place that traditionally has been held open to the public for expressive activities.'' Because the sidewalk outside the post office is a `` public forum,'' the appeals court said, soliciting and other forms of speech could not be banned `` except by content-neutral time, place and manner regulations that furthered a significant government interest.'' The 4th Circuit court's ruling set a binding legal precedent for <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. In the appeal acted on today, government lawyers noted that two other appeals courts have upheld the soliciting ban after ruling that a sidewalk like the one at issue in <LOCATION> Bowie </LOCATION> is not a public forum. `` The Postal Service will not be able to enforce a single nationwide standard to deal with the problem of solicitation and other forms of speech on the grounds of the 35,000 post office facilities around the country,'' the appeal said. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Kokinda </PERSON>, 88-2031.

<HEAD>Court to Review California Man's Federal Disability Pay</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to consider making it easier for the government to cut off disability pay to some former federal workers. The court said it will review a ruling that barred termination of a disability annuity for a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> man who was given incorrect information about benefits eligibility. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> welder from <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, asked a federal official in 1986 how much money he was allowed to make as a bus driver without sacrificing his disability annuity. He was told that if his pay for two years exceeded 80 percent of what his welder's job had paid, he would lose the disability benefit. <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON> also was given an out-of-date federal manual with the same information. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had amended the law in 1982 to cut off annuity payments to anyone making more than 80 percent of the former government job's one-year salary. <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> in 1986 did some overtime work as a bus driver and earned $ 19,936. Eighty percent of his pay as a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> welder that year would have been $ 19,016. When the government cut off his disability annuity because he exceeded the ceiling, <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON> challenged the decision. He said he had relied on the misinformation he received from the government. A federal appeals court here ordered the annuity restored. The appeals court said in a ruling last December that the government recklessly misled <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers, in appealing to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, said the government should not be prevented `` from executing the laws as written by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because of the errors of government agents.'' The appeal also said <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> suffered little harm. It accused him of trying `` to work the system as close to the edge as possible,'' seeking to keep the annuity while making as much in bus driver wages as he could. The case is Office of Personnel Management vs. <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, 88-1943.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether hospitals and nursing care homes may sue in federal court to challenge how a state-run Medicaid program reimburses their costs. The court said it will review a ruling that would allow a hospital association to invoke a federal civil rights law in suing <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> over the state's Medicaid reimbursement rates. The attorneys general of 36 states told the court its ruling, expected sometime next year, will affect hundreds of millions of dollars in federal and state funding. The <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> sued the state in 1986, attacking the state's Medicaid reimbursement rates. The lawsuit alleges that the too-low rates violate the federal Medicaid Act and the due-process rights of participating hospitals. Medicaid is paid primarily by the federal government but individual state agencies administer the program aimed at providing health care to the poor. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> officials sought to have the suit dismissed, contending that only health care recipients _ not individual or associated health care providers _ have the right to sue under the Medicaid Act. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> rejected that contention last Feb. 22 in a decision that set a binding legal precedent for <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Acknowledging that the Medicaid Act does not expressly give hospitals and nursing care home the right to sue a state, the appeals court ruled that the right is implied. Such suits may be filed under a much-used, Reconstruction era civil rights law, the 4th Circuit court said. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> argued that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not intend to enable hospitals and nursing care homes to sue over Medicaid rate disputes. They also contended that the state should be shielded from such suits by immunity granted under the Constitution's 11th Amendment. A `` friend-of-the-court'' brief written by the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> attorney general's staff and submitted in behalf of 36 states urged the justices to reverse the 4th Circuit court's ruling. The ruling leaves Medicaid providers `` free to attack ... the reasonableness of each state's reimbursement rates,'' the states' brief said `` Every routine rate challenge may be made a federal case.'' The case is <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, 88-2043.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether federal agencies sometimes must negotiate with employee unions over what goods and services the government buys from private businesses. The justices said they will resolve conflicting court rulings in the `` contracting-out'' dispute. The appeal granted review today was filed by lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which contends that an agency's power to contract for the goods and services it needs from private industry is an exclusive management prerogative not subject to negotiation. But the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, which adjudicates collective bargaining disputes between federal agencies and their employees, ruled against the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. The authority said grievance and arbitration provisions of the tax agency's labor contract with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> apply to disputed contracting-out cases. The authority ordered the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> to bargain with the <ORGANIZATION> NTEU </ORGANIZATION> over the union's proposals. A <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> panel here, by a 2-1 vote, upheld the <ORGANIZATION> FLRA </ORGANIZATION> ruling last Feb. 28. Other federal appeals courts, however, have ruled that federal agencies have no such obligation. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> argued that the FLRA ruling will harm government efficiency. `` Under the scenario contemplated by the <ORGANIZATION> FLRA </ORGANIZATION>, long after an agency has decided to contract work out and has accordingly entered into ... a contract with a private entity, the agency may be told by an arbitrator that the contracting-out decision must be reconsidered under the conditions that existed when it was made,'' the appeal said. `` That prospect is not conducive to efficient agency management,'' it added. <ORGANIZATION> FLRA </ORGANIZATION> lawyers told the justices that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> case was decided correctly by the appeals court, but the authority did not oppose the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> appeal. The case is <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> vs. FLRA, 88-2123.

<HEAD>Supreme Court to Consider Reinstatement of Minnesota Man's Murder
Conviction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to consider reinstating the murder conviction of a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> man who says he was duped into driving the getaway car in a gas station holdup. The court said it will review a ruling that police violated the man's rights when they arrested him without a warrant at the house a where he was staying. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> was convicted of murder, armed robbery and assault in the July 18, 1987, holdup of a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> gas station. The station's manager was shot to death. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> was sentenced to life in prison plus six years. The <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s conviction last February and granted him a new trial, ruling that he had been the victim of an unlawful arrest. Police, acting on an informant's tip, did not obtain a court warrant or permission to enter the house where <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> was staying before they went in and arrested him. The fact that <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> was a guest at the home did not deprive him of privacy rights, the state court said. Noting that police said they failed to get a warrant because it was a Sunday, the state court said that is `` surely a curious reason for not observing the constitutional safeguards of citizens.'' The state court also rejected arguments that police were faced with an emergency. Ordering a retrial, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said prosecutors may not use a statement <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> made shortly after the arrest in which he admitted driving the getaway car. Prosecutors said discrepancies in the statement undermine <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s claim that he was an innocent dupe of the man who held up the gas station and shot the manager. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s appeal to the nation's highest court was supported by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorneys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and officials from 10 states: <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. The justices were urged to clarify whether house guests have the same right against unreasonable police searches and seizures as people in their own homes. The case is <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, 88-1916.

<HEAD>Court Will Hear West Virginia Decision on Black Lung Victims's Legal
Fees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether a federal law unfairly makes it too difficult for coal miners who contract `` black lung'' disease to obtain a lawyer's help when seeking benefits The justices said they will review a <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruling that the system for awarding lawyer fees in black lung benefits cases violates due-process rights. Pneumoconiosis, a chronic respiratory and pulmonary disease commonly called black lung, afflicts numerous coal miners. Under the Black Lung Benefits Act, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> provides benefits to those miners who become totally disabled because of the disease. Those who apply for such benefits are entitled to have a lawyer's help, and lawyers who assist miners in obtaining benefits have their fees paid by the coal mine operator, its insurance carrier or the government. To get such fees paid, a lawyer must apply separately to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and to the official that presided over the application hearing. No fees award is made until a miner receives a final award of benefits. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Triplett </PERSON>, beginning in 1978, entered into contingent-fee agreements to help about 15 miners seeking black lung benefits. The agreements entitled <PERSON> Triplett </PERSON> to one-fourth of any back benefits collected by the miners. Since the fees <PERSON> Triplett </PERSON> collected between 1978 and 1983 were never approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> or any court, they were in violation of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> regulations. The <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION>'s Committee on Legal Ethics in 1987 recommended that the state's highest court enforce a recommended six-month suspension against <PERSON> Triplett </PERSON> for violating the regulations. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, in a 3-2 decision last year, refused to enforce the suspension. The state court said the evidence made clear that most lawyers are unwilling to represent miners seeking black lung benefits because of `` inadequate fees'' and the long delays in collecting them. Once a miner is awarded benefits, the state court said, it often takes `` an additional two years ... for a lawyer to be paid his fee.'' There is no provision for interest. The result, the state court said, is to deny those applying for black lung benefits `` property without due process of law by severely restricting their right to obtain competent counsel in the highly adversarial process of black lung litigation.'' The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> court's ruling did not bar the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s own enforcement of its attorney-fee regulations, but it knocked out the primary method of enforcing those regulations in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgina </LOCATION> _ state bar disciplinary proceedings. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said, `` The decision below substantially deprives black lung claimants in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> of the protection against overreaching and against unjustified dimunition of their benefits that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> mandated in regulating attorney's fees.'' The appeal noted that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> is one of the nation's principal coal-mining states, and added, `` If not reversed, the -LRB- state court's -RRB- decision may also encourage attorneys in other coal-mining states to flout the black lung fee requirements. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Triplett </PERSON>, 88-1671.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Agrees to Hear Case from Illinois About Political Patronage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today set the stage for an important ruling on political patronage, agreeing to decide whether public employers may be forced to put aside partisanship when hiring, promoting and transferring workers. The court said it will hear an appeal by two men and a woman who said their job status suffered because they did n't support the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. The court also agreed to hear a related appeal by <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> officials seeking to preserve patronage powers in determining when government workers may be laid off and rehired. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> asked the court to reinstate their lawsuit against Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and state and local <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officials. They said their rights of free speech and association, protected by the Constitution's First Amendment, were violated. Ms. <PERSON> Rutan </PERSON> said she repeatedly was denied promotions to supervisory positions in the state <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> because she did not support Republicans candidates. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, an equipment operator, allegedly was denied an <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> transfer to another county because party officials opposed it. And <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the state <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has refused to hire him since 1978 because he could not get the backing of key Republican leaders. `` Those who are politically favored are promoted, transferred or hired,'' they said. `` Those who are not so favored are not promoted, transferred or hired.'' They sued for more than $ 1 billion in damages, and sought to have control of the state employment system shifted to a court-appointed federal receiver. A federal judge threw out their suit, and the 7th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, by a 7-2 vote in February, upheld the dismissal. The appeals court, relying on a series of <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions, said public employees enjoy broad First Amendment protection from being fired or threatened with firing. But the high court has not extended the same constitutional safeguards to hiring, promotion and transfer, the appeals court said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a 1980 ruling that significantly weakened the patronage system, said government workers may not be fired solely because of their political affiliation unless that was an appropriate requirement for carrying out their jobs. The 7th Circuit court said, `` Employment decisions not involving dismissals ... are significantly less coercive and disruptive than discharges ... A person denied a promotion or transfer ... still retains his job and his ability to meet his financial obligations.'' The appeals court said a judge should be reluctant to intrude into the political process and become `` a platonic guardian over state employment systems.'' Changes in the patronage system are better left to legislatures, the appeals court added. But the appeals court ruled in favor of two workers laid off from state jobs, saying layoffs are similar in key respects to firings. It ordered additional hearings in those cases. The cases are <PERSON> Rutan </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1872, and <PERSON> Frech </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Rutan </PERSON>, 88-2074.

<HEAD>Court to Consider Bail Issue in New Mexico Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to consider increasing the federal government's power to keep some accused criminals behind bars while they await trial. The court said it will review a ruling in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> case that forces the government to free, on bail, some defendants deemed to be dangerous or a risk to flee before trial. A federal appeals court said pretrial release is required _ even for a defendant who otherwise could be held in custody _ if a pretrial detention hearing is not held the first time that person appears before a judge or magistrate. The justices in 1987 upheld a federal law allowing denial of bail before trial to people deemed dangerous to the community, even if accused of non-violent crimes. Before the 1984 law, called the Bail Reform Act, pretrial bail generally would be denied only if a judge determined the defendant was likely to flee. In practice, however, federal judges could get around the old law by setting very high bail, ostensibly aimed at guaranteeing the defendant's appearance in court but effectively keeping the accused in custody while awaiting trial. A provision in the 1984 law states that a hearing to determine whether pretrial detention is justified must be held `` immediately upon the person's first appearance before the judicial officer, unless that person or the attorney for the government seeks a continuance.'' A federal trial judge and the 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the `` first appearance'' provision of the law had been ignored in the case of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Montalvo-Murillo </LOCATION>, charged with possessing nearly $ 1 million worth of cocaine. Montalvo-Murillo, a citizen of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> then legally living in this country, was stopped last February while driving a pickup truck near the Mexican border at <LOCATION> Orogrande </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> N.M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents found 72 pounds of cocaine, with a wholesale value of almost $ 1 million, in the truck. At a Feb. 16 proceeding, a federal magistrate put off a detention hearing until Feb. 21. After that hearing, the magistrate decided to release Montalvo-Murillo on $ 50,000 bail and other conditions. Government prosecutors appealed to a federal judge, who ruled that <PERSON> Montalvo-Murillo </PERSON> posed both a danger to the community and a risk to flee. But the judge ruled that the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> magistrate, in postponing the detention hearing for five days, violated the federal bail law's `` first appearance'' rule. The judge said the only appropriate remedy was the defendant's release on bail. Montalvo-Murillo was freed on $ 88,500 bail, and has been a fugitive from justice ever since. He is believed to have fled to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The 10th Circuit court upheld the judge's ruling that the only remedy for denying a defendant a timely detention hearing is release on bail _ even if the result of the hearing would have been holding the defendant without bail. In the appeal acted on today, government lawyers argued that automatic release for such procedural infractions is not required by the 1984 law. `` The court of appeals erred in imposing a remedy so plainly at odds with the objectives of the Bail Reform Act,'' the appeal said. Lawyers for <PERSON> Montalvo-Murillo </PERSON> urged the court to reject the government's appeal, contending among other things that their client's status as a fugitive makes his case moot. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. Montalvo-Murillo, 89-163.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected an appeal by an anti-pornography activist who says sexually explicit photographs and caricatures in Hustler magazine libeled her and invaded her privacy. The court, without comment, refused to revive a $ 150 million lawsuit by feminist author <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Dworkin </PERSON>. A federal judge threw out the suit, and the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the dimissal last January. The Hustler references to <PERSON> Dworkin </PERSON> were opinion, not statements of fact, and therefore are protected by the free-speech guarantees in the Constitution's First Amendment, the appeals court said. `` <PERSON> Dworkin </PERSON> errs by limiting opinion to high-minded discourse,'' the appeals court said. Shielding all opinion from lawsuits `` means that outrageous and outlandish statements are sometimes protected,'' the appeals court said. But it added, `` Ludicrous statements are much less insidious and debilitating than falsities that bear the ring of truth. We have little doubt that the outrageous and outlandish will be recognized for what they are.'' The appeals court also noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1988 threw out a $ 200,000 award against <ORGANIZATION> Hustler </ORGANIZATION> won by television evangelist <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, who accused the magazine of causing him emotional distress by publishing a pornographic parody. In that decision, the justices gave broad free-speech protection to parodies and satire. <PERSON> Dworkin </PERSON> said she was viciously lampooned by Hustler and its publisher, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>, because of her opposition to pornography. She is the author of an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> ordinance, since declared unconstitutional, that defined pornography as a violation of women's civil rights and permitted lawsuits against pornographers. <PERSON> Dworkin </PERSON> sued over features published in three 1984 issues of Hustler. One was a cartoon of two women engaged in lesbian sex in which one woman says to the other, `` You remind me so much of <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Dworkin </PERSON>.'' A second feature included a series of photographs that referred to `` the <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Dworkin </PERSON> fan club.'' A photograph in a third issue identified a woman engaged in sex as <PERSON> Dworkin </PERSON>'s mother. <PERSON> Dworkin </PERSON> sued in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> but the case was transferred to a federal court in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> at the request of Hustler. The case is <PERSON> Dworkin </PERSON> vs. Hustler, 88-1900.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Libel Award Against Rhode Island Newspaper</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let stand a $ 278,600 libel award against a <LOCATION> Pawtucket </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, newspaper. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that news stories may be libelous even if they contain no false statement. Today's action sets no national legal precedent, but instead leaves unresolved conflicting lower court rulings on the issue. The <ORGANIZATION> Pawtucket </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, published by a subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> Ingersoll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> group, was ordered to pay $ 28,600 in compensatory damages and $ 250,000 in punitive damages to Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Healey </PERSON>, a prominent <LOCATION> Pawtucket </LOCATION> surgeon who chaired the local <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors The <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the jury award last March 3, ruling that an Evening Times article falsely implied that <PERSON> Healey </PERSON> was asked, and refused, to interrupt a <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> board meeting to help a heart attack victim. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lampinski </PERSON> had gone to the board's June 23, 1980 meeting to criticize the firings of two <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> staff members but was ordered by <PERSON> Healey </PERSON> to leave. <PERSON> Lampinski </PERSON> then joined a group of protesters about 200 yards from the room where the board meeting was being held. He collapsed minutes later. <PERSON> Lampinski </PERSON> was given first aid almost immediately, and an ambulance arrived within 10 minutes. The heart attack, however, was fatal. An Evening Times article two days later reported that <PERSON> Lampinski </PERSON>'s sons were angry over the <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> board's treatment of their father. The article said the family felt <PERSON> Lampinski </PERSON> `` should have been given early attention by either a doctor or a paramedic at the board meeting.'' The next paragraph said, `` Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Healey </PERSON> is Y president and was at the meeting when <PERSON> Lampinski </PERSON> collapsed.'' The following paragraph noted that <PERSON> Lampinski </PERSON> collapsed 200 yards from where the board was meeting, and the article went on to quote a <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> official refuting any implication that <PERSON> Healey </PERSON> or any other board member was lax in responding to an emergency. The official was quoted as saying that board members, when told of <PERSON> Lampinski </PERSON>'s collapse, also were told that `` the situation was well in hand and already being taken care of.'' In its ruling, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s highest court said the June 25 article that included the <PERSON> Lampinski </PERSON> family criticism could have `` created the implication that -LRB- <PERSON> Healey </PERSON> -RRB- was asked and refused to help <PERSON> Lampinski </PERSON> and that there was enough time for -LRB- him -RRB- to render aid.'' The state court added: `` The evidence could support a finding that -LRB- the newspaper -RRB- knew these implications were false or that it acted in reckless disregard of whether these implications were true or false ... The defamation here really consists of what was left unprinted as well as what was actually printed.'' Using a legal definition employed by other state courts, the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> court said publishing an opinion can be libelous `` if it implies the allegation of undisclosed defamatory facts as the basis for the opinion.'' In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> argued that the legal definition used by the state court violates free-speech rights. `` Only false statements of fact,'' and not the reporting of someone's stated opinion, can be libelous, they said. The newspaper's appeal was supported in a `` friend-of-the-court'' brief sumbitted by five news media organizations _ the <ORGANIZATION> Reporters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Newsletter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Radio-Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION>. They said the Evening Times had been punished `` for attempting to fairly and neutrally report both sides of a controversial local matter.'' The case is <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Healey </PERSON>, 88-1939.

<TEXT>
 Three people convicted of trespassing for handing out anti-abortion booklets to students outside a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> high school lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal today. The court, without comment, let stand rulings that distribution of the `` pro-life'' literature on school grounds was not protected by the Constitution's free-speech guarantees. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> were arrested outside <ORGANIZATION> Friendswood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on Jan. 22, 1987, after refusing to leave. A state jury convicted them of criminal trespass, and a judge sentenced each to 90 days probation and 40 hours of community service. The high school, where more than 1,000 students attend classes, is fronted by a public road that has no adjacent sidewalk. There is no access to students from the roadside because most arrive by car or bus, and are dropped off on school grounds. In the appeal acted on today, the three convicted trespassers contended that their peaceful action before the start of classes should be constitutionally protected. `` The vehicle unloading area and adjacent grounds in front of the school ... should be considered a limited public forum'' where distribution of literature is allowed, the appeal argued. Under past free-speech rulings, a limited public forum is an area opened for use by certain speakers or on certain occasions. But a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> appeals court ruled that the Friendswood High grounds are not any kind of public forum, and the handing out of booklets there is not constitutionally protected. The appeals court upheld the convictions. `` The place is not an area which by tradition has been devoted to public assembly or debate by the general public ... there is no evidence that it had ever been opened by the school authorities as a place for public expressive activity,'' the state court said. It added: `` A limited public forum can not be created ... simply because members of the public are permitted to come and go at will.'' The case is <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 88-2077.

<HEAD>Court Will Hear Pennsylvania Victims' Rights Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said today it will consider placing new limits on the ability of convicted criminals to avoid making restitution to their victims by declaring bankruptcy. The court agreed to hear an appeal by <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> officials seeking to recover $ 4,145 from a couple who pleaded guilty to welfare fraud. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled against <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> welfare officials last March in the case of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> and <PERSON> Debora </PERSON> <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bucks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The Davenports pleaded guilty in 1985 to welfare fraud. Each was sentenced to one year probation and ordered to make monthly restitution payments of $ 208 until $ 4,145 was collected. The Davenports sought protection in 1987 under Chapter 13 of the federal bankruptcy code. As amended by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1978, Chapter 13 is designed to give debtors various court-supervised options to repay part of what they owe and eventually be rid of their debts. A federal bankruptcy judge ruled in 1988 that the couple fulfilled its Chapter 13 obligations without making the restitution payments to the state. The 3rd Circuit court upheld the judge's decision. The appeals court said excusing the <ORGANIZATION> Davenports </ORGANIZATION> from the restitution payments is in line with the 1978 amendments <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> made to the bankruptcy code. Otherwise, the appeals court said, `` restitution conceivably could deplete all the debtor's resources before any distribution is made to the other creditors.'' The appeals court ruling seems to conflict with a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that barred criminals from using another part of the bankruptcy code, Chapter 7, to avoid restitution. Unlike the Chapter 13 provisions, people who declare bankruptcy under Chapter 7 must liquidate their assets. The proceeds then are divided among creditors. The appeals court said the 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling is limited to Chapter 7. The appeals court said Chapter 7, unlike Chapter 13, specifies that `` a fine, penalty or forfeiture payable to and for the benefit of a governmental unit'' is not considered a debt for purposes of bankruptcy. If Chapter 13 improperly creates `` a haven for criminals,'' it is up to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, not the courts, to correct the problem, the appeals court said. `` Where <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has enacted legislation which arguably affects state criminal proceedings, it is not the function of this court to cure any perceived defects in that legislation,'' the appeals court said. In the appeal acted on today, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> officials noted that restitution payments are an option to be considered by sentencing judges in all states, and are required in many states. The case is <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON>, 89-156.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let stand a ruling that allows states to file criminal charges against employers accused of neglecting the health and safety of workers. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling in an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case that federal workplace regulations do not bar such state prosecutions. Five officials of <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magnet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> are awaiting trial on charges they recklessly injured 42 workers by exposing them to toxic chemicals, extreme heat and other unsafe conditions at a wire-coating plant. Prosecutors said conditions at the plant were extremely hazardous, and accused the officials of callously disregarding worker safety. Prosecutors said air in the plant was filled with smoke and chemical fumes, temperatures reached 300 degrees on catwalks and employees were not allowed to wear masks. The state said workers often passed out from the heat and fumes, and on at least one occasion the plant manager laughed at an employee who suffered enamel burns. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Magnet Wire officials argued that the criminal charges should be thrown out because the federal government pre-empted state prosecutions when it enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The officials said permitting such prosecutions would allow `` wholly uninformed and, most likely, wholly unconcerned'' local prosecutors and juries to decide when a factory is unsafe. They said the job should be left to `` experienced and knowledgeable federal officials setting uniform national workplace safety standards.'' Their appeal was supported by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and other business groups that said allowing criminal prosecutions will cause `` regulatory chaos.'' In refusing to squelch the prosecution, the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last February said, `` State criminal law can provide a valuable and forceful supplement to insure that workers are adequately protected and that particular egregious conduct receives appropriate punishment.'' The Chicago Magnet Wire officials indicted were <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, president; <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON>, plant manager; <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Asta </PERSON>, maintenance foreman; <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, plant engineer; and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Colby </PERSON>, an engineering and maintenance supervisor. If convicted, they face maximum sentences of 10 to 20 years in prison. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Asta </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1783.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Farm Worker Issue in Florida Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether farm workers who suffer transportation-related injuries may sue their employers after receiving worker-compensation benefits. The justices said they will review a ruling in the case of 10 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> farm hands that such lawsuits are allowed under a federal law, the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Workers Protection Act. The 10 workers were hurt in 1985 while being transported in a van by their employer, the <ORGANIZATION> Adams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Each collected worker-compensation benefits from <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> under <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law They then sued their employer in federal court, alleging that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> violated the federal law by transporting them in an unsafe van. Lawyers for <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> sought to have the suit dismissed, contending that the state's worker-compensation law made it the exclusive legal remedy for such injuries. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> ruled for <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, concluding that the federal law's motor vehicle safety provisions could not be invoked by workers who had collected worker-compensation benefits. But her ruling was overturned by the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last March 15. `` Both the goal of preventing unsafe transportation practices and the role of private suits in enforcing worker protections convince us that applying -LRB- the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> worker compensation law -RRB- to bar private suits for violations of the -LRB- federal -RRB- act when transportation is covered by worker-compensation insurance would frustrate congressional intent,'' the appeals court said. It added: `` The receipt of worker-compensation benefits does not bar a private suit for actual or statutory damages based on violations of the act. The amount of worker-compensation benefits, however, may be considered in awarding actual damages.'' Lawyers for <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said the 11th Circuit court's ruling conflicts with a decision by the 4th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in a case from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. In it, the 4th Circuit court ruled that a farm worker injured when sprayed by pesticides could not sue under the federal law after receiving worker-compensation benefits. Because of the conflicting rulings, the appeal said, `` it is now impossible for farmers across the nation to know to what extent they must protect themselves from ... additional losses.'' The case is <ORGANIZATION> Adams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, 88-2035.

<HEAD>Court Says States May Require Auto Insurance Despite Religious Convictions</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let states require automobile insurance for motorists who say it violates their religious convictions. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> man who believes having insurance belittles a promise from God to provide in any situation. <PERSON> Lindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Reliance </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, was stopped by a state trooper in January 1988 while driving on a road closed because of a blizzard. When he did not produce proof he had car insurance, <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON> was charged with violating a state law requiring motorists to `` maintain financial responsibility'' for motor vehicles. The law requires either liability insurance or the posting of a $ 75,000 bond or $ 50,000 certificate of deposit to protect others who might be injured by a motorist. <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON> pleaded not guilty, saying that since 1972 he has refused, because of his religious beliefs, all forms of insurance. As evidence of his sincerity, <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON> said he and his wife refused free insurance from their employers. <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON> was fined $ 75, and his license could be revoked under the state law. The <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in May that while <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON>'s religious beliefs apparently are sincere, the state has a legitimate interest in requiring car insurance. The law `` is clearly designed to protect the public,'' the state court said. Without the law, damages caused by car accidents `` could be borne by the public at large rather than those who are responsible,'' the state court said. It added that the options of a bond or certificate of deposit permit <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON> to maintain financial responsibility for his driving without purchasing insurance. But <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON> said the bond or the certificate would be a tremendous economic burden for him. The alternatives `` place an unmistakable burden on <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON>'s free exercise of his religious beliefs,'' his lawyers said They also argued that the state's interest in requiring insurance is less than compelling because many motorists _ tourists from out of state, for example _ are permitted to drive without insurance. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, by a 4-4 vote, barred <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> officials from requiring a driver's license photograph for a woman who believes the Bible forbids such a `` graven image.'' But that tie vote, while upholding a lower court ruling in favor of the woman, established no national precedent. In other cases, the high court has ruled for individuals whose observance of the Sabbath conflicted with state authority. Last March, the justices unanimously barred states from denying unemployment benefits to people who refuse to work on their Sabbath even if the refusal is based on individual religious belief rather than a religious group's doctrine. The case acted on today is <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, 89-10.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let stand a $ 1.2 million bonus in fees awarded to the lawyers for consumers who sued over allegedly defective transmissions in some <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> cars. The justices, without comment, turned away arguments that federal law does not allow such fee bonuses when lawyers win cases in which there was a substantial risk of non-payment because of a loss. Various lawsuits against <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, each alleging that less efficient engines and transmissions were substituted in certain lines of cars, were consolidated into one `` class action'' case in 1982. The case was settled in 1985 after <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> agreed to establish a $ 17 million fund to be shared by those who sued. A federal judge awarded the consumers' lawyers nearly $ 2 million in fees, to be paid out of the fund. The award was based on time expended and reasonable hourly rates. The judge refused to enhance the fee award as a bonus for taking a risky case on a contingency fee basis, ruling that the federal Magnuson-Moss Act bars any such `` risk multiplier'' of a lawyer's fees The 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> threw out the award ruling last year and ordered the judge to apply a risk multiplier in the GM case. The judge then awarded an additional $ 1.2 million in lawyer fees. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> argued that the appeals court ruling conflicts with language in the Magnuson-Moss Act and with a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision limiting lawyer-fee bonuses. The 7th Circuit court rejected a narrow reading of the federal law's language. The appeals court said the 1987 ruling did not apply to the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> case because a settlement had resulted in a common fund for payments to consumers and their lawyers. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> lawyers called the appeals court ruling a `` patent evasion'' of the 1987 high court ruling. They said the appeals court decision `` will increase the incentive for plaintiffs' attorneys to clog the courts with marginal lawsuits in the hope of recovering large multipliers, while spawning complex litigation over the collateral issue of attorneys' fees.'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal was supported in a `` friend-of-the-court'' brief submitted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counties </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>. The brief noted that state and local governments `` are among the defendants most frequently sued under federal statutes providing for awards of attorney fees.'' The case is <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON>, 88-1848.

 Angolan rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> is calling on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to take a more active diplomatic role to head off the possible collapse of peace talks designed to end the 14-year old civil war in his homeland. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said Sunday he will carry that message to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, other senior administration officials and congressional leaders this week. He said a stronger <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role is appropriate in light of the long history of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic activity in the area. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> knows the players,'' said <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebel group. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will meet with <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> on Thursday `` to discuss current developments in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, including the national reconciliation process in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and the proposals to end the fighting in that country,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> seemed on the verge of a peace settlement in June when representatives of the leftist government and of <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s U.S.-backed rebel movement reached agreement on a cease-fire and on negotiations intended to lead to national reconciliation But the truce broke down in August, with each side blaming the other, and the situation has been aggravated during Zaire-mediated talks by profound differences over what constitutes national reconciliation. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, speaking with two American reporters on Sunday, reaffirmed his view that a settlement can come about only through the creation of a national unity government whose main task would be to arrange for free and fair elections. The government of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, meanwhile, has said reconciliation should consist mainly of the rebels' integration into the existing political and military establishment. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> also said he was prepared to meet with a high-level <ORGANIZATION> Angolan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> delegation, which is due to arrive here on Wednesday. However, in the talks mediated by <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, the two sides have refused to negotiate in the same room. Adding to <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s frustration is the perception among some that <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> has embraced the Angolan government's view of the requirements for peace On Sunday, however, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> declined to criticize <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, concentrating his fire instead on the Angolan government. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s chief supplier of military equipment. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has had troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> since 1975 but in December agreed to withdraw them by 1991 as part of a U.S.-mediated settlement. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been providing military and other assistance to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> since 1986. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said election processes are being used to bring about change in countries as diverse as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, where South African colonial rule is ending, and he said elections are the only guarantee of peace in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. `` The power has to come from the people,'' he said, adding that he is confident the majority of Angolans are on <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>'s side.

<HEAD>High Court Lets Pennsylvania Require Judges to Retire at Age 70</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today allowed <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to require its state judges to retire at age 70. The court, without comment, turned away arguments that such a mandatory retirement age for judges is unconstitutional. The controversy may have had special poignancy at the nation's highest court, where four of the nine justices are over 70 and a fifth will turn 70 next year Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> are over 80. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> is 72, and Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> will turn 70 on April 20. Each has life tenure, as do all federal judges. Since 1968, the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Constitution has required all state judges _ who generally are elected to 10-year terms _ to step down at 70. Four judges challenged the state constitutional provision, saying it conflicts with the equal-protection and due-process guarantees offered in the federal Constitution. But the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last March 1 upheld the mandatory retirement scheme as a rational way to promote legitimate state purposes. The state court identified those purposes as: _ Continually bringing in younger judges while retaining part-time services of retired judges willing and able to help out _ Eliminating unpleasantness of removing aged and disabled judges on an individual selective basis _ Preventing harm caused by senile judges In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the four state judges attacked each stated purpose. `` Removing older judges to make room for younger ones is unfair, legally unsupportable and unwise,'' the appeal argued. `` The public interest is not served by forcing mature, experienced judges off the bench before their elected terms expire.'' It added that because chronological age `` bears no scientific relationship to mental competence,'' a blanket policy on retirement `` denies judges their rights to individualized determinations of their fitness for service.'' Removing the unpleasantness that may accompany such individual determinations `` has never been considered a legitimate excuse for rank discrimination,'' the appeal said. The mandatory retirement is not an effective way of protecting the public from senile judges, the appeal said, because mental incompetence may set in far earlier than someone's 70th birthday. The justices in 1976 upheld a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law requiring mandatory retirement of state police officers at age 50, and in 1979 upheld a federal law requiring mandatory retirement of foreign service officers at age 60. The four state judges who appealed the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> mandatory retirement are <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rauhauser </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfadt </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Eight antiwar activists convicted of breaking into a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> plant, damaging two nuclear missile cones and pouring blood on related documents lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal today. The court, over two dissenting votes, turned down arguments that the activists, known as the `` Plowshares Eight'' after the biblical prophesy that swords will be beaten into plowshares, were denied a fair trial. Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> voted to grant full review to the case, but that left the eight activists two votes short. The eight, including longtime antiwar activist brothers <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrigan </PERSON>, broke into a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> plant in King of <LOCATION> Prussia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, on Sept. 9, 1980. The protesters used hammers to beat the missile cones <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> was manufacturing for the federal government. Prosecutors said the intruders caused about $ 28,000 in damages. In addition to the Berrigans, the defendants were the Rev. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabat </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, a priest with the <ORGANIZATION> Oblate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immaculate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION>; Sister <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, a member of the Relgious Order of the Sacred Heart who taught in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> chaplain; <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Maas </PERSON>, a former music and philosophy professor; <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Rush </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and Peace; and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuchardt </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> lawyer. Each was convicted of burglary, conspiracy and criminal mischief in a 1981 trial in <LOCATION> Norristown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. Sentences ranged up to 3-to-10-year prison terms A state appeals court threw out the convictions after ruling that the eight had been denied a public trial because only news reporters, not members of the general public, were allowed to be in the courtroom during jury selection. The <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reversed that ruling and sent the case back to the appeals court. In late 1987, the appeal court ruled that the trial judge had been biased against the defendants, and ordered resentencing. But it voted 5-4 to uphold the eight convictions. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to hear the activists' ensuing appeal last Feb. 3. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the eight argued that the defendants' right to a fair and public trial was violated by the exclusion of most spectators during the five days in which jurors were selected. `` Exemption of the press from an order closing the courtoom for the first five days of the trial can not relieve the judge's action of its constitutional defect,'' the appeal said. In urging the justices to reject the appeal, <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Killinger </PERSON> said, `` There was no real limitation on the public's access to any information,'' and that the exclusion was ordered to ensure `` a calm and quiet setting.'' Saying that the judge's exclusion order was `` perhaps unwise,'' Ms. <PERSON> Killinger </PERSON> said it `` does not catapult this case into the area of significant and constitutional error'' worthy of the high court's review. The eight activists have not yet been resentenced. All except <PERSON> Kabat </PERSON>, who is serving a prison term for an unrelated conviction, are free on bail. The case is <PERSON> Berrigan </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, 89-5119.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal in Lipton Merger Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today turned its back on a still-brewing tempest over <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s multi-million dollar herbal tea market. The justices, without comment, refused to take up an antitrust controversy stemming from the once-planned acquisition by <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lipton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Celestial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seasonings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The case dates back to 1987, when <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON>, a subsidiary of the huge grocery products distributor <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION>, announced it had agreed to buy Celestial Seasonings from <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Celestial is the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer of herbal teas, accounting for 52 percent of all sales <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> controls the second largest herbal tea market share, 32 percent. Herbal teas are not actually teas but blends of flowers, leaves, roots and stems of edible plants. The blends are steeped in water, yielding a natural, caffeine-free beverage. After it became clear the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was not going to challenge the purchase, competitor R.C. <ORGANIZATION> Bigelow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> sued in federal court to stop it. <PERSON> Bigelow </PERSON>, a family-owned business based in <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, accounts for about 13 percent of the herbal tea market's sales. Its lawsuit contended that the merger of <LOCATION> Lipton </LOCATION> and Celestial would create a monopoly that would hurt <PERSON> Bigelow </PERSON>'s chances of competing effectively in selling herbal teas. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabranes </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, threw out the suit, ruling that <PERSON> Bigelow </PERSON> had not proved the merger would result in predatory pricing or any other antitrust law violation. `` The mere fact that <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> will possess monopoly power after the proposed acquisition is not a sufficient showing that <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> will exercise that power in a way that will cause injury to <PERSON> Bigelow </PERSON>,'' the judge said. His ruling relied heavily on a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that made it more difficult for companies to challenge successfully mergers of their competitors. In that decision, the justices said a business making such a challenge `` must show a threat of antitrust injury'' and that `` a showing of loss or damage due merely to increased competition does not constitute such injury.'' The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last Jan. 17 reinstated the suit. It said the fact that <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> would have an 84 percent share of the herbal tea market after purchasing Celestial `` constitutes sufficient evidence, in and of itself, of antitrust injury to a competitor to create a genuine issue for trial.'' In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> said the 2nd Circuit court's ruling conflicts with the 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision. What practical impact the case, sent back to Judge <PERSON> Cabranes </PERSON> by the appeals court, continues to pack for the herbal tea market is being debated. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> in September 1988 canceled the proposed sale and entered into an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Vestar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a firm specializing in leveraged buyouts, for a management-led buyout of Celestial. <PERSON> Bigelow </PERSON> argued before the 2nd Circuit court that the September sale did not make the case moot because the Lipton-Celestial transaction has not been irrevocably abandoned. <PERSON> Bigelow </PERSON> `` takes the position that there is more than a mere or abstract possibility that <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> will again seek to acquire Celestial,'' the appeals court said. `` We agree.'' The case is <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Bigelow </PERSON>, 88-1948.

 Tornadoes and flooding targeted the hurricane-hammered South today after storms destroyed a trailer park, killing a woman and toddler, and chased scores of people from their homes in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>. A twister tore through <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, early today, tossing a house trailer that stood through the hurricane onto a road and injuring its two occupants. Neither was hurt seriously, said <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Browder </PERSON>, a dispatcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Rain continued to pour throughout the region today, falling on ground already soaked by rain that came with Hurricane Hugo on the night of Sept. 21 and pushing rivers and streams toward flood levels. Three people were missing after high water washed out a bridge and swept a car into a branch of <LOCATION> Richardson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> early today in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, southeast of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. A 17-year-old woman rescued after she was found clinging to branches said three other people were in the car, but no one else was found. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Manous </PERSON>, who grows sod next to the <LOCATION> Etowah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said a flash flood Sunday afternoon sent water 6 feet deep over his field, engulfing two tractors and a brand new one-ton truck. `` We did n't have time to get the tractors out, and it's already up to the windshield on the truck,'' he said. `` It looks like it's been rising a couple of inches every 15 minutes. A tornado touched down in a mobile home park near <LOCATION> Moultrie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, on Sunday, killing trailer park residents <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, 45, and 2-year-old <PERSON> Brittany </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, injuring 12 and destroying a church and social hall. At least nine mobile homes were destroyed by the tornado, which cut a 10-mile path through the south <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> countryside, said <LOCATION> Colquitt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>. After demolishing the mobile home park, the twister tore up a stand of timber and then flattened the <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the church's social hall. Strong winds that may have been a tornado chased residents from their homes Sunday night in <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Swan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> southeast of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, authorities said. A count of the evacuaees was unavailable. About 80 families were evacuated from homes around <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, by rising waters Sunday night. Water washed into yards and into some homes, authorities said. To the east, 80 people fled a mobile home park near <LOCATION> McAdenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, as <ORGANIZATION> Crowders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> overflowed its banks. `` The water just kept rising,'' said <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Haney </PERSON> as she left with her husband and three young daughters. In <LOCATION> Anderson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, flooding forced the temporary evacuation of about 100 people, said <PERSON> Sheriff </PERSON>'s Lt. <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON>. More than 13 inches of rain has fallen on the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area the past week, with weekend downpours flooding creeks and rivers, closing numerous roads.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected an appeal by older <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> inspectors who say they are being forced illegally to transfer to other cities. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the inspectors are not victims of illegal age discrimination. The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which employs more than 1,900 inspectors, has faced a problem of chronic staff shortages in 14 major metropolitan areas. The service in 1980 adopted what it calls its career path policy to ease the big-city shortages. Inspectors are urged to volunteer for work in the big cities. As an incentive, inspectors who have spent two years in one of the big cities are exempt from similar transfers later on when they reach senior-level status. Also, anyone who has served five years in one of the 14 metropolitan areas is eligible to be asked for reassignment. Another provision of the career path policy puts senior-level inspectors who have not worked in the big cities at the top of the list for involuntary transfers. It is that so-called senior-first rule that was challenged by the older inspectors. They said the policy disproportionately harms inspectors over age 40. A federal judge ruled that the provision violates the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which is aimed at protecting older workers against arbitrary bias. The judge's ruling was overturned in December 1988 by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here. The appeals court said the senior-first rule should not be examined in isolation. `` The senior-first rule was not a free-standing element of an employment program,'' the appeals court said. `` Under the career path policy, every -LRB- senior-level -RRB- employee was expected to spend five years in a major metropolitan area. Thus, each -LRB- senior-level -RRB- employee can fulfill this uniform service requirement through either an early voluntary, or a later involuntary, transfer.'' The appeals court said the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> properly refused to adopt an alternative system of random transfers because that would have reduced the incentive for voluntary moves to big cities. In the appeal acted on today, the senior inspectors said they have been hit with significant hardship by the transfer rule. After living for years in the same location, they said the system forced them to uproot their families and move to areas with a higher cost of living. Regardless of the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s motives, the senior inspectors said the senior-first rule is illegal because it has a disproportionate impact on older workers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration lawyers urged the justices to reject the appeal, saying, the system `` ensures that the burdens of employment are distributed fairly while giving postal inspectors as much control as possible over their careers.'' The case is <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> vs. Postmaster General, 89-8.

<HEAD>President of Nauru in South Pacific Loses Bid to Revive Libel Suit</HEAD>

 The president of the tiny <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> republic </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION> today lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal aimed at reviving his libel lawsuit against a Guam newspaper. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that President <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> <PERSON> DeRoburt </PERSON> was not libeled by the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, reported in 1978 that DeRoburt secretly made an illegal $ 600,000 loan to a <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> political faction that favored separating the islands from <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> DeRoburt </PERSON> said the article and a related one were false. He said the loan was legal, was a matter of public record and was made before <PERSON> DeRoburt </PERSON> was elected president. <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION> is an indepedent island nation of about eight square miles with some 4,000 residents. It is among the wealthiest nations per capita because of vast phosphate deposits. After years of legal maneuvering, a federal jury in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> decided in favor of the newspaper in 1985. The jury found that <PERSON> DeRoburt </PERSON> failed to prove actual malice _ that the newspaper knowingly printed falsehoods or acted with reckless disregard for the truth. A key issue in the case was the identity of two confidential sources relied on by the newspaper. DeRoburt at one point alleged that the sources did not exist. His lawyers wanted the jury told it could presume there were no sources. But during trial, the reporter who wrote the first article named two sources, including one who by that time had died. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the jury verdict in October 1988. The appeals court said DeRoburt's lawyers, in effect, abandoned their claim that no sources existed. They `` chose to present -LRB- DeRoburt's -RRB- case in a manner inconsistent with a theory of no sources,'' the appeals court said. For the judge `` to then instruct the jury that it should conclusively presume that there were no sources would have been contrary to the evidence presented at trial by both parties and contrary to the truth,'' the appeals court said. In the appeal acted on today, <PERSON> DeRoburt </PERSON> urged the justices to overturn their 1964 ruling that established the `` actual malice'' defense in libel suits filed by public officials. In the alternative, DeRoburt's lawyers said the burden of proving there was no actual malice should be shifted to the newspaper when it has withheld, concealed or destroyed relevant evidence. DeRoburt alleged that the reporter who wrote the first 1978 article destroyed his notes. The case is DeRoburt vs. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>, 89-9.

 An evangelical Christian group ordered to return most of the $ 6.5 million donated by a wealthy ex-member lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal today. The court, without comment, let stand rulings that the group, The Bible Speaks, received the donations after exerting undue influence on department store heiress <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>. The group now must return $ 5.5 million. At issue was whether allowing Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON> to rescind her gifts, made over a 12-month period ending in late 1985, violates the The Bible Speaks' religious freedom. The Bible Speaks was based in <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and was led by founder <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. The Bible Speaks claimed 1,200 members worldwide until it disbanded in the summer of 1987. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> has since moved to the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> area, where the church has been revived under the name The Greater Grace. The Bible Speaks appeal was supported in `` friend-of-the-court'' briefs submitted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, comprised of 32 national <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and Eastern Orthodox churches, and by television evangelist <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s Old-Time Gospel Hour. Lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> said Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>' legal victory `` is not just ominous for religious liberty, but devastating.'' Lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> Old-Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gospel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hour </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s related ministries received more than $ 100 million in gifts in the fiscal year that ended June 31 and in recent fiscal years had received at least one gift of over $ 1 million. `` No surer way to destroy the churches of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> could be found,'' they said, `` than to permit the courts to strip them of gifts ... by allowing a wealthy, disaffected donor to reclaim a gift.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>, an heir to the <ORGANIZATION> Dayton-Hudson </ORGANIZATION> fortune, grew up in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Some years ago, after moving to <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION> in 1981 with her husband, she assessed her personal wealth at about $ 19 million. Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON> joined The Bible Speaks in 1982. Within a three-year period, Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON> gave The Bible Speaks over $ 6.5 million _ including major donations of $ 5 million, $ 1 million and $ 500,000. Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>' family, after inviting her to her father's birthday party in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> in late 1985, hired two `` deprogrammers'' to talk to her She later left The Bible Speaks, and sued to have her gifts returned. A federal trial judge ordered the religious group to return $ 6.5 million, but the 1st <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled that only $ 5.5 million must be returned. The appeal acted on today challenged only that portion of the appeals court decision concerning the $ 5 million gift. Lawyers for The Bible Speaks said the lower court rulings threaten all religious groups. `` But they are of especially grave concern to evangelical and fundamentalist religious communities,'' the appeal said. `` Their non-mainstream character renders them particularly vulnerable to bias and misunderstanding, both conscious and unconscious, in tort and restitution suits brought by apostate members, particularly former members who have undergone extensive professional deprogramming,'' the appeal said. The case is The Bible Speaks vs. Dovydenas, 88-1977.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Disturb Virginia's Ban on Funeral Phone Solicitation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to disturb a state's ban on telephone solicitation for pre-arranged funerals. The court, without comment, rejected arguments by an insurance firm and two funeral directors that such a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law violates their free-speech rights. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last March upheld a 1951 <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law banning the telephoning of potential customers to line up funeral business. The appeals court said the Constitution permits such restrictions on commercial speech. The law was challenged by <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an insurance-funded funeral program, and two funeral homes that participate in the plan. Guardian sells pre-arranged, or `` pre-need'' funerals by including in the company's life insurance policies benefits to pay for funerals. When a policyholder dies, the family must agree to release the policy proceeds to a funeral home. Guardian said the plan is intended to be humane and a help to customers, sparing family members the anguish of deciding how much to pay for a funeral at the time of a loved one's death. But the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funeral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embalmers </ORGANIZATION>, saying it was trying to protect consumers, complained about the soliciting of business over the phone. Guardian and its participating funeral homes said the state board is influenced by the funeral industry, and that the ban on phone solicitations is a ploy to reduce competition. The 4th Circuit court said, `` The <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> statute leaves open ample alternatives for -LRB- Guardian and its plan participants -RRB- to advertise their services. Consequently, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s ban on telemarketing does not violate the First Amendment.'' Guardian's appeal was supported by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 2,000 funeral homes nationwide. The association's lawyers cited a statement by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> officials that restricting such telephone solicitations is anti-competitive. The case is Guardian Plans vs. <PERSON> Teague </PERSON>, 89-38.

<HEAD>Court Won't Hear Alaska's Appeal to Stop Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s attempt to forestall offshore oil and gas exploration in its <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> suffered a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> setback today. The court, over one dissenting vote, left intact rulings that allowed the federal government last year to sell leases on 5.6 million acres of <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s southwestern coast. Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> voted to hear arguments in the case but four votes are needed to grant such review. The court turned away warnings by <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> and others that an oil spill in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> could do more environmental harm than the massive Exxon Valdez spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> last March. The disputed leases were sold for nearly $ 100 million after a federal judge and the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> rejected a challenge by <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> and numerous enviromental groups, fishing associations and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> communities. The federal government first began considering oil and gas leasing in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aleutian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, which underlies <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, in 1974. After twice canceling plans for lease sales in the bay at <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s request, the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 proposed leasing all 32.5 million acres, beginning in 1985. The secretary, in response to concerns expressed by <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> officials, later restricted the leasing to the southwest corner of the region by deleting nearly 83 percent of the acreage from the sale. Under the federal Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> must give the governor of any affected state a chance to make recommendations about any proposed lease sale. The governor recommended that the federal government delay selling any <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> leases for eight years, and then not sell any tracts within 25 miles of shore. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary rejected both recommendations, sparking the lawsuit. The appeal acted on today contended that the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary violated the continental shelf law because his rejection of the state's recommendations was `` arbitrary and capricious.'' In the appeal, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Baily </PERSON> referred to last March's oil spill by the grounded tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> as a dramatic example of `` the devastating impact of oil on biological resources.'' `` <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aleutian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> are substantially more remote and inaccessible than -LRB- Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> -RRB-, the weather is much more problematic ... efforts to clean up an oil spill in this area accordingly would be even less successful than in the sound,'' the appeal said. It accused the federal government of not striking `` a proper balance ... between satisfying the nation's thirst for oil and gas and protecting one of the most biologically productive and important areas in the world.'' The appeal was supported by the attorneys general of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration urged the justices to reject the appeal. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said federal law gives the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary _ not a governor _ the authority to make a final decision on lease sales. The case is <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> vs. Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>, 88-2000.

<HEAD>Court Rejects San Francisco Policemen's Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to hear an appeal by <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> policemen who say they lost out on promotions due to unfair preferences given to women and minorities. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the officers, mostly white men, are not the victims of reverse bias who are entitled to promotions. The case stems from a 1973 lawsuit in behalf of women and racial minorities who said the city's police department discriminated against them. That suit was settled in 1979, when the city agreed to hire and promote more women and minorities within the police department, and to use unbiased promotion tests. The city in 1983 gave a test for promotion to sergeant and inspector that included multiple-choice questions, essays and an oral exam. But when the scores of women and minorities scored disproportionately lower than white males, city officials changed the test results. More weight was given to the oral exam so that more women and minorities would be promoted. The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and officers whose scores were downgraded sued. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in March that revising the test scores was illegal discrimination, but it refused to order promotions for any officers whose test scores were lowered as a result. The appeals court said the test as originally scored violated the 1979 court order since the exam adversely affected minorities and women. `` The persons who did well on it did not acquire any rights,'' the appeals court said. It added that those people who benefitted when the scores were changed may not be penalized by having to give up promotions in favor of those with higher original scores. Instead, the appeals court ordered the city not to change test scores in this manner again. The 9th Circuit court noted that the city conceded it is illegal to revise scoring standards after test results are compiled. The case is <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> vs. City and County of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, 88-1984.

<HEAD>High Court Rejects Abandoned Property Case from Connecticut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to bar states from using abandoned property laws to recover some unclaimed insurance benefits. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by an insurance company ordered to turn over to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> $ 2.5 million in unclaimed benefits. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last February that the state's power to collect the money is not pre-empted by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act -LRB- ERISA -RRB-, which regulates pensions and other employee benefit programs. <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which provides group health and accident coverage for workers, said it should be allowed to keep unclaimed benefits and use the money to lower its premiums or increase benefits. The insurance company said tens of millions of dollars could be at stake if all states sought to recover unclaimed benefits. <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> in 1981 amended its laws on abandoned property _ or escheating _ to enable the state to acquire property left unclaimed after three, rather than seven, years. The state said <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> must turn over to it $ 2.5 million in unclaimed benefits. A federal judge ruled in favor of <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> but the 2nd Circuit court reversed that decision. `` We think that the impact of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s escheat law on <ORGANIZATION> ERISA </ORGANIZATION> benefit plans is too tenuous, remote and peripheral to require pre-emption'' of the state law by the federal statute, the appeals court said. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Borges </PERSON>, 88-1883.

<HEAD>Jury-Selection Decision Expanded in 3 Southern States</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today allowed its decision barring prosecutors from excluding potential jurors based on their race to be applied to all non-criminal trials in three southern states. The justices, over one dissenting vote, let stand a federal appeals court ruling in a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> case that extended their 1986 decision to all civil trials. Although today's action sets no national precedent. It leaves intact a binding precedent for courts in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> voted to hear arguments in the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> case but four votes are needed to grant such review. The justices in 1986 curtailed dramatically the traditionally broad power of prosecutors to bar prospective jurors from trials by using `` peremptory'' or automatic challenges. The court ruled that the exclusion of potential jurors from any criminal trial because of their race violates the equal-protection rights of defendants and of those people excluded. At the time of the ruling, legal experts said it likely would not apply to peremptory challenges made by defense lawyers in criminal trials or to any civil, or non-criminal, trial. But the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last Jan. 17 took a much more expansive view of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1986 ruling. The appeals court reinstated a lawsuit filed by a black man against the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, deputy sheriff who shot him. The appeals court said the trial judge must determine whether the deputy sheriff's lawyer used two peremptory challenges to exclude black potential jurors for non-racial reasons. `` We hold that -LRB- the 1986 ruling -RRB- applies in civil as well as criminal cases,'' said the 11th Circuit court, which has jurisdiction over <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Some government action must be present for the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection to be violated, but the appeals court said such a violation can be found even in a lawsuit in which neither the government nor a government employee is involved `` When blacks are excluded from jury service on account of their race ... the trial judge constitutes the discriminatory state actor,'' the appeals court said. Although the appeals court did not say so, the decision's rationale would appear to mean that the prohibition against race-based juror exclusions applies to criminal defense lawyers as well In the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> case, deputy sheriff <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiller </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fludd </PERSON> while attempting to apprehend a suspected narcotics trafficker. <PERSON> Fludd </PERSON> sued <PERSON> Tiller </PERSON> in federal court under a much-used civil rights law. The case is <PERSON> Tiller </PERSON> vs. Fludd, 88-2088.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilot fired for operating a commercial jet while drunk lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal today in his effort to win back his job. The justices, over one dissenting vote, let stand lower court rulings that the pilot's reinstatement would be contrary to public policy. A labor arbitration board previously had ordered his reinstatement. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> voted to hear arguments in the case but four votes are needed to grant such review. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, a Boston-based pilot for <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, was fired in 1985 after airline officials discovered he had been drunk while commanding a flight from <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The flight was without incident. Shortly after his firing, Day was medically diagnosed as an alcoholic. After treatment, he was recertified by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Day challenged his firing, and under the terms of a contract <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and his union, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, his grievance was submitted to a five-member arbitration board. Comprised of two members appointed by the airline, two appointed by the union and one neutral chairman, the board split 3-2 in finding that Day had been fired without `` just cause.'' Although stating that Day was guilty of serious misconduct, the board concluded that he should have been offered the option of enrolling in <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s alcohol rehabilitation program. The board ordered his reinstatement without back pay. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> challenged the board's reinstatement order in federal court, and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orinda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> overturned the board. `` Requiring Delta to cooperate with Day and the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> in recertifying Day is violative of public policy,'' the judge ruled. The 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld that ruling last Dec. 8. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> argued that the lower court rulings conflict with a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that limited the power of federal judges to overrule labor arbitrators. In that decision, the court ruled unanimously that judges may reverse an arbitration award for public-policy reasons only if the award creates an explicit conflict with laws or legal precedent. Such judicial reversals can not be based on `` general considerations f supposed public interest,'' the justices said in their 1987 ruling. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the pilots' union called the lower court rulings examples of `` the continuing erosion of the doctrine of finality of arbitration awards.'' They urged the justices to restore the arbitration board ruling that would reinstate Day. The case is <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, 88-1901.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to impose a one-inmate-per-cell limit at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> prison in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The justices, without comment, let stand a state appeals court ruling that putting two prisoners in one cramped cell does not amount to constitutionally impermissible `` cruel and unusual punishment.'' Inmates sued state officials in 1981, challenging the double-celling and other conditions at the maximum-security prison. Between 1977 and 1982, the number of inmates at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> grew from 2,000 to 3,400. By early 1983, the prison's general population was 153 percent of design capacity. In the same years, the rate of violent incidents at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> increased dramatically. While the prison's general population grew by 46 percent, treatments for assault-related injuries increased by 519 percent. Reported assaults, suicides and weapons-possession incidents grew by 193 percent during the same period. State Judge <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Savitt </PERSON> in 1983 declared the conditions at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> to comprise cruel and unusual punishment. Among other things, she ordered state prison officials to stop putting two prisoners in cells designed for one. The cells are six feet wide, eight feet deep and eight feet high. When two inmates are held inside such a cell, each prisoner has less than nine square feet of usable space. A state appeals court reversed <PERSON> Savitt </PERSON>'s double-celling ruling last Dec. 12. `` The blanket ban on double celling can not be sustained,'' the appeals court ruled. Noting the surge in prison violence, the appeals court said, `` The evidence does not support the finding that double celling itself was the cause of the increase.'' The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to review the inmates' appeal last March 23 The state appeals court relied heavily on a 1981 decision by the nation's highest court that upheld the use of double celling in an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> prison. In that ruling, the justices said double celling in cells designed for one prisoner is not necessarily unconstitutional. The case is <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, 88-2090.

 Rain, floods and a tornado dealt cruel new blows today to those trying to rebuild their lives and towns devastated by Hurricane Hugo. The latest weather assault came amid a torrent of volunteer aid from across the country, an effort boosted Sunday by a $ 1,000 check by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Northeast of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, a twister tore through the town of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> early today, tossing a house trailer that had stood through the hurricane onto a road and injuring its two occupants. Neither was hurt seriously, said <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Browder </PERSON>, a dispatcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` The trailer was slung across the road,'' she said. `` I'm sure most of their injuries were mental, not physical. They probably got through the hurricane all right, then to have this happen.'' Heavy rain fell throughout <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on Sunday and into early today, hampering cleanup efforts and forcing temporary evacuation of 100 people in <LOCATION> Anderson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in the state's northwest corner No injuries were reported, and the people returned to their homes when the flood threat eased a few hours later. Rain in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> subsided by midmorning after about 2 -LCB- inches fell on <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, 10 miles away, about 2 inches of rain backed up storm sewers, scattered debris and hampered cleanup efforts. `` I feel sorry for people. It's terrible. It adds insult to injury,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Schenot </PERSON>, meteorologist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Torrential rain also fell on <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> residents trying to clean up <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s wreckage, and trees left leaning by the hurricane leaned farther or fell because of saturated soil. The rain in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caroline </LOCATION> also swept a car into a creek, leaving three people missing, and forced scores of people to evacuate. Disaster followed catastrophe in <LOCATION> Greeleyville </LOCATION>, when a gasoline tanker truck exploded Sunday, injuring two and forcing 150 people to flee their homes for three hours for fear of an explosion in underground storage tanks. The town of 720 was battered by Hurricane Hugo as it tore across the state. `` It would be terrible any time, but in connection with everything else we've had, I'm sure it hit us a lot harder,'' <LOCATION> Greeleyville </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Browder </PERSON> said of the blast. The truck exploded Sunday as its driver was about to start pumping gas into storage tanks at a convenience store, leaving the driver with second - and third-degree burns and the store owner with minor burns and bruises The cause was n't known. Residents of hard-hit <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> took time out Sunday to salute volunteers who have chipped in with money and goods and traveled to the historic city to help cut away splintered trees, clear debris and lend a hand with other cleanup chores. `` What you're doing will never be forgotten,'' Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> told hundreds of weary workers who gathered at a rally Sunday despite drizzle. `` People from all over the country came to help a community in need. We might have suffered some damage, but our spirit is alive.'' Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, planned to tour the damaged areas by helicopter and work at disaster centers in Moncks Corner and <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> this afternoon and Tuesday. Hugo, which belted the city Sept. 21 with 135 mph winds, where more than 2,500 historically significant buildings were damaged. `` These people need help,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Desin </PERSON>, a volunteer who came to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> directly from working on the Alaskan oil spill cleanup. `` This is what makes this country what it is. You can kick our butts, but we'll fight back.'' The <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, native sent four vessels from his <ORGANIZATION> Cheetah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to ferry food, clothes and medicine to offshore islands cut off by the storm. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which had 10 disaster application centers open Sunday, planned to add four more centers today, officials said. As of Sunday, 5,400 residents had applied for various forms of federal and state assistance. Also today, beachfront property owners in <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, were told they could begin applying for permits to repair seawalls, homes and businesses that were less than two-thirds damaged by the hurricane. The Beachfront Management Act, enacted in 1988 to limit development along <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s 187-mile coast over bitter opposition from many property owners, prohibits rebuilding or repairs on shore structures that are more than two-thirds damaged. About 5,500 structures in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> were damaged or destroyed, said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gress </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which enforces the law.

<HEAD>Cancer Institute Says Drug Combination Aids Colon Cancer Patients</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A drug used to deworm farm animals combined with a common cancer drug has been found to save the lives of patients who would have died from an advanced type of colon cancer, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> announced today. <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Broder </PERSON> said that a national study involving about 1,300 patients with a stage 3 type of colon cancer showed increased survival rates for those treated with a drug called levamisole in combination with 5-fluorouracil, a cancer drug now in common use. The study was directed by Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moertel </PERSON> of the Mayo Clinic. At a news conference today, <PERSON> Moertel </PERSON> said that the study showed 49 percent of stage III colon cancer patients were alive five years after therapy with the drug combination compared to only 37 percent of such patients who received no drugs. Both of the patient groups being compared had been treated with surgery, which revealed that the colon cancer had spread to nearby lymph nodes. In cancer therapy this stage of the disease is called <PERSON> Dukes </PERSON>' C. With today's announcement, <PERSON> Broder </PERSON> said that physicians are encouraged to discuss this treatment option with patients at this stage of colon cancer. He said the combination drug therapy is started three to five weeks after surgery and is continued for about a year. <PERSON> Levamisole </PERSON> is a drug that is used by veterinarians to clear worms from the intestine of barnyard animals. It is not now approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for any human use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The drug, however, is commonly used in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to treat worm infestation in humans and it has been used widely in experimental treatment of cancers. <PERSON> Moertel </PERSON> said the drug combination of levamisole and 5-fluorouracil has not been proven effective against colon cancers at an earlier stage in the disease or for those whose surgeries occurred at a much earlier time. <PERSON> Broder </PERSON> said a specific description of this new treatment method is being mailed to doctors around the country and that physicians may obtain levamisole through the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 About 25,000 blacks demanded clemency for two condemned <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas today in the largest protest march ever held in one of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s nominally independent tribal homelands. The marchers, most of them schoolchildren, paraded peacefully through the center of <LOCATION> Umtata </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION>. Some carried <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> flags and displayed placards urging the release of two members of the guerrilla movement who are on death row in <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION> for a 1986 bombing which killed two people at the <ORGANIZATION> Wild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>, a posh gambling resort overlooking the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. The homeland's official radio estimated the crowd at 25,000 and said police did not interfere. The protest came a day after <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION>'s military leader, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Bantu </PERSON> <PERSON> Holomisa </PERSON>, declared at a funeral service that he would consider holding a referendum to let homeland voters decide if they wanted to rejoin <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The Star, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s largest daily newspaper, said the government faced a `` major challenge to its grand apartheid plan'' if <PERSON> Holomisa </PERSON> proceeded with a referendum. The result, said The Star, would be an overwhelming vote to rejoin <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, thus repudiating the white government's longstanding contention that blacks preferred autonomy in separate ethnic states. The homeland system also came under heavy criticism Sunday in <LOCATION> Botshabelo </LOCATION>, a vast rural shantytown in the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> which the government has placed under the jurisdiction of Qwaqwa, one of six semi-autonomous homelands. An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 of <PERSON> Botshabelo </PERSON>'s 500,000 residents marched in protest against their incorporation into Qwaqwa, which is 180 miles from their community. Many Botshabelo residents fear Qwaqwa may be declared independent, thus depriving them of South African citizenship. Like many other blacks, they feel <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, despite its segregation laws, offers better opportunities than the impoverished homelands in regard to pensions, employment and housing. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 28 million blacks have voting rights only in the homelands and in local elections. National policy is controlled by the 5 million whites. <PERSON> Holomisa </PERSON>, at the funeral Sunday of a tribal chief who opposed <ORGANIZATION> Transkei </ORGANIZATION>'s independence, shared a podium for the first time with prominent anti-apartheid activists. Speakers at the service denounced the homeland system and praised the late chief, <PERSON> Sabata </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalindyebo </PERSON>, for his staunch opposition to the excision of <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1976. <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION> was the first of four homelands to accept `` independence'' from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as part of a plan by white officials to create separate nations for each major black tribe. None of the four are recognized internationally. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, declined to comment on <PERSON> Holomisa </PERSON>'s statement, saying he had received no official communication from <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION>. A ministry official, requesting anonymity, said any bid by <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION> to renounce its independence would be a matter for negotiations between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the homeland. <PERSON> Holomisa </PERSON>, 34, took power in <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION> in a bloodless coup in 1987. He is the first leader of a nominally independent homeland to make favorable references to the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and he reportedly held secret talks earlier this year with the group's exiled president, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON> <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION> lies along <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s southern coast between the port cities of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether police nationwide may try to curb drunken driving by stopping motorists at sobriety checkpoints. The justices said they will review <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> court rulings that struck down that state's sobriety checkpoint program as an unconstitutional invasion of privacy. Courts in other states have upheld virtually identical checkpoint programs. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> state police first used sobriety checkpoints, modeled after a program used in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, in 1986. At a checkpoint site, police directed all traffic headed in one direction to a roadside area where officers checked motorists for signs of intoxication. If there was no immediate evidence of intoxication, the motorist was given a traffic safety brochure and allowed to drive away. The average delay was about 30 seconds. If some signs of intoxication were detected, a driver was directed to another area for further questioning and perhaps a breath test. At one such checkpoint, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> state police troopers checked 126 vehicles in less than an hour and detained two drivers for sobriety field tests. One driver was arrested on drunken-driving charges. The state police department was sued soon after the checkpoint program began. The lawsuit alleged that the checkpoints violated the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable police searches and seizures. A state judge and a state appeals court ruled that the checkpoint program was unconstitutional. The appeals court cited `` the potential for an unreasonable subjective intrusion on individual liberty interests.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last Feb. 22 refused to review the lower court rulings. In other action today, the court: _ Agreed to decide whether public employers may be forced to put aside partisanship when hiring, promoting and transferring workers. The court said it will hear an appeal by two men and a woman who said their job status suffered because they did n't support the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. _ Let states file criminal charges against employers accused of neglecting the health and safety of workers. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling in an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case that federal workplace regulations do not bar such state prosecutions. _ Agreed to consider increasing the federal government's power to keep some accused criminals behind bars while they await trial. The court said it will review a ruling in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> case that forces the government to free, on bail, some defendants deemed to be dangerous or a risk to flee before trial. _ Turned aside an appeal by three people convicted of trespassing for handing out anti-abortion booklets to students outside a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> high school. The court, without comment, let stand rulings that distribution of the `` pro-life'' literature on school grounds was not protected by the Constitution's free-speech guarantees. _ Turned away an appeal by an evangelical <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> group ordered to return most of the $ 6.5 million donated by a wealthy ex-member. The court, without comment, let stand rulings that the group, The Bible Speaks, received the donations after exerting undue influence on department store heiress <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>. The religious group now must return $ 5.5 million. _ Refused to revive an allegedly abused foster child's federal lawsuit against the social workers and government agency that placed him in his foster home. The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court ruling in a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> case that no such right to sue exists. _ Turned away appeals by eight Mafia figures from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> convicted in the 1979 killings of crime chieftain <PERSON> Carmine </PERSON> <PERSON> Galante </PERSON> and two of his associates. The court, without comment, let stand the federal racketeering convictions of family bosses <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Corallo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carmine </PERSON> <PERSON> Persico </PERSON>, high-ranking mobsters <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Santoro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Furnari </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gennaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Langella </PERSON>, and mob members <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Indelicato </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Scopo </PERSON>. In the sobriety-checkpoint appeal acted on today, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> referred to the `` grave and legitimate public interest'' in fighting drunken driving. He asked the justices to resolve conflictig state court rulings. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s checkpoint program is valid even if it is not the most effective police procedure available or may carry the `` potential of generating fear and surprise in some motorists.'' The state police department's appeal was supported in `` friend-of-the-court'' briefs submitted by the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> chapter of <ORGANIZATION> Mothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Driving </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibilities </ORGANIZATION> and a group called Remove Intoxicated Drivers. Lawyers for those who successfully challenged the checkpoint program urged the justices to reject the appeal. They said the `` warrantless, suspicionless siezure'' of a vehicle at a sobriety checkpoint could lead to drivers and passengers being required to get out and being subjected to pat-down searches. They said police officers may use such occasions to inspect a vehicle's contents. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1979 barred police from randomly stopping vehicles to check registration papers. In that case, officers had total discretion over which vehicles were stopped. But the 1979 decision in a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> case did not rule out spot checks in which an officer's discretion was not so unconstrained. `` Questioning of all oncoming traffic at road block-type stops is one possible alternative,'' the decision said. The case acted on today is <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Sitz </PERSON>, 88-1897.

 <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, a Republican consultant with ties to Presidents <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel today he `` played by the rules'' in obtaining lucrative, multimillion-dollar federal housing subsidies. <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> came under sharp and hostile questioning today in his second appearance before the House Government Operations subcommittee on employment and housing, the panel that has been investigating influence-peddling and mismanagement at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, a former campaign adviser to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and ex-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and a former business partner of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, failed to recall all the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> projects he was involved in when he appeared before the same panel last June, and later sent two letters recounting additional projects. He told the subcommittee today that he and others at his lobbying firm _ Black, <LOCATION> Manafort </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> _ had failed to fully check all of the firm's records and had initially overlooked some projets, but not had disclosed them all. He underwent extensive quetioning about a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> housing project which he purchased, with other partners, after first obtaining commitments from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> for more than $ 31 million in renovation subsidies and tax credits. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the panel, pressed <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> for details of the deal and suggested that <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> and his partners enjoyed an inside line to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials and benefitted from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> specifications that were written to exclude other developers `` It was a tailor-made award,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, however, said his firm `` has worked within the existing system at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` We played by the rules,'' <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> said. `` I understand that the subcommittee views the process as fundamentally flawed. I am not here to argue with the subcommittee about the process, or to defend it ...'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said subcommittee staffers inspected the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> housing project in <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, last week and found conditions `` shocking'' and `` a slum.'' He said one mother had no refrigerator in her apartment, which rented with federal subsidies for $ 700 a month. <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> said the project was still under renovation and asserted, `` When we are finished with construction, we believe the tenants will be happy.'' Also scheduled to testify were two employees of <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>'s firm, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Gay </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> said had met with <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> when she was executive assistant to then-Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Also appearing was <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON>, a partner with <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> housing project in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> In previous testimony before the subcommittee, some local officials have said they opposed the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> project which <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> won subsidies for. `` It's a very peculiar case of influence-peddling,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said. Testifying in June, <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> acknowledged that his work on that project amounted to influence-peddling. <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> said his <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, lobbying firm of Black, <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> did relatively little <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> business. But in following weeks, the firm's involvement with developers on projects in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> came to light. `` <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> said that basically was it,'' said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON>, the subcommittee's staff director. `` Then we got two letters of clarification.'' <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>'s two letters to the panel following his initial appearance detailed more business _ and one of the letters came after a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> report revealed a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> project he had n't mentioned. `` He missed so much that if it were a college exam, he would have failed it,'' <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON> said then. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> last week followed <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> in refusing to testify before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and charging he had been `` prejudged'' by the panel. Two other former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials _ <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s predecessor as executive assistant, <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, and former deputy secretary <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cushing </PERSON> _ have also refused to testify before the subcommittee. Despite their refusal, the subcommittee has not moved to offer immunity from prosecution to any witnesses as a way to break the impasse. <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON> said the refusal `` just means more work for us'' and that the panel will use other witnesses to shed light on the activity of the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> higher-ups. Most panel members have stopped short of calling for a special prosecutor to be named to investigate <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> and are awaiting his second subpoenaed appearance in late October to see if he will change his mind. `` I believe he has a moral obligation, having served as secretary of an important federal agency, to tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people about his activities,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said. `` I very much hope Secretary <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> will testify.''

<HEAD>Illinois Residents Trying to Stop Nuclear Power Plants Lose Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> residents trying to halt operations at three nuclear power plants in the state lost their <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal today. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that the residents' concerns over safety are unfounded. Six people filed a petition with the commission in 1986 seeking the suspension of the operating licenses of three northern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> plants _ Zion, <ORGANIZATION> LaSalle </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON>. The petition voiced concern over the spread of radioactive material from the plants if a nuclear accident occurred. It alleged that inadequate leak-rate testing of containments at the three plants owned by <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had created an unsafe condition. The commission denied the petition after the director of its Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation determined there were no safety problems. The 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last Feb. 3 that it lacked the jurisdiction to second-guess the commission's action. The appeal acted on today contended that the appeals court erred in that conclusion. The residents who initiated the licensing challenge are <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eckhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Festag </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Michetti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sklar </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Court Begins Term With Abortion Issue Heading Closely Watched Cases</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Inserts grafs 19-20, In a, with booklet-distribution case.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> begins its new term much where it left off last summer _ with the issue of abortion heading the list of closely watched cases. After a three-month recess, the justices return to the bench today to begin deliberations in a variety of controversial legal and political disputes. None is likely to be more divisive, or a better bellwether of the court's conservative course, than abortion. The court will hear arguments in three abortion cases, probably in December or January, that will determine whether it will expand the new regulatory power it gave states last July. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Tribe </PERSON> said the July ruling `` began, in a very major way, the dismantling of <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> versus <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>,'' the court's 1973 ruling that established a right to abortion. `` The court may never say <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> versus <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> is overruled, but is likely to say, ` Roe versus <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> ... never heard of it,''' <PERSON> Tribe </PERSON> said. Officials from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> are urging the justices to allow laws requiring young, unmarried girls to get parental consent before having abortions. In the third case, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> is seeking stricter control over clinics that perform the great majority of abortions. The state officials are not asking the court to overturn <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, which legalized abortions nationwide. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which urged the court last term to reverse the 1973 ruling, is taking a lower profile this time. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will not participate in oral arguments in any of the three cases, although it is expected to submit a legal brief supporting <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s parental consent law. The abortion debate in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was recast dramatically by the court's July 3 ruling in a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case cutting back abortion rights and letting states make abortions harder to obtain. The court, by a 5-4 vote, said states may require doctors to administer tests for determining whether a fetus is capable of surviving outside the womb. It also ruled that states may ban even privately paid abortions in public hospitals. Holding the balance of power in that case _ and perhaps for the future of abortion rights _ is <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, the only female justice in the court's history. In a separate concurring opinion in July, she said the Missouri regulations do not place an `` undue burden'' on a woman's right to an abortion. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said she was not prepared to decide then whether the right established 16 years ago now should be discarded. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> are ready to overturn <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> voted to do so. Justices <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> reaffirmed their support of the 1973 holding. The July ruling has made abortion a hotter issue for the state legislatures, where rejuvenated women's rights activists and anti-abortion forces are taking the battle. But the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> remains an important arena for the fight. In a free-speech case, the court today turned aside an appeal by three people convicted of trespassing for handing out anti-abortion booklets to students outside a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> high school. The court, without comment, let stand rulings that distribution of the `` pro-life'' literature on school grounds was not protected by the Constitution's free-speech guarantees. Here is a look at the three abortion cases on the court docket this term: _ The <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Turnock </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Ragsdale </PERSON>, could be the most important The 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> struck down regulations a trial judge said would force abortion clinics to become `` the functional equivalent of small hospitals.'' The clinics, where nearly all early abortions are performed, would be required to provide elaborate medical equipment and services that the clinics say are unnecessary for patient safety. The cost of an abortion could rise by nearly $ 50. The case could have broad significance if the court decides to water down or scrap its trimester approach to abortion rights established by <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. That ruling generally prohibits states from imposing health regulations that make abortions more expensive or difficult to obtain in the first three months of pregnancy. _ In <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, the court will review a system that requires both parents of an unmarried girl under 18 to receive notification from the doctor 48 hours before an abortion is performed Alternatively, the girl may bypass parental notification by convincing a judge she is mature enough to choose abortion for herself. The system was in force for five years before a federal judge ruled it was unconstitutional. But the 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reversed the judge's ruling. _ The second parental notification case, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, raises similar issues An <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law requires the physician to give notice in person or by telephone to one parent 24 hours prior to the abortion, or by regular and certified mail 48 hours in advance. Alternatively, a judge would have up to 22 days to decide whether to permit the minor's abortion. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law, passed in 1985, never took effect before it was struck down by a federal judge whose ruling was upheld by the 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has allowed states to regulate abortions for unmarried minors more strictly than for adult women. The justices, in a decision announced two months before <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> joined the court, split 4-4 in 1987 over the validity of such regulation by <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>State Workers Who Don't Want to Pay Equivalent of Union Dues Lose
Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to hear an appeal by non-union <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> state employees who oppose paying the equivalent of dues to a union that represents them in collective bargaining. The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that the employees' rights were not violated when they were forced to financially support the union's negotiating efforts. The employees are challenging the deduction from their paychecks of what is known as agency fees. The fees average $ 263 a year per worker and are paid in lieu of union dues. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and Municipal Employees -LRB- AFSME -RRB- is the collective-bargaining agent for <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s state employees, union and non-union members alike. The union signed an agrement with state officials July 28, 1988, to deduct the agency fees from some 18,000 non-union employees beginning the following month. Fifteen non-union employees sued in federal court to block the deductions. They said the fees violate their constitutional rights because some of the money would be used to support causes and politicians they do not support _ including Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. After the suit was filed, the union agreed to place the fees in an escrow account _ barring their use by the union _ until an arbitrator decides whether the union may use the money or refund it. The non-union members then sought a court order returning the money to them and barring the union from collecting any further deductions pending outcome of the case. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> denied the injunction last February, ruling that the non-union employees failed to show they will suffer irreparable harm if the fees continue to be placed in escrow. The appeals court relied heavily on a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that set guidelines for the use of agency fees. In that ruling, the justices allowed fee deductions from non-union workers as long as the money is not used, even temporarily, to `` finance ideological activities unrelated to collective bargaining.'' The 3rd Circuit court rejected arguments by the non-union <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> employees that temporarily depriving them of the fees violates their free-speech rights even if the money is held in escrow. The case is Hohe vs. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, 89-51.

 Police fired tear gas and used batons today to disperse about 2,000 Pakistanis who tried to demonstrate at a house where Pakistani Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> is staying during her official visit, witnesses said. The witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said police fired at least 15 rounds of tear gas and used steel-tipped batons when the demonstrators tried to force their way to the state-run guest house. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was in the guest house when the demnonstration occurred. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> Sunday on a three-day visit, the first by a <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> head of government in 15 years. The demonstrators were among the 250,000 people who demand repatriation to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. They opted for Pakistani citizenship in 1971 when <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> became independent by breaking away from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> after a 9-month-long liberation war. The demonstrators wanted to submit a memorandum to Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> pleading their case. The stranded Pakistani live in 66 camps across <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, meanwhile, signed a cultural protocol to promote exchanges on education, information and arts and culture. The agreement was signed after Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> held talks with <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>. Pakistani Foreign Affairs Advisor <PERSON> Iqbal </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhand </PERSON> told reporters that the two leaders held `` free and frank discussions'' on all issues. `` We have no problem between us,'' He said without elaborating. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Anisul </PERSON> <PERSON> Islam </PERSON> said the two leaders would meet again. `` It is a goodwill visit,'' Islam said without elaborating.

<HEAD>Key House Members Tentatively Agree On Clean Air Compromise</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Key House members, breaking a 10-year congressional stalemate, have tentatively agreed to a compromise on clean air legislation that would substantially reduce automobile pollution through 2003, congressional sources said today. The agreement would require the nation to accept standards already approved for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the state with the worst smog pollution problem and the toughest emissions requirements. The anti-smog requirements would remain in effect nationally until 2003, and could be tightened after that if a federal study showed more reductions were necessary, the sources said. Signing on to the privately negotiated agreement were Reps. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., who has represented views of the auto industry, and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif. a strong backer of environmental <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s demand for much tougher auto standards, and <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s resistance, has led to a stalemate that played a large role in blocking a new clean air bill for a decade The Energy and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members who signed on to the agreement have pledged to honor the pact through the entire legislative process, said the sources, who spoke only on condition they not be named. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> is chairman of the full committee, and <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> heads the environment subcommittee that currently is considering amendments to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clean air bill. The agreement will be written as an amendment to the auto pollution section of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s legislation, a section recently amended in subcommittee to eliminate averaging of pollution emissions and to require on-board canisters to capture gasoline vapors. The agreement would require a study before 2003 by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and congressional <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION>, to determine if more emissions reductions would be needed. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator could decide to tighten the standards as a result of the study or leave them alone. If he does nothing, standards already proposed by <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> would automatically become effective. The agreement also would include controls on toxic chemicals coming from automobiles, the sources said. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> now requires nitrogen oxide emissions be limited to 0.4 grams per mile up to 50,000 miles. Beginning 1995, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s hydrocarbon limits _ to be written into federal law _ will be 0.25 grams per mile for 50,000 miles and 0.31 grams between 50,000 and 100,000 miles The carbon monoxide standard is 3.4 grams for 50,000 miles and 4.2 grams between 50,000 and 100,000 miles. Current federal standards outside <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> are 0.41 grams per mile for hydrocarbons, 1 gram for nitrogen oxides and 3.4 grams for carbon monoxide. `` With <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> agreeing, I do n't see who can keep it out of the law,'' one source said of the new standards. Chief Senate clean air sponsors already have proposed tough emissions requirements, but the amendment process has not yet started in that chamber.

<HEAD>Court To Decide on Lawyer's Fees in California Civil Rights Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether lawyers who win civil rights cases can collect a big chunk of their clients' awards under an agreement made when the attorneys were hired. The court said it will hear an appeal by a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> man awarded $ 2.12 million and then ordered to pay 40 percent of the judgment to his lawyer. The case stems from a federal lawsuit by <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Venegas </PERSON> against <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> police officers. <PERSON> Venegas </PERSON> was imprisoned for 2 -LCB- years for a murder conviction obtained with perjured evidence, according to court records. <PERSON> Venegas </PERSON> hired <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> to represent him in the suit and agreed to a pay the lawyer 40 percent of any award he won. A federal court also awarded <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> $ 75,000 in legal fees, an amount to be paid by the police officers. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Venegas </PERSON> parted ways in 1986 when the lawyer asked for another 10 percent of the judgment to represent him on appeal and <PERSON> Venegas </PERSON> refused. The lawyer then filed a court motion to place a lien on the judgment to recover his 40 percent contingent fee, or $ 406,000. A federal judge gave <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> a partial victory, ruling he may be entitled to the contingent fee but leaving the matter to a state court to decide. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> won a bigger victory before the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The appeals court last April sent the case back to the federal judge to reconsider the lawyer's bid to enforce a lien on the $ 2.12 million award. The appeals court also said that under federal civil rights law, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> is not limited to court-awarded attorneys' fees when a contingency fee agreement exists with a client. Federal law `` does not place a ceiling on an attorney's entitlement under a contingency fee agreement,'' the appeals court said `` Fairness requires that we respect the freedom of clients and attorneys to agree to a contingency fee in excess'' of any court award. <PERSON> Venegas </PERSON> also argued that <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> misled him when they made the contingency fee agreement. <PERSON> Venegas </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> did not tell him about the benefits the lawyer was entitled to receive under federal civil rights law. The case is <PERSON> Venegas </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 88-1725.

<HEAD>Soil Erosion Threatens Farmland's Productivity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New technology is expected to boost crop yields sharply over the next few decades, but an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> study says soil erosion continues as a threat to the productivity of farmland over the long haul. In its projections announced on Sept. 21, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said only around 220 million acres of cropland may be required by 2030 to meet <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domestic and export needs, compared with more than 380 million acres used in 1982, the base year for the study. The report is the second appraisal of the nation's soil and water resources since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ordered the periodic studies in the Resource Conservation Act of 1977. Regardless of technological advances and higher annual crop yields, the 280-page report also says erosion from water runoff and wind are long-term threats to the land's productivity. And it is difficult to measure. Erosion reduces yields when it is severe, sometimes by up to 50 percent. `` Generally, however, only a very small amount of soil is moved in any given year,'' the report said. `` The resulting annual loss in productivity is so small that it is hidden by differences in the weather or in the management farmers apply from year to year.'' In many soils, it said, crop yields may not appear to decrease at all, even if erosion is excessive, because the farmer has switched to improved, higher-yielding varieties of crops, or is applying more fertilizer, or controlling pests more effectively. To help show what is involved in long-term soil erosion, researchers devised computer models to simulate `` the effects of many years of erosion on many kinds of soil'' under various conditions and systems. Using 1982 management conditions and not allowing for technology improvements, the computer program looked at what might happen to the nation's 421 million acres of cropland after 100 years of `` sheet and rill'' erosion from water runoff, and wind erosion. Overall, according to the computer, cropland productivity would be reduced by less than 3 percent a century from now. `` The projected national percentage of loss is low because many soils are not losing any productivity under current -LRB- farm -RRB- management,'' the report said. In other words, some of the nation's soil is being naturally replaced as rapidly as it is being eroded. But other soils erode at several times the `` tolerance'' value, or replacement rate. And on very fragile soils, even slight erosion results in significant yield reductions, the report said. On some of these, after a century, productivity loss was projected to be quite high. `` Loss of productivity after 100 years is projected to be as high as 60 percent along the central <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Range </ORGANIZATION>, and as high as 50 percent in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>,'' the report said. Another point to keep in mind is that `` a century is a short time in the existence of a soil _ or a society,'' the report said. `` Some soils in the eastern part of the nation have been cultivated for as much as 300 years.'' Even a 100-year period `` can be misleading as an indicator of the long-term effects of erosion,'' it said. According to the computer study, after 100 years it would take more than 6 million `` equivalent'' acres to replace the productivity lost as a result of erosion. That is not the same as the amount of land damaged by water and wind. `` Rather, equivalent acres are the number of additional acres that would be needed, after 100 years of erosion, to match current production levels, assuming constant technology,'' the report said. `` The greatest number of equivalent acres would be needed in the <LOCATION> Corn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt </LOCATION>, where millions of acres used for growing feed grains are projected to sustain moderate losses in productivity.'' <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> would require 617,000 equivalent acres after 100 years to replace its productivity lost from water erosion. Others in the top 10 states in terms of projected losses include: <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, 569,000 acres; <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> 413,000; <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, 389,000; <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, 358,000; <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, 333,000; <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 310,000; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 261,000; <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, 246,000; and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, 235,000. Much of the wind erosion would be concentrated in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> states. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was projected at 380,000 acres after 100 years; <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, 128,000; <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, 108,000; <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 76,000; <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, 66,000; <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, 50,000; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, 43,000; <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, 31,000; <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, 19,000; and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, 19,000.

 More than 1,000 people demonstrated Monday outside a jail to demand the release of a Taiwanese dissident who was arrested as he sneaked back into the country after 10 years of exile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Inside the jail, which was heavily guarded by barricades and hundreds of riot police, <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yao-neng </PERSON> questioned the dissident, publisher <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsin-liang </PERSON>, about sedition charges filed against him in connection with riots 10 years ago. The demonstrators, mostly members of the oppositon <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, waved banners and shouted `` Hsu Hsin-liang not guilty!'' They demanded he be released on bail. Several protesters set off firecrackers to celebrate <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON>'s return. The four-hour protest ended without incident. Prosecutors have rejected a request by <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Shui-pien </PERSON>, that <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> be freed on bond. <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON>, 48, was arrested Wednesday after coast guard officials found him hiding in a fishing boat off the southern Taiwanese port of <LOCATION> Kaohsiung </LOCATION> as he was attempting to sneak back into the country. He had tried three other times since 1979 to return to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> but was turned back when airliners observed a <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> government demand he not be allowed to board Taiwan-bound flights.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for $ 400 million in housing loan guarantees for about 100,000 Soviet Jews expected in the country now that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has tightened its visa rules, officials said today. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said today it would study the request. The request was made by Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who returned Friday from a trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, ministry spokesman <PERSON> Arieh </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenblatt </PERSON> said. It will cost an estimated $ 3 billion to educate, house and employ the immigrants, <PERSON> Greenblatt </PERSON> said. He said that about one-third of that total would be sought from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including $ 600 million in donations from American Jews and $ 400 million through U.S.-guaranteed loans. The guarantees would allow <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to borrow money from commercial banks at low interest. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law limits loan guarantees to $ 25 million per country per year. <PERSON> Simcha </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinitz </PERSON>, chairman of the quasi-government <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which helps resettle refugees, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> today that about 100,000 Soviet immigrants were expected over the next three to five years. Questions have been raised about whether <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> plans to settle some of the immigrants in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> might interfere with <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that, while <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s request for $ 400 million in loan guarantees was being studied, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would reject any effort to help resettle immigrants in occupied territories. `` Our policy is we do n't allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to be use for resettlement in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The spokesman said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> discussed the situation in general terms with <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> last week when the president was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` The president emphasized his sympth; ay for that problem and committed to look into it. But we have n't discussed any specifics,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We do anticipate growing numbers of Jewish immigrants wanting to settle in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. There may be costs associated with that,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. But he added that, while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would do would it could to help, there was no way it was going to provide money to help <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> settle immigrants in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has occupied the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> _ home to one million Palestinians and 70,000 Jewish settlers _ since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Israeli Housing Minister <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> recommended in June that new immigrants be put in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlements. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has repeatedly called on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to stop settlement activity there, a major issue in the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. At least 575 Palestinians and 40 Israelis have died in the 21-month-old Arab uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> against Israeli rule. Effective Sunday, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> changed its visa rules to stem the flood of Soviet immigrants. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the embassy in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> faces a backlog of 32,000 applicants. Of the 10,000 new applications in August, 45 percent were Jews. In addition, thousands of Soviet Jews who accepted Israeli visas are waiting at other European sites in hopes of getting visas to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has long pressed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to encourage Soviet Jews to emigrate to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> instead of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Moscow-based Jewish activists say that many Soviet Jews seeking to emigrate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may remain in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> rather than leave for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The American Jewish Committee estimates that more than 170,000 Soviet Jews immigrated to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> between 1965 and 1988. The Soviet Jewish Education and <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> says that of the 18,961 Jews who emigrated from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last year, 2,173 came to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Construction spending posted its biggest advance this year in August, the government said Monday, but the gain was in government and non-residential building while the single-family housing industry continued to sag. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said overall spending increased 1.8 percent last month, up $ 7.3 billion to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 421.8 billion, the first gain since May's 1.4 percent advance. Analysts expect building construction to remain at the current level for the remainder of the year as the economy continues to grow at a modest pace. `` All signals point to not too much change from recent trends,'' economist <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Obrinsky </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said. `` I do n't think we're going to see a boom or a bust in either residential or non-residential construction.'' Analysts have been looking for a slight pickup in construction spending ever since interest rates began falling earlier in the year. Fixed-rate mortgage rates declined from a peak of 11.22 percent in March to 10.22 at the end of August and to 10.16 last week, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the August advance was the biggest since a 2.3 percent increase last December and followed declines of 0.6 percent in July and 0.8 percent in June. The July figure had been revised downward from a miniscule 0.02 percent gain. Government building, a volatile sector representing about 20 percent of construction spending, was up 5.3 percent in August, led by a 4.2 percent rebound in highway building which had fallen 4.5 percent in July. `` That's a number which from time to time shows a big one-month increase and quite often will come back to the previous trend-level in the following months and I suspect we'll see that this time,'' <PERSON> Obrinsky </PERSON> said. Residential construction, which accounts for nearly half of construction spending, posted a tiny fractional increase of 0.05 percent to an annual rate of $ 198.9 billion. But single-family construction fell 0.2 percent to an annual rate of $ 113.1 billion while apartment building gained 0.4 percent to $ 23.5 billion. <PERSON> Obrinsky </PERSON> said he expects the pace of housing starts to improve in the fourth quarter, but at a modest pace. Non-residential construction was up 2.9 percent to an annual rate of $ 100.3 billion, led by advances of 4.5 percent in office buildings and 1.8 percent in factories. Total construction was up 3.4 percent from the level of building a year ago.

<HEAD>Kaifu Promises Political Reform, Review of Sales Tax</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> pledged Monday to press ahead with political reform and a review of a widely unpopular new sales tax in his first policy speech since taking office in August. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> addressed <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s victory in a weekend election indicated the scandal-ridden party's fortunes are `` The restoration of trust in politics is this Cabinet's most important task,'' he said. `` I am thus determined to continue to make a good-faith effort to move ahead on political reform.'' On Sunday, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s party won a by-election to fill a vacancy in Parliament's upper house after the death of a <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker. As the first national-level election under the <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> administration, it was closely watched. The opposition campaigned mainly on pledges to work for abolition of the 3 percent sales tax, which took effect in April and contributed to the Liberal Democrats' loss of its upper house majority for the first time in 34 years in July elections. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said his party is reviewing the sales tax, which it rammed through Parliament late last year, but he ruled out abolishing the levy. `` The consumption tax is absolutely indispensable in light of the need to equalize the tax burden and to meet <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s future needs,'' he said. its weekday schedule from 74 flights a day to 48, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Priddy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer. Air Midwest, which operates as <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> at the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> airport, said it would eliminate service between <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and seven <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> cities: <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, Neb.; <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Moline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dynan </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> operations, said most of the passengers on the canceled routes connected with <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> flights, meaning there now was n't enough traffic to keep flying to those cities <PERSON> Priddy </PERSON> said the reduced <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> schedule, which still would serve 19 cities, could be maintained without feeding <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> flights. He said the cuts would force some layoffs of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION>'s 150 employees at <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, although he did not know how many. `` It's an awfully sad thing, but I really do n't have that much choice at this point,'' <PERSON> Priddy </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>, which is trying to reorganize as a smaller carrier, said it would offer a total of 46 flights nationwide Monday serving 11 cities, and 40 of those flights would start or end at <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The schedule is for two round-trip flights each to 10 cities from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>: <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-LaGuardia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; and Washington-National. Another three round-trip flights will run between <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> is based, and other cities. The schedule will use 12 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727-200s, each of which can carry 169 passengers. None of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s five new Airbus A320 jets will be used. A federal bankruptcy judge ruled last week that an Irish financial service company could suspend its contract to supply <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> with additional A320s. On Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> operated only four departures from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Because traffic was so low in Terminal A, several lounges and snack bars were closed.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> lived an uneventful life on <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s beaches until he and another homeless man were photographed sleeping in front of <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> contestants in swimsuits. The discovery three weeks ago of the men beneath an overturned lifeguard boat interrupted a beach photo session for the beauty queens. Police quickly herded <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and his companion from the beach. Today, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 42, has a job, a roof over his head and money in his pockets. His luck changed last week when he started a new job in the mailroom at <LOCATION> Penguin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, a publishing company in <LOCATION> Bergenfield </LOCATION>. `` It's nice to work for a change,'' he said over a glass of iced tea at a luncheonette near his job. `` I'm not making a lot of money, but it's fine.'' His homelessness started in early summer after he lost a job as a security guard. Before that, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was a taxi driver for seven years in the seaside resort. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> had hit a low point by the time an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer recorded the Sept. 9 episode just off the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> boardwalk before the startled contestants. The photograph appeared in newspapers nationwide, and it was n't the kind of publicity <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> welcomed. `` I did n't want my friends to see it,'' he said. A day after the incident, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s colleague, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, was found dead on the beach. `` I was with him,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` I left him for 20 minutes to bum a cigarette on the Boardwalk.'' Police are investigating the death. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> died of `` something like a heart attack or a brain seizure.'' `` It was n't from being drunk,'' he said. `` Living that kind of life will kill you.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s death inspired him to try to turn around his own life. `` It made me a stronger person. It gave me something to do for a cause,'' he said. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> blames his problems on drugs. He said he used cocaine for about a year, during which he spent as much as $ 3,000 a week, much of it from a $ 70,000 inheritance. He said he quit in February 1985 and went through several rehabilitation programs. But a depression that followed his rehabilitation led to a suicide attempt in 1987, and <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was sent to <LOCATION> Ancora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Psychiatric </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Winslow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> for 10 months, he said. He was released to an <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> halfway house in May 1988, and moved out after getting a job as a security guard. He described the time he spent on the beach as `` a little camping excursion.'' `` I'm glad I went through it in a way,'' he said. `` We had some good times. Hey, look at my tan,'' he said, rolling up a shirt sleeve. A week after the beach episode, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> moved in with a cousin, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, and her husband, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` We gave him the one shot,'' said <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> transit police officer. `` When he called us, I took that as an indication that he wanted help. Eventually, we hope he'll be all right.'' Now that he's working again, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said he would like to help the homeless. He also is considering writing a book. `` There are bums that want to be bums,'' he said. `` You ca n't help them people until they want to be helped But there's a lot of people that want help.''

 Hundreds of East Germans poured into the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> Embassy today, hoping to join 7,000 others who fled West during the weekend. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> demanded that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> expel the new arrivals. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> filed an official protest with West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON>, demanding that <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> throw out those who have arrived since the dramatic exodus during the weekend. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the nation's permanent representative in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Neubauer </PERSON>, complained to <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was reneging on an agreement by harboring the newcomers West German government urged <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to allow the second wave of East German refugees to also emigrate to the West. West German officials have said there were no strings attached to the earlier transfer. <PERSON> Neubauer </PERSON>, according to <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION>, told <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> that it was <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s decision to let the earlier group of refugees leave on humanitarian grounds because the embassy compounds had become unhealthy due to overcrowding. <PERSON> Neubauer </PERSON> accused West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> of falsely taking credit for the resolution of the refugee standoff. Despite roadblocks in the area and strict identity checks, between 500 and 600 East Germans have made their way inside the compound here, refugees reported. About 100 new refugees were at the embassy in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. Czech police patrolled the area with dogs during the night, and some refugees said police had resorted to violence to stem the flow of East Germans. One woman said police had dragged and kicked her family. A diplomat from the mission hurried out to rescue one man who clung to the embassy fence as policemen tried to drag him away. The diplomat put his arm around the East German, and police allowed him to lead the man inside. Police then freed another refugee, who had been handcuffed to a park bench nearby. East German agreed to the refugee transfer on Saturday and thousands of East Germans from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> departed on Sunday. As they left, however, hundreds of other East Germans trying to get West convered on the embassies, hoping they too would be granted safe passage to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had harsh words for those who emigrated West during the weekend. `` With their behavior they have trampled on moral values and excluded themselves from our society. No one should cry any tears for them,'' said a government statement issued late Sunday by the state <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We are pleased that these refugees are being allowed access to the West. ... It looks like the officials there are taking a responsible approach in trying to help these people get to the West.'' In mid-September, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders registered fierce protests when <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s liberal leaders opened their border to the West and thousands of East Germans fled. The exodus through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> continued overnight. Border authorities in <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> reported 1,051 new arrivals by early today. In all, about 2,000 refugees fled through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> during the weekend, officials said. West German government spokesmen disclosed that Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> played an important role in winning the refugees' release from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> during the weekend, and said Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been in touch with <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> by telephone throughout the continuing refugee saga. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is expected in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to help commemorate 40 years of Communist rule in a country that has already lost more than 100,000 people to the westward exodus this year. The Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Comunist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda today devoted almost all of its fifth page to feting the East German anniversary and said not a word about the refugee exodus. About 7,000 East German refugees, many weeping with joy, pulled into West German train stations early Sunday after <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> agreed to let them emigrate. Some said they jumped aboard the freedom trains as they passed through <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which agreed to the exodus on condition the refugees travel via their homeland. That allowed <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to say the refugees were being `` expelled.'' The latest arrivals in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> follow more than 26,000 East Germans who have fled through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> since Sept. 10, when <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> broke ranks with the rest of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc and opened its border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. The extraordinary accord permitting the latest refugees to go to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> followed discussions involving East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. It underscored dramatic changes in the Soviet bloc and growing divisions among its member states. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, under 77-year-old leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, has been an outspoken opponent of the reforms advocated by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Many of those arriving Sunday aboard packed trains in the northern Bavarian city of <LOCATION> Hof </LOCATION> had tears streaming down their faces. Others cheered and clapped wildly. `` We had no future there,'' 34-year-old <PERSON> Uwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuester </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cottbus </LOCATION> said of his Communist homeland. Well-wishers handed out bottles of wine, champagne and fruit as the newcomers disembarked. West German law automatically grants East Germans citizenship on arrival.

 A blind, aspiring minister who for nine years has sought financial aid from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state so he can attend <PERSON> Bible </PERSON> college lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal today. The court, without comment, let stand the state's refusal to subsidize vocational training for <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Witters </PERSON>. He argued that the refusal violates his religious freedom. The justices in 1986 ruled unanimously that the state's providing <PERSON> Witters </PERSON> with financial aid would not violate the constitutionally required separation of church and state The 1986 decision overturned a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that had said giving <PERSON> Witters </PERSON> money under a state vocational-training program for the blind would promote religion impermissibly. <PERSON> Witters </PERSON>' case then returned to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which last April 20 ruled, by a 5-4 vote, that letting <PERSON> Witters </PERSON> receive the state funding would violate a state constitution ban. A provision of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s constitution says, `` No public money ... shall be appropriated for or applied to any religious ... instruction.'' In the appeal acted on today, <PERSON> Witters </PERSON> argued that the state constitution's provision violates his religious freedom protected by the federal Constitution's First Amendment. His case crystalizes the inherent tension between two First Amendment clauses _ one banning official `` establishment'' of religion and one banning official interference with `` the free exercise'' of religion. <PERSON> Witters </PERSON>, who is legally blind, was first denied aid in 1980. As a result, he was forced to drop out of the Inland Empire School of the Bible in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> and take a dish-washing job in a medical laboratory. His appeal said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had excluded <PERSON> Witters </PERSON> `` from receiving the benefits of public welfare legislation because of his faith.'' The appeal likened the state's treatment of <PERSON> Witters </PERSON> to an attempt by <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> to ban religious clubs from meeting on state college campuses and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s attempt to bar ministers from holding elective office. The nation's highest court struck down both of those state attempts as unconstitutional infringements of religious rights. In urging the justices to reject <PERSON> Witters </PERSON>' appeal, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON> argued, `` The problem with what -LRB- <PERSON> Witters </PERSON> -RRB- wants arises from the type of instruction which he wishes the state to fund, not from his career goal or from the institution he wishes to attend.'' <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON> said <PERSON> Witters </PERSON> would be eligible for state funding if he took non-religious courses, even at the Bible school. The case is <PERSON> Witters </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> for the Blind, 89-94.

 President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> called on fractious Afghan rebel groups Monday to unite to form an Islamic government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and to reject <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, also quoted <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as calling for an end to superpower intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, where U.S.-backed Moslem rebels have been fighting 11 years to oust the Soviet-backed government. Opening an international seminar on the Afghan issue, the president urged all Afghan groups to cooperate in their fight for self-determination and `` to isolate ideologies alien to Afghan culture and tradition.''

That was an apparent reference to the split in guerrilla ranks.

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled unanimously today that the state's public school finance system is unconstitutional and gave lawmakers until May to come up with a solution. The nine-member court, however, said it would not instruct the legislature what specific steps to take to correct the problem. A state district judge had held the school finance system unconstitutional in a case brought by poor school districts, many of them largely Hispanic, against the state education commissioner and others. That ruling was overturned last December by a 2-1 vote of the Austin-based <ORGANIZATION> 3rd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, but the high court upheld the plaintiffs today on the grounds that the constitution required an `` efficient'' education system. `` We hold that the state's school financing system is neither financially efficient, nor efficient in the sense of providing for a ` general diffusion of knowledge' statewide,'' Justice <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauzy </PERSON>'s opinion said. With an enrollment of 3.3 million, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has the second-largest public school system in the country after <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> school districts with relatively low property values brought the suit in 1984. As in most states, public schools in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> are funded largely through a combination of local property taxes and state aid. Similar financing systems have been challenged in court in at least 10 other states. The case is known as <LOCATION> Edgewood </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>, from the lead plaintiff, <ORGANIZATION> Edgewood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, and lead defendant, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm still, I think, about 20,000 feet over <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Edgewood </LOCATION> Superintendent <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> said after learning of the ruling. `` It's the end of a five-year struggle for me, personally, but it's the end of a 20-year struggle for the school district,'' he said. <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> was out of town to give a speech and could not immediately be reached for comment. In its ruling, the court rejected arguments that reform in school finance will eliminate local control, saying an efficient system does not mean an end to local control, `` only that the funds available for education be distributed equitably and evenly.'' <PERSON> Mauzy </PERSON>'s opinion said because the court had decided that the finance system violated the constitution's efficiency requirement, it need not consider petitioners' other constitutional challenges such as the argument that the present system is discriminatory. <PERSON> Mauzy </PERSON>'s opinion said the court would give the legislature until May 1, 1990, to come up with a remedy, because the court wanted to avoid `` any sudden disruption in the educational processes.'' `` Let there be no misunderstanding,'' the opinion said. `` A remedy is long overdue. The legislature must take immediate action.'' The legislature meets in special session Nov. 14. There was no immediate response from Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> on whether he would put school financing on the agenda in the wake of the court's decision. In the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s regular session this spring, lawmakers approved five education bills, including a plan to pump $ 450 million in extra state aid to help equalize funding and provide a pay raise for teachers. But many of the poor districts complained the extra money was not nearly enough and many cities have been forced to raise property taxes to pay for state-mandated education reforms. In 1988, Comptroller <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON> found that 730 of the state's 1,100 school districts spend less than the statewide average of $ 3,290 per student per year The average in those districts was $ 2,976. In the wealthier districts, the average yearly expenditure was $ 4,268. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, state director of the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION>, the Hispanic civil rights organization, called the decision long overdue and `` a very bold step for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is one of 11 states whose school financing systems have been challenged in court on the grounds of equity. In June, for example, the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ordered that state's <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to reorganize the state's public education programs Other states with active lawsuits or court orders concerning school finance are <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. A coalition of poor <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> districts says it will probably sue that state this fall.

<TEXT>
 Thirty-one people died in the bloodiest 24-hour period since the government declared a unilateral cease-fire last week, military officials reported Monday. Twenty-four people were murdered by Sinhalese radicals, six were killed by soldiers they had ambushed, and a jailed Sinhalese extremist committed suicide, the officials said. A soldier and a child were wounded in the ambush Sunday at <LOCATION> Girikola </LOCATION> village, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, said the officials, whose names can not be used under briefing rules. The deaths brought the total to 59 since the government proclaimed the cease-fire Wednesday. It originally was called for three days, then extended until 6 a.m. Tuesday. President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> instructed the military to halt operations against members of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a Sinhalese radical group, but said they were allowed to defend themselves. He declared the truce to give the radicals among the Sinhalese, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s predominant ethnic group, an opportunity to end their 2-year-old uprising and join peace talks. At least 5,000 people have been killed in the violence. The People's <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> rejected negotiations and continued its campaign of killings and arson, but the government said 869 extremists had surrendered during the cease-fire. Military officials said the 24 people killed by Sinhalese radicals included two soldiers whose vehicle was blown up. They said the other victims were police informants, members of policemen's families or supporters of the government. At least 14 post offices, 17 government buildings and three buses were burned, the officials reported. Violence increased after <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> took office in January, after elections the extremists claimed were fraudulent. They oppose the 1987 peace accord with ethnic Tamil separatists and the presence of Indian soldiers assigned to supervise the peace plan. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has said it will withdraw its troops by Dec. 31. About 11,000 people have been killed in the Tamil war, which began in 1983.

<HEAD>Labor Abandons Nuclear Disarmament</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a major policy reversal, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> dropped its once-cherished policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament. At its annual conference, the socialist movement voted to adopt a new platform that would commit a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> government to scrapping <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s nuclear weapons only in a negotiated arms deal. Ditching the non-nuclear doctrine, which had been a factor in Labor's successive defeats by Conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> since losing power in 1979, is part of a major policy overhaul. Anti-nuclear activists had accused the party of betraying its principles. `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> does not need nuclear weapons; there is no <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear threat,'' declared <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Benn </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister and veteran left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> legislator, during a sometimes impassioned debate. The delegates voted by 3.6 million to 2.4 million for the new policy, after moderate trade union leaders swung the huge votes of their entire memberships behind party leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>. Votes are counted in millions at Labor conferences because of the block vote system. Labor leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, his party leading the Conservatives in opinion polls for the past four months, had secured support from most of the trade union leaders who control 90 percent of the voting power at the party's conferences. Polls published Sunday showed Labor between five and 12 percentage points ahead of the Conservatives. Under the new policy, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> would retain <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s submarine-launched <ORGANIZATION> Polaris </ORGANIZATION> nuclear missiles and also drop its previous pledge to shut down <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear bases The policy also calls for a Labor-led government to stick with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s decision to replace <ORGANIZATION> Polaris </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1990s with the far more powerful <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trident missile system. Party moderates have long said the non-nuclear policy, adopted in 1981, invited electoral defeat. But 47-year-old <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, a committed unilateralist since his student days, held out until after Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> won a third successive five-year term in 1987. Party leaders now argue that the strides in superpower arms control negotiations mean Labor is dropping a redundant policy rather than betraying a cherished ideal.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said today after a meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that a `` golden opportunity'' exists for an eventual settlement of the conflict between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION>. After meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for almost an hour, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> told reporters the essential next step in the peace process is to convince the Israelis and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to enter into a dialogue without preconditions. Asserting that he believes a comprehensive settlement is possible eventually, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said, `` It would be a grave mistake to miss the golden opportunity existing today. A continuation of the status quo is hazardous to both parties.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> against a background of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to persuade a reluctant <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to open discussions with Palestinians based on proposals set forth by the Egyptian leader. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials regard the 10-point Egyptian plan as a complement to the proposal by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> for elections in which Palestinians would select representatives to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on limited self-government in the occupied territories. After the Oval Office meeting, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> was off to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for lunch with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> addressed the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Friday and arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sunday. His visit is officially listed as private. Shortly before leaving for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> reaffirmed to reporters his backing for <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s initiative, calling it a way to get an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue that would, in turn, pave the way for Palestinian elections. `` We wo n't get to peace until Palestinians and Israelis speak to each other,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. As photographers snapped pictures at the outset of the meeting, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asking the Egyptian leader, `` Did you get any squash in?'' `` I did n't find time to. I did n't find any place,'' replied <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, an avid squash player. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> today declined comment on an Egyptian newspaper report that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had proposed a joint Egyptian-Israeli committee to pave the way for elections in the territories. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said it would be `` inappropriate to comment'' on the <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Akhbar </ORGANIZATION> report. `` We have discussed any number of ways to facilitate that kind of discussion, but there have been no specific proposals,'' he said. A key element of <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s proposal is the convening of talks between Israelis and Palestinians in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said last week he is worried that the Palestinians may be more interested in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s surrender than in a peaceful settlement. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also objects to <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s suggestion that voting rights be extended to Arabs living in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and to Palestinians who live outside the occupied territories. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has rejected <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s suggestion that the outcome of any negotiations be self-determination for the Palestinians. The <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict was a dominant issue for <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> during his talks last week at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> holds the view that <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s plan and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election proposal are not mutually exclusive and that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> therefore should not use his objections as a basis for scuttling the peace process. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s proposal stops short of demanding the establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, and it contains other features which have attracted favorable comment from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The plan has caused a deep split between Labor and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, threatening the governing coalition between the two that has existed for 10 months On Sunday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot and killed four Palestinians in clashes in the occupied lands and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> activists stabbed to death a man they accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the army and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospitals said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Moslem fundamentalists issued a new leaflet calling on Palestinians to escalate their 21-month-old uprising and to `` continue to kill collaborators.''

 <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, former Hungarian beauty queen and convicted cop-slapper, said today the court should turn the other cheek and spare her jail time because it would be `` silly'' to punish her like that when she did nothing wrong. The unrepentant Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> said, however, that she is prepared to turn in her glamorous garb for prison drab, according to an interview from her <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> home with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' `` Nothing in the world can scare me, I tell you, my darling,'' said the sometime actress in her trademark Hungarian accent. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, who appeared in such films as `` Moulin Rouge'' and `` Picture Mommy Dead'' was convicted Friday of slapping a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> police officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> during a traffic stop, of driving without a valid driver's license and of having an open container of alcohol in her car. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> was acquitted of disobeying <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> by driving away as he checked her motor vehicle record on June 14. She faces up to 18 months, five days in jail and a $ 3,500 fine at her Oct. 17 sentencing. `` What did I do that was so wrong?'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> said today, repeating the points she raised at her trial. `` I protected myself from a 6-foot-4 man who called me every name in the world and who treated me like ... a streetwalker. I should go for that to jail? I think that would be really _ that would be silly.''

<DATELINE>EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Teachers in this financially strapped city went out on strike today after rejecting a salary offer that would have left many `` taking home less pay than last year,'' a union official said. Union members were setting up pickets at all 36 schools in the district, said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Turley </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> Local 1220. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, principal at <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said classes were canceled for the district's 16,000 students. Most of the staff members at his school were picketing, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said, and members of other unions, such as the custodians, were honoring the picket lines. The <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> had proposed binding arbitration to settle disputes over wage increases and insurance payments. The district, which has a $ 12.5 million debt, is trying to get the teachers to pay a larger share of health insurance costs. <PERSON> Turley </PERSON> said union members met Sunday and voted 347-227 to reject binding arbitration, effectively voting to strike in the fourth-largest school district in the state. The 1,200 teachers, teachers' aides, clerks and attendance officers represented by the union had been working without a contract since school started Aug. 28, <PERSON> Turley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Turley </PERSON> declined to disclose the terms of the board's final offer, but said rising insurance costs would have offset pay increases for some teachers. Last year, the teachers were under a wage freeze. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superintendent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Leininger </PERSON> said the district stands to lose $ 60 million in state funds for failing to implement an emergency debt-reduction plan. The plan called for firing 250 teachers, shifting the cost of dependent health care coverage to employees and closing or consolidating four schools to save $ 11 million by the end of this year.

<HEAD>Court Asks Administration for Views on Gas Consumers Suits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today asked the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for its views on broadening the power of states to sue in behalf of gas consumers allegedly overcharged by utility companies. The court said it wants to hear from <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers before acting on an appeal by <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> officials who have accused utilities of illegal price-fixing. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s response may take months. The appeal was supported by 32 other states seeking to protect their consumers and vigorously enforce antitrust laws. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> officials sued the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Utilicorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> over natural gas transported by pipeline from <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and used to generate electricity sold to customers in the two states. Some of the natural gas delivered from <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> was sold to the utilities' customers. The states alleged that gas-producing companies conspired to inflate the price of the gas, and that the utilities passed on the higher rates to consumers. The 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in January that the states do not have the authority to sue in behalf of residential customers. The appeals court said that only direct purchasers of fixed amounts of gas may sue in such cases. `` Any allocation of illegal overcharges to the residential consumers may require tracing the sale from the wellhead through each level of distribution to establish the amount of illegal gas costs actually paid ... adding new dimensions of complexity to antitrust suits,'' the appeals court said. `` Residential indirect purchasers of natural gas are not entitled to sue the alleged violators,'' the appeals court said. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> officials said the ruling conflicts with that of the 7th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which permitted such suits. The states urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to resolve the conflict. The 10th Circuit court has jurisdiction over lawsuits in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. The states that supported the Kansas-Missouri appeal are <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Court To Decide Bar Association Dues Issue in California Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether attorneys may withhold their state bar association dues if the association uses the money to campaign for various causes and issues. The justices said they will hear arguments by 21 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lawyers who say their free-speech rights are being violated because they are forced to pay dues to the bar group in order to continue practicing law in the state. The attorneys said the money is being used to promote numerous ideological causes, including a nuclear weapons freeze and handgun control, that they do not support. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in February that the lawyers' rights were not violated, except if money is used by the bar association to help finance campaigns of candidates for public office `` We conclude that the state bar may use dues to finance any activity, except election campaigning, which is germane to its statutory mission to promote the improvement of the administration of justice,'' the state court said. The ruling conflicts with decisions by other state courts that limit the power of state bar associations to use members' dues for ideological purposes. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> court said the bar association, with power to license and discipline lawyers, is more like a state agency than a labor union. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has limited the power of unions to spend dues money for public-issue lobbying. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> court noted that every lawyer in the state must be a member of the bar to practice law there. Also, the state court said, the bar association is run by a governing board that includes six of 22 members appointed by the governor with approval of the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Constitution, statutes and judicial decisions ... appear to envision the bar as a governmental agency,'' the state court said. Therefore, the state court continued, the bar association may use its revenues `` for any purposes within its authority.'' Issues of public health, safety and welfare fall within that category, the state court said. But the state court said the bar association went too far in 1982 when it distributed material supporting justices of the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> who were up for re-election. The material permissibly supported the independence of the judiciary, the state court said. But `` its primary purpose, we believe, was to assist in the election campaign on behalf of the justices.'' That exceeded the association's authority, the state court added. The case is <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> vs. State Bar of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, 88-1905.

 After 40 years of living together, <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eigil </PERSON> <PERSON> Axgil </PERSON> spent a happy first day as a `` married couple'' Monday. <PERSON> Axel </PERSON>, 74, and <PERSON> Eigil </PERSON>, 67, were among the first 11 male couples to exchange vows Sunday as <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> became the first country to give homosexual couples legal status and the right to join in a `` registered partnership.'' Hundreds of homosexuals applauded, waved flags and threw rice on them on the Town Hall steps, while <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> fundamentalists demonstrated on the other side of the square. One demonstrator waving a Bible called it `` Sodom's Day.'' `` Homosexuality is a sin,'' he said. Parliament in May approved a gay rights bill by a lopsided majority. Only the small <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> party opposed the measure. The law, which took effect Sunday, gives homosexual couples nearly equal rights as heterosexual couples but bars them from adopting children. They have the same inheritance rights, tax advantages and the right to share a last name. Under the new law, at least one partner must have Danish citizenship and live in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>. Like the other 10 couples, <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eigil </PERSON> solemnly answered `` yes'' to deputy mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahlberg </PERSON> when he asked if they consented to tie each other in `` a registered partnership.'' They combined their first names to form a common last name. `` We decided to get officially ` married' because we have the same feelings for each other as heterosexual couples,'' said <PERSON> Axel </PERSON>, speaking on Danish television. He and <PERSON> Eigil </PERSON> later left town for several days, friends said, apparently on a honeymoon. No lesbian couples have been registered. `` We do n't like to be in the front line,'' one woman said after Sunday's ceremony. `` The next step will be the acquisition of the right to adopt stepchildren from one of the partners from an earlier heterosexual marriage and the right to be blessed in a church,'' said <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON>, who was among the couples and is a pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Danish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` If I had the right to marry a homosexual couple in my church, I would certainly like to do so, but for the time being we'll have to wait,'' <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> said. `` When it -LRB- the partnership -RRB- becomes official, it lasts longer,'' said <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON>'s partner, school psychologist <PERSON> Ove </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsen </PERSON>, who moved into the church parsonage two years ago.

 The fate of Medicare catastrophic health care coverage for 33 million Americans hangs in the balance as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> considers repealing the program to cool the `` blast furnace heat'' of angry senior citizens. House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> today chided the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for its silence on the program, which could be voted on this week, and added: `` I'm told the president opposes the repeal but I have n't seen any evidence of it.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., supports a continuation of the program and said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s refusal to take a more vocal stand on the issue puts <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in `` an awkward position. Votes also may occur this week in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today, `` Our position basically is that we want to retain the benefits and mitigate the premium costs.'' But the administration has not yet endorsed or rejected any of the major alternatives the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is expected to consider, he added. The program's defenders have launched a last-ditch effort to save it by pushing a revision that would scrap major features of the program, cancel the unpopular surtax that helps finance it, and retain new prescription drug benefits scheduled to begin in January. `` We're on the heart-lung machine trying to keep the program going,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>, legislative director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>. `` But it's obvious that some major changes are going to have to be made.'' The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act is aimed at providing protection for the elderly and disabled against financial ruin in the event of a prolonged hospital stay or other high medical costs. The plan limits the amount that beneficiaries must pay for hospital care, physician services, medical supplies and prescription drugs and expands other health care benefits as well. For example, the program pays for unlimited approved hospitalization after a once-a-year deductible of $ 560 in 1989. Previously, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> charged a deductible for each hospital stay during a year and provided full payment of hospital bills for 59 days a year. The program was enacted with support from major senior citizen groups such as <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> but drew swift and strong criticism from many older Americans who were angry at the costs for mandatory coverage that some said they neither wanted nor needed. Many elderly people said they already had duplicate coverage from private insurers and that the new program does n't address their chief concern with the high cost of long-term care in nursing homes. Higher-income retirees also objected to paying a high proportion of the program's costs. The focal point of the opposition is a surtax levied on the 40 percent of retirees whose incomes are high enough that they pay more than $ 150 in income tax. The surtax _ 15 percent of their income tax liabilities _ this year is capped at $ 800 per Medicare enrollee but rises in future years. `` A lot of people do n't have that extra money in their budgets,'' said <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasek </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> retiree who joined a grassroots group called Seniors Opposed to the Surtax. `` The best thing is to go back to point one and start over again.'' The opposition has members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the run _ literally. Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the 6-foot-4 chairman of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was booed and chased down a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> street by a group of senior citizens last month after he refused to discuss the catastrophic package with them. `` These people do n't understand what the government is trying to do for them,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said as he hurried to outpace his critics. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> earlier this month said the protests had reached `` tidal wave'' proportions but that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration still hopes to see the program preserved. Many proponents of the package maintain that most seniors support the catastrophic package and that it is a vocal and affluent minority making much of the noise. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON>, legislative director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION>, said that while the opposition has hit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with `` blast furnace heat,'' legislators and seniors will come to regret it if they repeal important health care benefits. `` Over time, seniors would look back and say, ` We really could have used that benefit,'' he predicted. House action on the catastrophic package is expected this week as the chamber works through an omnibus budget bill laden with a host of unrelated items. Legislators will have the chance to vote on proposals both to repeal and scale back the program. As an alternative to repeal, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders are pushing a plan that would eliminate the surtax and strip out new hospital, doctor and nursing home benefits. The remaining benefits would be financed by keeping the existing flat fee of $ 4 a month paid by all but the poorest <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries. Left intact would be new prescription drug benefits and modest expansions of coverage for home health care, hospice benefits and in-home respite care. Also kept would be a requirement that Medicaid pay the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> deductibles, premiums and copayments for the poorest seniors. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., is pushing a plan that would scrap the surtax, retain the new hospitalization benefits, kill the drug benefit and remove the cap on doctor payments Other senators are likely to push competing plans to repeal or revise the catastrophic program.

 Entertainer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> used the `` tough love'' approach with his 23-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Erinn </PERSON>, when she told him that she was addicted to drugs and alcohol, both father and daughter say. <PERSON> Erinn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, who checked out of a drug rehabilitation center Sept. 24, said she began using cocaine at age 19, but that her parents had no idea se had a drug habit until she wrote them a letter six months ago. She said she had kicked a $ 200-a-day cocaine habit by then but was still heavily hooked on pot and alcohol. <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, who plays a father-knows-best-style dad on his hit television series and wrote a best-seller `` Fatherhood'' about his experiences with his five children, said he consulted specialists on how to handle the situation and he and his wife wrote back urging her to seek treatment. But they refused to coddle her. `` ` Tough love' is the only way of dealing with this. We love her and want her to get better, but we have to take a very firm, very tough stand that forces her to realize that no one can fix things for her,'' the star told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enquirer </ORGANIZATION>. `` She has to beat this on her own.'' `` People see <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> as a super dad.

<HEAD>Report Calls for Medicare Reform, Research on Medical Services</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Medicare reform, research to determine effective medical procedures and an emphasis on healthy living are needed to avert a health care crisis in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said a congressional staff report released Monday. The report by the Democratic staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also said some form of national health insurance would ensure that everyone gets high quality, affordable health care, solving the problem posed by an estimated 37 million uninsured Americans. But the report said such a system `` may be a long way from becoming a reality'' because of political reasons and resistance by physicians. The report compiles information gathered during nine days of hearings last year by the health subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which advises <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on economic trends but does not initiate legislation. At a news conference where the report was distributed, Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the health subcommittee, and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Califano </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, former secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> and the lead witness in the hearings, said much could be saved by ridding waste from the health care system and directing the savings. `` It's not a situation where you have to spend more money,'' said <PERSON> Califano </PERSON>, who served under former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` Let's wring the waste out of the system and use it. Americans spent more than $ 550 billion annually on health care, but <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON> said, `` this system is falling apart'' as costs for medical care soar. Though the report lists national health insurance as the top recommendation, it said that given the political realities, cost-saving changes in the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> system _ the federal health insurance program for the elderly _ would be more easily achieved in the short run. The key change suggested by the report would reform the rates by which physicians are reimbursed, lowering some and raising others to make the system fairer and less complex. Such a change was proposed in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. The report also says standards of care must be developed based on research on the effectiveness of various tests and procedures. The report said an estimated 20 percent of medical services, costing $ 125 billion a year, may be unnecessary. This effort to reduce unneeded medical services is also being considered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Also, physicians should more actively promote healthier lifestyles through drug, alcohol and nutrition counseling and screen for prevalent diseases so they can be caught in the early stages, the report said.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of would-be emigrants lined up outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy for visa applications Monday as new rules on emigration took effect, but the embassy quickly ran out of new forms and turned away thouands of angry people. Consular officials distributed 30,500 applications at a rate of 100 per minute, with a maximum of five allotted each person, before running out in about 2 -LCB- hours. Another 70,000 application forms were expected to be delivered to the embassy by the end of the week, an official said, and 300,000 more shortly thereafter. `` We hope to be out of the woods by Friday,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Many Soviets were angry at being turned away and are upset at the new regulations, which require applicants to deal with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> rather than the embassy in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The changes were made because the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy was unable to handle the flood of applications. `` It is a conspiracy between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and Soviet authorities,'' said one woman who refused to give her name. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Embassy should be ashamed of the way they are treating us,'' said another Soviet, who also refused to identify himself. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has long urged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to liberalize its emigration policy. But now that Soviet rules have become more lax, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has found it can not accept all the Soviets who wish to emigrate. The new regulations that went into effect Oct. 1 spurred a surge in the number of people lining up at the embassy, and more than 15,000 lined up over the weekend to be among the first to get new forms. They organized themselves into groups of 100, with group leaders holding up signs so people could secure a place in line, then leave and return later. On Monday morning, traffic around the embassy on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s busy Garden Ring Road was snarled, and the sidewalks around the embassy were jammed with people. When the applications ran out, people still were lined up between signs with numbers up to 11,000. According to Soviets at a shack set up to register for a place in line, 17,000 people had signed up over the weekend. A reporter visiting the embassy was besieged by hundreds of people who though he was a consular official. They demanded to know when they would get the applications and whether photocopies would be acceptable in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Several times during the day, embassy officials waded into the crowd that had waited overnight to explain that new forms would be available Wednesday and that photocopies would be acceptable. Hundreds of people have lined up outside the embassy every working day since Soviet officials began liberalizing emigration policies last year, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been swamped with paperwork. Under the new regulations, applications will be sent directly to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> rather than evaluated by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> consular officials. An official said last week that the embassy is likely to receive 300,000 applications in the next year but will be able to accept only about 70,000-80 ,000 Following ceilings set in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will accept 50,000 Soviets classified as refugees and another 20,000-30 ,000 on a so-called parole system that does not guarantee any government support The new system also gives priority to people with close relatives already in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and to those who belong to groups that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> considers to be persecuted in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Scores of small earthquakes shook <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Etna </LOCATION> on Monday, threatening to open a new fissure on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most active volcano, scientists said. The volcano has been erupting since Sept. 11, coughing plumes of ash and lighting the night sky with spectacular fountains of lava down its southeastern flank. Officials say it poses no threat to nearby villages. Since Sunday night, there have been 30 to 35 temblors an hour on the volcano, scientists said. The quakes cracked pavement and forced the closure of a road used to reach sites on the southeastern side of the mountain. Some of the quakes had a magnitude of more than 2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion, said <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazzetta </PERSON>, one of the scientists monitoring the eruption. A quake of magnitude 2 on the scale, which gauges the energy released by an earthquake as measured by a seismograph, is the smallest normally felt by humans. The increase in quakes could open a new lava-spilling fissure on the southern flank of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Etna </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fazzetta </PERSON> said.

Commanders are responsible for `` good order and discipline'' in their commands. In its lengthy study of the blast, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> determined that the explosion in the battleship's No. 2 gun turret `` most likely'' was caused by gunner's mate <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>. But the investigation conducted by Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> also found numerous lax procedures aboard the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, including unauthorized experimentation with extra-strength gunpowder and projectile loads. <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> also found that the officers had failed to qualify enough sailors for their specific duties in the gun turret and that many safety procedures had been circumvented. The admiral's investigation determined, however, that neither the experiments nor the procedural lapses had caused the explosion. Instead, <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> probably sparked the fireball by inserting a type of detonator between two power bags. In his section of the report, <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> also recommended that the captain, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>, and four other high-ranking men aboard the ship be relieved of their duties and that appropriate disciplinary action be taken against them. <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>'s recommendation, however, was softened by his superiors. They recommended that the men receive the non-judicial punishment meted out through the mast procedure. The admiral could, for example, suspend the officers from duty for not more than 30 days in addition to issuing a reprimand. Other possible disciplinary action might include pay cuts or other restrictions.

The increase, effective Dec. 1, would raise from $ 1,468 to $ 1,539 a month the basic benefit payment for a veteran with 100 percent disability resulting from his or her service in the military. Maximum monthly benefits would rise from $ 2,559 to $ 2,684 under the legislation, which was approved without opposition on a voice vote. The increases will raise the annual cost of veterans' disability and survivor beneifts _ now estimated at $ 10.2 billion _ by $ 398 million in fiscal 1990, which began on Sunday, and by $ 525 million in fiscal 1991, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Eurotunnel to Cost 44 Percent More Than Planned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Like many a construction project, the 31-mile rail link being built beneath the English Channel is going to cost a lot more than planned and might not be finished on time. The cost of the project, estimated in 1987 at $ 7.8 billion, has grown 44 percent and now is $ 11.3 billion, builders said Monday. Project contractors blame the cost increase on inflation, construction problems and higher costs for rail cars. The news sent shares of <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Anglo-French </LOCATION> consortium building the link betwen <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, slumping 72 cents to $ 10.47 in trading on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Shares were trading at about $ 16.10 in late July, when <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> first indicated it would need more money. <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> initially arranged $ 8.1 billion in loans and raised $ 1.61 billion by selling stock in the project. Now it needs to raise at least $ 1.61 billion more, said <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> co-chairman <PERSON> Alastair </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>. The consortium said it would seek to raise the extra funds next year or in 1991, 75 percent from its banks and the remainder perhaps by selling additional shares to current shareholders. In addition to denting investor confidence, the announcement fueled fears that the builders might be unable to complete the tunnel without government aid and that the higher costs would lead to higher fares. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> supports the project but has maintained that no public funds would go toward it. Added to the financial problems are concerns about when the link will be completed. Technical advisers to the banks funding the project say it might be 5 -LCB- months late, on Dec. 31, 1993. <ORGANIZATION> Eurotunnel </ORGANIZATION> insists it will be completed by its mid-1993 deadline. Workers on both sides of the channel began drilling toward each other in mid-1987. One tunnel, the service tunnel, is more than half-finished, but much work remains on the other two, which will carry trains in opposite directions. The trains are to allow passengers, cars and freight to travel between <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in three hours.

 An affluent <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> doctor and his wife are facing prostitution-related charges for allegedly conducting a phony research project that included a sex tour of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> college campuses. <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, 60, faces a charge of promoting prostitution while his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Steffen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, 44, faces a prostitution charge, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> police Sgt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> said last week. The Woods were originally ordered to appear in court today, but <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> assistant district attorney <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoar </PERSON> said today that attorneys agreed to delay the appearance while the investigation continued. If convicted, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> faces up to five years in prison and a $ 100,000 fine, Mrs. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> up to a year and a $ 2,500 fine. A 19-year-old <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> student who allegedly participated in a `` research'' session with the <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> is charged with prostitution. The <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, couple visited the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> campus two weeks ago, telling male students they were `` evaluating the sexual potential of the mature female'' for an <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> project and would pay participants at least $ 10 for the encounter, <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> distributed `` letters of introduction'' explaining the supposed research project to young men on campus, <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> said. The couple were arrested after police, tipped by two students, sent an undercover officer posing as a student to their hotel. Police later found a list of schools including <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victoria </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> said. `` They were traveling the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> with major universities on their itinerary,'' <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> said. `` As I understand from a background check in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, they're real affluent and giving away this kind of money is n't going to hurt them any.'' The 19-year-old was identified through photographs the <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> took and through a form listing biographical and sexual information about him, <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> said. Police were unable to locate a second man who appeared to have taken part in another session, he said. `` Because there was money exchanged for a sexual act, it was prostitution,'' <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 There are just so many ways that you can sell dog food, but <PERSON> Ralston </PERSON> <PERSON> Purina </PERSON> has found another one. In a full-page ad in Monday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis-based </LOCATION> purveyor of <PERSON> Puppy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chow </PERSON> claimed that `` If more dogs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ate <PERSON> Purina </PERSON> <PERSON> Hi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pro </PERSON>, it would seem like there were less dogs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' Under that headline, there is a large picture of a disgusted businessman, standing on one foot while examining the bottom of his left shoe. He is not looking for gum on his heel. `` Hi Pro's high digestibility means smaller, firmer stools,'' the ad advises. `` The more nutrients a dog digests, the less passes through his system _ and onto our sidewalks.'' This is not what a Times reader expects with breakfast. A call to <PERSON> Ralston </PERSON> <PERSON> Purina </PERSON> was referred to company spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>; he said he needed to do some research before he could talk about the ad. `` I'll get all the scoop and the dirt on it and I'll call you right back,'' he said. When he called back, he was a font of dog food information. `` When you _ well, not you, but when your dog eats, his system absorbs the nutrients and the rest passes through. I do n't know of any polite way to discuss this.'' Normal dog foods have a digestibility rating of 70 percent _ meaning 70 percent is absorbed and the rest passes through. Hi Pro's rating is 82 percent, so `` less is coming out the other end,'' <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ralston </PERSON> <PERSON> Purina </PERSON> did no extensive field testing on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> streets before plunging ahead with its ad campaign, which consists of the ad in the Times and upcoming placards on telephone kiosks around the city. Hi-Pro itself is not a new product; the company has been selling it for more than a decade. `` We do n't think for a moment that we have the solution to the ` Oops, I stepped in it' problem in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' the ad says. `` But perhaps we can help a little _ by making the pickups a little quicker and easier for dog owners. And even when the scofflaws wo n't pick up, the mess wo n't be quite as messy.'' <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is the only city slated for the ad campaign. `` Very few cities have that same urban lifestyle,'' he said. No television ads are planned. `` It would be difficult, would n't it? he suggested. He said the company did not expect any, uh, flak from readers who might be offended by the ad and its depiction of an unfortunate pedestrian. `` There's actually nothing on the bottom of his shoe, is there?'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Will Use Hitchcock Thriller to Study Copyright Rights</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it will use the famous <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON> thriller `` Rear Window'' to decide a copyright dispute in which millions of dollars, and possibly the future of some movie classics, are at stake. The justices said they will hear arguments on behalf of actor <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>'s heirs and others seeking to prevent a literary agent from sharing in profits from the motion picture's re-release The agent, <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Abend </PERSON>, in 1971 purchased a copyright to the short story on which `` Rear Window'' was based. <PERSON> Abend </PERSON> paid $ 650 to <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> for the copyright. He filed a federal lawsuit seeking a share of the more than $ 12 million in revenue that `` Rear Window'' has generated since 1983, when the 1954 movie was released once again in theaters and for the first time on video casettes and over cable television. `` Rear Window'' is based on a short story, `` It Had to Be Murder,'' that was first published in February 1942 in Dime Detective Magazine. The copyright was owned by the story's author, <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woolrich </ORGANIZATION>, who sold the separate motion picture rights in 1945 for $ 9,250. `` Rear Window,'' starring <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> and directed by <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>, had many elements not contained in the original short story. <PERSON> Woolrich </PERSON> died in 1968 without any surviving spouse or children and left his property to a trust administered by <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abend </PERSON> said in his suit that his copyright was infringed by the re-release of `` Rear Window.'' He also said the film distributors _ including <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>'s heirs _ interfered with his plans to contract with Home Box Office for a new play and TV version of the story. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, ruled in <PERSON> Abend </PERSON>'s favor last December, ordering a lower court to hear his suit for damages. The appeals court noted that its ruling is in conflict with a 1977 decision by the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The appeals court noted that before 1976 federal law permitted a copyright to be renewed for 28 years after the initial 28-year copyright period ended. The law was amended in 1976 to provide for copyright protection for the life of the author plus 50 years _ but only to works copyrighted after Jan. 1, 1978. In <PERSON> Abend </PERSON>'s case, the appeals court said he is entitled to copyright renewal protection even though <PERSON> Woolrich </PERSON> died before the copyright was renewed. The appeals court acknowledged that the success of `` Rear Window'' was due to `` the collaborative efforts of many talented individuals other than <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woolrich </ORGANIZATION>.'' Nonetheless, the appeals court said <PERSON> Woolrich </PERSON>'s contribution was significant and <PERSON> Abend </PERSON> still must be allowed to seek damages for copyright infringement. But the court barred <PERSON> Abend </PERSON> from blocking distribution of `` Rear Window.'' Such an injunction could deny `` the public the opportunity to view a classic film for many years to come,'' the appeals court said. Some of the nation's leading motion picture producing companies are supporting the appeal by <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>'s heirs. They said that thousands of films based on books, plays and short stories might have to be withdrawn from distribution if the 9th Circuit court ruling stands. The case is <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Abend </PERSON>, 88-2102.

 A search for memorabilia to display for <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s hundredth birthday turned up a <PERSON> Bennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> clarinet and the ribbon cut on opening night in 1891, the hall's archivist said Monday. Archivist <PERSON> Gino </PERSON> <PERSON> Francesconi </PERSON> is looking for more souvenirs for special exhibitions in 1990 and 1991. `` People have responded from all over the country. It's just been fantastic,'' he said. `` But we're fighting the clock now. We've given ourselves until March to look for material.'' So far the search has turned up the silver trowel used by <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>, to lay the concert hall's cornerstone in 1890 and a ribbon that was cut on opening night in 1891. <PERSON> Bennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelson </PERSON>, donated one of her father's clarinets, and lots of photographs and recordings have surfaced. `` We're desperately searching now for posters prior to 1960,'' <PERSON> Francesconi </PERSON> said. `` Most of those are just hanging on people's walls I ca n't believe that there are n't posters of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>, <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Toscanini </PERSON> out there.'' At the top of <PERSON> Francesconi </PERSON>'s wish list: `` I would give anything for a ticket from opening night, 1891. I know it's out there. ... I was told by a collector that he had seen it five or six years ago.'' Composers are being asked to write down a few measures of their music that was performed at the hall, then sign it.

<TEXT>
 Anglican leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> and Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> signed a document Monday committing their churches to eventually heal their 450-year-old split but recognizing they still had a long way to go. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>'s first official visit to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> yielded few other visible signs of progress in relations between the world's two largest groups of Christians. However, <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> said he had built trust with <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> officials during four days of talks and that their commitment to seeking unity was no mere `` academic exercise.'' `` The way in which the conversations we have had together bear fruit will come about gradually,'' he told a news conference. Among major points separating the churches is the doctrine of papal infallibility, which applies to Roman Catholic beliefs such as the Immaculate Conception of the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and her assumption to heaven after death. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> is the fourth archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> to visit the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> since the late <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> did so in 1960, ending four centuries of estrangement that began when King <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON> formed his own church after the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> refused to grant him an annulment of his marriage. Talks have been under way since 1966 on a theological framework for unifying the world's 850 million Roman Catholics and 70 million Anglicans. The document signed Monday said: `` We here solemnly recommit ourselves and those we represent to the restoration of visible unity and full ecclesial communion.'' But it noted the ordination of women in some of the Anglican Communion's 27 self-governing provinces, such as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, `` prevents reconciliation between us even where there is otherwise progress toward agreement.'' Nonetheless, Cardinal <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Willebrands </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promoting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>, said `` obstacles are there to be considered and overcome.'' <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, the head of the state <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION>, repeatedly emphasized one of the advances in Anglican-Catholic talks _ an Anglican proposal to grant the pope a `` universal primacy'' over Anglicans. Other advances in recent years have included a draft agreement on how people's souls are saved. But many practical barriers to unity remain, including differences on the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> ban on artificial birth control; some Anglican churches' acceptance of abortion and divorce; the role of lay people in the church; and the Anglican practice of allowing married priests. Still, Anglican-Catholic talks are considered among the most promising inter-faith discussions in which the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> is involved, and Anglican officials say they expect some kind of unity in the 21st century. While both sides described the Anglican-Catholic meetings as extremely friendly, <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>'s speeches expressed more eagerness about unification than the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s. Willebrands indicated the hesitancy of some <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials when he discussed a delay in the church's response to a 7-year-old Anglican-Catholic report on possible theological agreements. `` We have often to consider in the church at large ... problems of internal struggles or differences of opinion, etcetera, and it is rather new to consider officially ecumenical documents,'' he said. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> left the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> meetings with the promise <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> officials would respond soon to the 1982 report by the theological commission. That report included agreements on the Eucharist and priesthood and said Anglicans could recognize the pope as a universal primate, but with somewhat reduced powers. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>'s appeals for a leadership role for the pope drew fire from the Rev. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Protestant leader and anti-pope activist, who charged at an impromptu news conference that <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> was trying to `` dethrone the queen and enthrone the pope'' in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> said he envisioned a spiritual rather than political role for the pope, aimed at helping churches to promote religious practice.

 Police arrested an opposition leader and eight supporters who were touring remote provinces urging people to join a boycott of the military-controlled government, a fellow opposition politician said. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, a former candidate for vice president, was arrested with the others on Sunday in <LOCATION> Veraguas </LOCATION> province, 180 miles west of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON>, a fellow <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democraty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader. The Panamanian Defense Forces announced in a statement that the opposition figures were freed today. Their released could not be confirmed. The statement came shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> would go on a hunger strike. The opposition has engaged in a campaign of urging people to delay paying taxis and utility bills as a way of increasing economic pressure on the government led by military strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The opposition also advocates a boycott of the lottery and gambling casinos, which the government controls along with most of the country's utilities. The Civic Democratic Opposition Alliance, which includes the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, identified the other eight as party activists <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, his wife <PERSON> Mabel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sossa </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Gina </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantovani </PERSON>, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>, <PERSON> Temistocles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Obaldia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lima </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> was one of two opposition vice presidential candidates in May 7 national elections on a ticket led by <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, who was in the 13th day of a hunger strike today as part of the anti-Noriega campaign. The government annulled the May 7 election when returns showed the opposition winning by a landslide. In a statement Sunday, <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> called <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>'s arrest `` another symptom of despair by the dictatorship of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to repress the last vestiges of freedom and democracy that remain in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' The government, which depends heavily on revenues from the lottery and casinos, has been short of funds since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed trade and other economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> soon after federal courts in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges in 1988. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, and his other running mate <ORGANIZATION> Guillermo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> want <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to respect the results of the May elections.

<TEXT>
 A state legislator who spent the last four months in jail for drunken driving resigned Monday amid pressure from his colleagues, including threats by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans to try to expel him. State Rep. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dutko </PERSON>, an eight-term lawmaker from <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, is an acknowledged alcoholic with a history of drunken driving incidents dating to 1973. During his time in jail, he has donated his $ 42,670 salary to drug and alcohol treatment programs. Lawmakers had become increasingly concerned about the effect of <PERSON> Dutko </PERSON>'s jailing on the Legislature's integrity. But they were reluctant to expel someone who was convicted of a misdemeanor rather than a felony because it would be setting a precedent. The resignation came after last week's hint by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillegonds </PERSON> that he would call for an expulsion vote or at least censure if the situation did n't change. <PERSON> Dutko </PERSON> twice said he'd resign, but backed down both times. He was awaiting results of a floundering recall effort and his aides said he still gets letters from constituents who do n't think he should step down. `` I am sure that many people will criticize me for not stepping down sooner, but, in all honesty, I could not walk away from the job and the people I love without a fight,'' <PERSON> Dutko </PERSON> said in his resignation letter. He was jailed May 24, serving six-month and one-year sentences concurrently. His scheduled release, counting time off for good behavior, is Jan. 3.

<TEXT>
 Renovation of an officers' club at the largest <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> cost nearly three times the original pricetag of $ 4.5 million, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report released Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had requested the review, citing reports of construction and funding abuses. Work on the club at <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> totaled $ 12.8 million due to the use of incomplete and misleading data, design changes that had to be made after construction began and structural problems with the building, the report said. In fact, the facility was so structurally unsound contractors were forced to raze all of the building except for the kitchen and several small walls, said the review conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Inspector General. `` We had an officers' club that began as a <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagon </ORGANIZATION> and ended as a Mack Truck rolling over anyone who got in its way,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leath </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on readiness. The report found that the original cost proposals for construction of the club were based on inaccurate information. After the work began, 130 design changes were made at a cost of about $ 1.6 million. In addition, the review found that management `` had not operated the club system efficiently, effectively or profitably from fiscal 1984 to fiscal 1987.'' <PERSON> Leath </PERSON>, who released the report, said enlisted officers at the base saw `` their financially sound clubs go into the hole several million dollars. These operations lost $ 10,000 a day as management was diverted to throw lavish parties for thousands of people.'' `` This report reads like a base operations horror story,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON>' B. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, another member of the subcommittee. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, in comments included in the report, said the service has begun follow-up audits and the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> is looking into whether civil or criminal charges are warranted.

<TEXT>
 Lebanese legislators meeting here Monday put aside the problem of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military presence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to discuss ways to disarm unruly militiamen and draft a national charter to end the country's civil war. New tensions surfaced, however, over a surprise visit to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by two key Moslem militia chieftains, <PERSON> Druse </PERSON> warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> and his Shiite Moslem civil war ally, <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>. Most of the 63 parliamentarians meeting here _ 33 <ORGANIZATION> Christians </ORGANIZATION> and 30 Moslems _ interpreted the trip as an Iranian attempt to undermine the conference, under way since Saturday, conference sources said. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> heads the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia and <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> commands the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Together, the two factions comprise about 12,000 fighters. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> as saying: `` We are vehemently opposed to the plan submitted by the tripartite <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> committee to solve the crisis in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' The committee, composed of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, has proposed a peace plan that includes a series of political reforms designed to end the Christian domination of government, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the army and the judiciary in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The conference sources said the parliamentarians on Monday were going over the proposed national reconciliation charter `` point by point.'' The charter would serve as an alternative to an unwritten national covenant reached among the various sects in 1943, when <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` This plan does not conform with the wishes and aspirations of the Moslems. This plan ... will result in the division of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> are <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main allies. Their support and that of their rival <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militias is essential for implementing any agreement that may be reached in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>. Despite political problems, a cease-fire called by the Arab mediators Sept. 22 to end six months of fierce artillery battles between the Syrians and Christians was holding. The Christians' demand that a timetable for the withdrawal of the Syrian army from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> be workd out before political reforms hampered progress during Saturday and Sunday. But <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Faisal </PERSON>, steered the deputies away from arguments, persuading them to discuss instead the proposed political reforms. <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> is sitting in on the Parliament debates along with his Moroccan and Algerian counterparts, <PERSON> Abdel-Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Filali </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bouallam </PERSON> <PERSON> Belsayeh </PERSON>. The deputies also discussed how to disarm militia factions whose military strength has eroded government authority. The sources said several suggestions were being examined for disbanding the militias, including attaching some of them to various military corps. They said most deputies appeared to favor a timetable, phasing Syrian withdrawal from Moslem sectors of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> over two years while the country's constitutional structure, virtually dismantled by the war, is rebuilt. But most of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> deputies, backed by some Moslems allied with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s rival in the Arab world, demanded an immediate Syrian withdrawal. The Syrian army has 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, controlling 70 percent of the country. The troops entered <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1976, a year after the civil war broke out, under an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate. Christian leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who is backed by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, says the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> abrogated their peacekeeping mandate by openly siding with the Moslems.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> urged the legislature on Monday to impose a 15-month ban on strikes that he says are wrecking the Soviet economy and threatening development. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> spoke at the end of a stormy two-hour legislative debate on a proposal of emergency economic measures put forward by First Deputy Premier <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> urged legislators to discuss the strike ban overnight and be ready to vote on it Tuesday. He referred to the possible ban on strikes as a `` necessary measure ... which are called for to protect democratization from anarchy and irresponsible management.'' Plans for future economic development are `` under threat'' because of the strikes, he said. Emergency measures to bolster the rapidly faltering economy overshadowed Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>'s lengthy presentation of a package of legislation covering the government's long-term proposals on property, ownership and use of land, and taxes. <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON> told the legislature the Soviet economy had lost $ 6.15 billion in July and August alone due to strikes and that supplies of fuel are low enough that the country might be unable to supply enough heat to see Soviet citizens through the winter. The most damaging of a series of strikes to hit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this year was a walkout in July by thousands of coal miners in the far north, <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, and the <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Basin </PERSON> of the eastern <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. That strike alone cost the country millions of rubles, and the government agreed to a package of economic and social improvements that officials say will cost about $ 3 billion. Strikes also have become a way of expressing ethnic discontent. Such actions have idled the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region, the center of a dispute between the neighboring <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republics of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, Russian and other workers walked off jobs at factories and offices during the summer to protest laws that they said favored the majority Moldavians and Estonians. After legislators expressed contradictory viewpoints during a debate, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed they return Tuesday to vote on the strike ban, and an overwhelming majority agreed, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The package of government proposals also calls for imposing a `` special form of administration'' on railroads in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, with the ministries of railroads, defense and interior responsible for protecting the railroads and their workers. Armenian activists say Azerbaijani railroad workers recently have blocked the trains that <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> depends upon for 80 percent of the goods brought in from other parts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Food stores have been emptied of many basic goods and there is no fuel even for vehicles such as ambulances. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said when the Supreme Soviet opened its fall session Sept. 25 that decisive steps would have to be taken if rails to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> were not cleared. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> and radical deputies both named the law on property as the most important of five key economic reforms presented to the legislature, but they disagreed on what it should say. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said the central government must learn to refrain from interfering in local economic affairs _ including its tendency to claim all forms of property for itself. `` As long as about 90 percent of the basic means of production belong in the framework of one owner _ the government _ all talk about developing a market will remain empty words, and progress is impossible,'' he said. But progressive Deputy <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobchak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> said the government's proposal still started from the point of view that the state had priority of ownership, and individuals were last. He said it should be just the opposite. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said the government saw no reason to allow private ownership of land but supported expanded rights for farmers who lease land on long-term contracts from collective and state farms.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says East German Leader Will Step Down After Anniversary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> will likely step down after upcoming celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of his Communist nation, a newspaper reported Monday. The Bonn-based Die <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s doctors have determined he is suffering from a `` total deterioration of his internal organs.'' The conservative newspaper said `` there are indications'' the 77-year-old <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> will be replaced soon after the celebrations this weekend. It did not name its sources. Die <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> said that in addition to suffering from gallbladder ailments, <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> is plagued by pancreatic disorders. West German news reports in August said <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was suffering from cancer, but those reports were denied by East German officials. East German media have said only that <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> is recovering well from a gallbladder operation. Die Welt's report was to appear in its Tuesday edition. A summary of its report was telexed to other news media in advance. The report came as <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> copes with the exodus of thousands of its citizens to the West. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> opened its Western border Sept. 11, defying its Communist ally, and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> has agreed to free thousands who had holed themselves up in West German embassies in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.

 Actor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, who once got a loan from a company with reported ties to <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> and <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, is one of 61 unindicted co-conspirators named in the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> case, according to court papers. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> real estate developers <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, and the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' children, <PERSON> Irene </PERSON>, <PERSON> Imee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, are among the unindicted co-conspirators named in documents filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. An unindicted co-conspirator may have done something to advance an alleged criminal conspiracy, without necessarily knowing he or she was doing it. An indictment last October charged that Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and her late husband, ousted <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, stole $ 168 million from the Philippine treasury. The trial is set to begin in March. One of Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' co-defendants, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, listed the unindicted co-conspirators in pretrial motion papers asking for more information about evidence the government plans to present. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> bought a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> estate once owned by <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> for $ 1.2 million in 1981. The deal was financed by <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s own money, <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the seller, said his attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>. In late 1983, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> used the increased value of the property to get a five-year loan from <ORGANIZATION> Calno </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> N.V. </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antilles </LOCATION>, which reportedly had ties with the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said the actor could not comment until asking his attorneys to clarify the ramifications, if any, of being an unindicted co-conspirator. The actor said through a spokesman in March 1986 that while he had met <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, she had no financial interest in his home. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, who often has served as an escort for <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and other celebrities, is known for his perpetual tan and his portrayal of a vampire in the movie, `` Love at First Bite.'' He and Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> have denied rumors linking them romantically; Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said they were just good friends. Two other unindicted co-conspirators, the <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> brothers, told a congressional hearing that they managed the <ORGANIZATION> Marcoses </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate investments. The <ORGANIZATION> Bernsteins </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney who represents the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family, did not immediately return calls to their office for comment.

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A train carrying 125 passengers slammed into a truck Monday after the truck driver apparently was blinded by the sun and failed to see warning lights of a railway crossing. Police said four people were killed. The crash threw four cars off the tracks and injured 26 people, said police. The train from <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, was bound for <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, when the accident occurred near <LOCATION> Varobacka </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Goteborg </LOCATION>. Police spokesman <PERSON> Ove </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> said most of the injured were from <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and one was in critical condition. Six were reported seriously hurt. `` I saw how he -LRB- the truck driver -RRB- pulled down his cap and squinted against the sun before he accelerated to cross the tracks. The warning lights were working,'' said a witness, <PERSON> Ake </PERSON> <PERSON> Strandberg </PERSON>, who was quoted by the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION>. The truck, loaded with asphalt, was ripped apart and chunks of metal were thrown hundreds of yards. The truck driver and three people on the train died. The collision ripped a large hole in the side of the first sleeping car where the passengers were killed. The train's engineer was quoted as saying he tried to catch the driver's attention, then threw himself onto the floor an instant before ramming the vehicle. He escaped with minor injuries. It was the worst train accident in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> since a head-on collision in November 1987 killed nine people and injured 130. The national railway company, <PERSON> Statens </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarnvagar </PERSON>, had intended to erect barriers later this month at the crossing.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Raleigh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, the capital city's afternoon newspaper for 110 years, will publish its final edition Nov. 30, the newspaper's publisher said Monday <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said an internal task force had recommended closing The <ORGANIZATION> Raleigh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> as part of a plan to expand and improve The News and Observer, <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>'s morning newspaper. `` The recommendation to cease publication of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raleigh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> was one that was accepted reluctantly, but it was not unexpected,'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. `` For several years, we have watched as afternoon dailies in metropolitan areas closed.

In recent years, afternoon newspapers in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> also have ceased publication. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said no employee layoffs are expected. The news staffs of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and The News and Observer were combined in 1987.

The Times grew from the Raleigh Evening Visitor, founded in 1879.

The Park family of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> bought the Times in 1911, with <PERSON> John </PERSON> A. Park serving as editor and publisher for 44 years.

<HEAD>Soviets Say They've Reformed Psychiatric Abuses</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet authorities have formed an independent commission to monitor psychiatric abuses, an embassy spokesman testified Monday, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts said the reform was not adequate to readmit the Soviets to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Seeking to bolster the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Georgi </PERSON> <PERSON> Markosov </PERSON> of the Soviet Embassy appeared before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel to detail reforms his government has taken to correct psychiatric abuses against political and religious prisoners. The Soviet `` All-Union Scientific Society of Psychiatrists ... is doing its utmost to implement and translate into reality the needed reforms in the field of medical care and psychiatric health,'' said <PERSON> Markosov </PERSON>, reading a statement prepared by the Soviet society for the hearing. `` To prevent the use of psychiatry for non-medical purposes as well as to assure maximum openness in specific cases of misuse of psychiatry, an independent commission has been established, which is composed of eight persons ... The commission is independent from the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> or any -LRB- Communist -RRB- Party or state organs,'' <PERSON> Markosov </PERSON> said. Before this year, it was rare for Soviet officials to testify before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but since January, about a half dozen have done so. <PERSON> Markosov </PERSON> also listed other reforms, including: _ New regulations that led to dropping 736,000 people from so-called psychiatric registration lists <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts said the lists contained 10.2 million names, and were used for job screening. _ New rules that bar forcible commitment to a psychiatric institution without the consent of patients or their relatives, unless the patient poses a physical danger `` Psychiatrists who wrongly hospitalize mentally healthy persons may be sentenced to a two-year prison term.'' _ Abolition in the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> federation, the largest of the 15 Soviet republics, of two laws often used against dissidents _ A ban on the use of sulphazine, a drug made of pulverized sulphur that has been injected into political dissidents, causing extreme pain, fever and disorientation Western experts say it has no medical value. Most of the steps had been publicized previously, but the existence of the commission was not known in the West, said another witness, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor who has written two books on Soviet psychiatric abuses and was a member of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation that visited Soviet psychiatric institutions this year. `` It remains to be seen whether it is indeed vigorous and independent,'' said <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which supported the work of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation, has voted to oppose readmission of the Soviet group to the world body, which is scheduled to meet in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, Oct. 11-16. `` It is my sincere hope as well as the hope of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, that there will be a time in the near future when we can whole-heartedly welcome the <ORGANIZATION> All-Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatrists </ORGANIZATION> and Narcologists of the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> into the World Psychiatric Assocation,'' testified <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON>, head of international programs for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> organization. `` It is also our concern that, unfortunately, this time has not yet arrived,'' said <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON>. Soviet health officials who in the past sent dissidents to psychiatric institutions remain in senior government posts, said <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON>, and they could resume their abuses if there is a conservative reaction along the lines of the crackdown in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> this summer. The officials he mentioned were <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON>, the health minister, <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Zharikov </PERSON>, last year appointed the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatrists </ORGANIZATION> and Narcologists, <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morozov </PERSON>, who for decades has headed the <ORGANIZATION> Serbsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> where many political dissidents have been held in psychiatric care, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Churkin </PERSON>, chief psychiatrist of the ministry of health, and <PERSON> Marat </PERSON> <PERSON> Vartanyan </PERSON>. These conservatives, said <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON>, `` have a well justified fear that if there is a genuine reform in Soviet psychiatry, they will be swept out of office.'' Senior Soviet psychiatric authorities want to be readmitted to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON>, but `` the reformers within Soviet psychology are opposed to it.'' Denying the Soviets readmission to the world body, said <PERSON> Reddaway </PERSON>, `` would delay genuine reform of Soviet psychiatry ...'' Soviet psychiatric abuses have been publicized for years by Western experts, some of whom also testified Monday, and are now being discussed more openly in the Soviet press. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Delegation to Assess Soviet Psychiatry, which visited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this year, reported to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that `` while some victims have been released, forced incarceration under the guise of treatment for insanity, remains an institutional problem,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., who presided over the hearing `` Perhaps even worse, the perpetrators of these abuses remain in key leadership positions in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> psychiatry,'' said <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> on Health and the Environment.

<TEXT>
 Four men whose 42-foot sailboat was overturned in a storm say they drifted for nearly four months in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and survived by trapping rainwater, spearing fish and eating seaweed. `` We needed a miracle, and we got one,'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> skipper <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glennie </PERSON> said after the crewmen washed ashore Sunday and were rescued on the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The four were all reported in good condition. After wind pushed the overturned boat ashore, the survivors said they spent their first night on land in 120 days, sheltered from rain under a tree in the bush of the island, about 60 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION>. On Sunday, they walked through bush until breaking into an empty cabin and finding warm clothes. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Speck </PERSON>, an island resident, first met the sailors at the cabin. `` At first I thought these guys were nuts,'' Speck said. `` I could n't believe it.'' The crew included owner and skipper <PERSON> Glennie </PERSON>, a sailor who designed the craft for long-distance cruising; <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hellriegel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nalepka </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, who was in the second of two years as caterer for the Outward Bound program in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nalepka </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, said he lost 25 pounds but was declared fit by doctors in <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION> after a two-hour hospital visit. `` We never gave up hope. He kept hoping he was safe. ... This is wonderful,'' she said. `` It's just an amazing story.'' The sailors' trimaran <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Noelle </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Picton </LOCATION>, on the northern coast of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, on June 1 for a three-week <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> cruise that was to take them to <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION>. On the night of June 3, a strong wind grew to a 60-knot gale. `` About six o'clock in the morning there was a huge wave, and it just flipped the boat upside down,'' <PERSON> Glennie </PERSON> said. The boat floated on its crossbeams and cabin top, with the cabin top _ now the floor _ beneath a couple of feet of water, <PERSON> Glennie </PERSON> said. The sailboat's light, buoyant bow rode high, so it always pointed away from the wind, he said. The craft was stable and would not sink unless it had broken apart. The men, jammed four abreast in its 54-inch width, cut a hole through the hull of the yacht to gain dry access outside, without having to swim through the now-watery tunnel of the hatch, <PERSON> Glennie </PERSON> said. The yacht's two emergency locator beacons, designed to transmit for 30 days, were switched on, but there was no sign from jets overhead that their signals were detected. The boat was reported missing June 24 after it failed to arrive in <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION>. For the first few weeks there were survival rations. `` We had plenty of soda stowed in the forward compartment,'' <PERSON> Glennie </PERSON> said. `` We had stacks of apples and kiwifruit and we got plenty of moisture from those. But the drinks were rationed to a few ounces every night. `` After about 40 days, when we had all come to terms with things and began working as a team, we organized ourselves into making a system to collect rainwater.'' They split some plastic piping and placed the pieces together to collect rainwater, which was drained into empty soft drink bottles, <PERSON> Glennie </PERSON> said. They also ate seaweed and speared fish. `` We ate them raw, and we had plenty of vinegar on board to marinate them in,'' he said. The sailors' families had given them up for dead, said <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Glennie </PERSON>'s brother-in-law. `` We were absolutely ecstatic to hear <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s voice on the phone,'' Tomes said. `` We were just so thrilled that he and the rest of the crew are still alive after so many months ... The celebrations are already under way.''

 Nearly 10,000 people marched through <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> on Monday demanding legalization of opposition groups and adoption of democratic reforms in the country's largest such protest since 1953. Witnesses said marchers chanted `` <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>!'' and `` We're staying here! Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is enormously popular among East Germans, who hope his policies of economic and political reforms may some day be adopted by their nation's hard-line leadership. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is expected to visit <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> next weekend to take part in celebrations marking <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 40th anniversary. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s aging orthodox communist leadership has so far rejected the need for reforms. In 1953, workers rose up throughout <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in an ill-fated uprising later crushed by Soviet tanks. The demonstrators Monday also demanded legalization of opposition groups, which have been suppressed by the government. Fledgling opposition groups have rejected fleeing the country or emigration and said they want to work for change in this country of 16.6 million. Tens of thousands of East Germans fled over <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s newly opened border and thousands more were allowed to travel to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this weekend after seeking refuge in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s embassies in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Witnesses said security officials followed the demonstration but did not try to break it up. About 8,000 people took part in a similar march in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> last week.

 An <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> death row inmate who is challenging the state's capital punishment law won a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing Monday. The court's eventual ruling in <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>'s appeal also could affect death row inmates in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, two states that have death penalty laws similar to <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> was convicted of robbing and fatally shooting <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> near <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> in March 1986. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> was robbed in a bar parking lot and then driven in his own car to a secluded area where he was shot. A trial jury heard testimony that <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> fired the fatal shot. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> denied he killed <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, swearing that a co-defendant was the gunman. The jury did not specify whether it found <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> guilty of premeditated murder or `` felony murder,'' the taking of a life during commission of a felony. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>'s lawyers sought unsuccessfully during his sentencing trial to introduce testimony indicating that the jury had been undecided whether <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> killed <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>'s conviction and death sentence in a ruling that conflicts with a decision by the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The federal appeals court previously overturned a key provision of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s death penalty statute in the case of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, convicted of murdering reporter <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON>, who had been investigating organized crime for The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, died June 11, 1976, nine days after his car exploded. The 9th Circuit, setting aside <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>'s death sentence, said <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s death penalty law unconstitutionally deprives defendants of the right to a jury trial because the judge, not the jury, decides whether an accused murderer is guilty of a crime warranting capital punishment. The appeals court has jurisdiction in nine Western states, including <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The case is <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, 88-7351.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> met with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Monday on <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace efforts and said he saw a `` golden opportunity'' for a breakthrough between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Palestinians. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said failing to seize the opportunity `` would be a grave mistake'' and that he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agreed `` to work closely together in order to utilize the existing momentum.'' `` The continuation of the status quo is hazardous to both'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> leader told reporters after an Oval Office session lasting nearly an hour. However, even as <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> sought to promote his plan, which includes a demand that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> agree in principal to giving up seized lands, aides to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader does not intend to alter his own Palestinian peace initiative. Monday's White House session came amid new concern that settling Jewish immigrants from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> could threaten peace efforts. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials reacted coolly to an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> request for $ 400 million in housing loan guarantees for about 100,000 Jewish emigres from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials have said some dwellings probably will be in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> policy is to oppose additional settlements in the occupied territories,'' Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said. And presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declared, `` Our policy is we do n't allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to be used for resettlement in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>.'' Still, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> were both upbeat about peace prospects. `` I think it's fair to say that we all hope that conditions exist for progress,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. The Egyptian president, after his meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, said: `` We believe the potential is great for further progress. ... It would be a grave mistake to miss the golden opportunity existing today.'' In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader does not intend to alter his own peace plan despite pressure from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or the rival Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` Only five months have passed'' since <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> presented his plan for elections as a first step toward negotiations, and the prime minister `` does not see any reason to change it,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan calls for elections in the occupied territories to choose delegates for negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. However, final status on the lands occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war would be decided later. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> told reporters here the essential next step in the peace process is to persuade the Israelis and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to enter into a dialogue `` without preconditions.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s meeting came as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was seeking to persuade a reluctant <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to open discussions with <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> based on <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s proposals. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials regard the 10-point Egyptian plan as a complement to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal for elections in which Palestinians would select representatives to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on limited self-government in the occupied territories. `` The Egyptian ten points ... do not represent a competing proposal. They represent a means of getting a dialogue established,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said on Monday. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> made a similar comment. A key element of <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s proposal is the convening of talks between Israelis and <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> _ so far resisted by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader also opposes <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s suggestion that voting rights be extended to Arabs living in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and to Palestinians who live outside the occupied territories. And <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has rejected <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s suggestion that the outcome of any negotiations be self-determination for the Palestinians. On prospects of a summit with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> noted that he had talked to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> by phone last Friday and discussed preparations for such a meeting. But, he said, `` such a meeting should come out of something. Otherwise, it would have negative reactions from the peoples of both sides. I do n't want to make complications. That's why any meeting needs a thorough preparation.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, meanwhile, told reporters at a luncheon on Monday that the administration would be `` very supportive ... -LRB- of -RRB- a dialogue between <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> that can be meaningful.'' After visiting the president, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> had lunch at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> reaffirmed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing for <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s efforts to help broker the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. `` We wo n't get to peace until Palestinians and Israelis speak to each other,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Both <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said they wished to withhold comment on specifics dealing with Palestinian representation until after the Israeli Cabinet meets on Thursday on the subject. At the same time, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> confirmed, in part, a report in an Egyptian newspaper, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhbar </PERSON>, that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had proposed a joint commission to pave the way for elections in the territories. `` I'm not sure you would call it a commission,'' he said. `` What has been suggested is the possibility that the three nations -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> -RRB- could in some way determine the Palestinian representation with respect to the dialogue.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s 10-point proposal stops short of demanding the establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, and it contains other features which have attracted favorable comment from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> urged the parliament Monday to impose a 15-month ban on strikes, which he said are wrecking the economy and endangering development. He spoke at the end of a stormy two-hour debate on emergency economic measures proposed by <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON>, the first deputy premier, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> urged legislators to discuss the proposals and be ready to vote on Tuesday. He referred to the possible ban on strikes as a `` necessary measure ... called for to protect democratization from anarchy and irresponsible management.'' Plans for future economic development are `` under threat'' from the strikes, he said. <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON> said the ailing economy lost $ 6.15 billion in July and August because of strikes, and fuel shortages might mean inadequate heat this winter. Proposals for the next 15 months include `` a prohibition on conducting strikes ... in all branches of the economy,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The package also calls for a `` special form of administration'' for railroads in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, with the ministries of railroads, defense and interior responsible for protecting the lines and their workers. Armenian activists say Azerbaijani railroad workers have blocked the trains that carry 80 percent of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s goods from other parts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Food stores have been emptied of many basic goods and even ambulances lack fuel. When the Supreme Soviet opened its fall session Sept. 25, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said decisive steps would be required if the rail lines remained blocked. The neighboring republics in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> are in conflict over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a region that is part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> but has a predominantly Armenian population. This year's most damaging strike was a walkout in July by thousands of coal miners in the far north, <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, and the <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Basin </PERSON> of the eastern <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. It cost millions of dollars, and the government agreed to economic and social reforms officials say will cost about $ 3.08 billion. Strikes have become a common way of expressing ethnic discontent. In addition to the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> dispute, <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> and other workers have struck factories in <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> to protest laws favoring native populations.

 Two administration officials caught the brunt of criticisms Monday for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s refusal at the education summit to commit to an increase in federal funding for the nation's schools Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> irked a luncheon meeting of black Republicans, telling them, `` Our role is not one of funding.'' Across the street, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> key </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who helped craft <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s education budget, drew angry responses from members of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> when he said the $ 353 billion estimated to be spent this year on education by all levels of government is sufficient. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON> were keeping to the line held by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the conclusion of the two-day summit last week with the nation's governors who agreed jointly to develop national performance goals by February <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bins </PERSON> of the black <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> group, the Council of 100, sharply questioned <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> on the administration's commitment to ensure adequate funding to educate minority and disadvantaged youths. `` I am here to remind our nation that the problem -LRB- of equity education -RRB- has not been solved,'' said Bins, noting that about 80 percent of most state legislators are from `` suburban or affluent white communities.'' `` There is no clear indication on the scene today that they are going to take the advice from the governors,'' Bins added. Bins, deputy director of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION>, was assured by <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, the first Hispanic to head the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continues to fight for equality. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> cited the president's support for funding specialized magnet schools and for allowing parents to select the school their children will attend. <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON> drew harsh criticism when he discussed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stances on funding and choice with the schools council, which is part of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` There was a general recognition that money was n't the issue,'' said <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON> in summarizing the summit. `` The biggest challenge for all of us _ on the federal, state and local levels _ is to find ways to deploy the resources'' that are already available for education, <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kafoury </PERSON>, a member of the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> school board, said more money is needed for schools and stressed that to imply otherwise would be `` disingenuous at best.'' `` I thought this area had been declared a drug free zone and here I am wondering what you've been smoking,'' said a sarcastic <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>. `` You've got to look at what we're doing with the money.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s was greeted with cheers and applause when he compared the amounts spent on the military and the savings and loan associations bailout with federal spending on education. `` He bailed out the S & amp; Ls. The man did n't say he wanted to be the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L president, he said he wanted to be the education president,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, referring to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pledge during last year's presidential campaign `` What we need is more resources, not someone talking platitudes. The real test is what are the resources and where are they coming from.'' <ORGANIZATION> NSBA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oglesby </PERSON> admitted the group `` beat up on <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON>'' but said it was because many of the members are frustrated volunteers.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is equipping some of its tanks with several layers of a special armor that can withstand certain types of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The Soviets have bolted two and three layers of reactive armor boxes to their T-72 tanks _ a discovery members of the committee made during their trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in August, said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>. Reactive armor, unlike the traditional type of armor, goes beyond merely protecting against an oncoming missile or projectile The reactive armor consists of a steel box that includes layers of steel plates and explosives. The rationale for the reactive armor box is that a missile may hit the box and set off the explosive inside but the steel plate will block further damage. To combat the reactive armor boxes, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has equipped its anti-tank weapons with dual-charge warheads. These missiles include a first charge, which penetrates the box and sets off the explosive, and a second charge, which, when it ignites a fraction of a second later, can break through the steel plates and penetrate the tank. The Soviet action makes it difficult for even a dual-charge warhead to penetrate past the armor. `` This ca n't be anything but bad news to forces planning to defend against these tanks with current anti-tank weapons,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. `` At the same time, our anti-tank weapons should retain high effectiveness against Soviet armored fighting vehicles, whose numbers are being increased as tanks are withdrawn from Soviet forces in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The Soviets have said they are withdrawing 5,300 tanks from Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> while increasing the number of infantry fighting vehicles, which are thinner-skinned, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. The committee plans to release a full assessment of the U.S.-Soviet military balance later this month.

<HEAD>Study: Cutting Salt, Losing Weight Cuts Risk of High Blood Pressure</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 People in danger of developing high blood pressure cut their risk in half in a new study by reducing salt and alcohol intake, losing weight and exercising. It is the first study to show that such steps, often recommended for people who already have high blood pressure, can also reduce risk of developing the condition, said researcher <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Stamler </PERSON>. The steps might prevent 1 million cases of high blood pressure over five years in people 30 to 44, and perhaps additional cases in other age groups, she said. <PERSON> Stamler </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, spoke in an interview before presenting the work at an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> science reporters conference. The work also appears in Friday's issue of the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The research focused on 201 men and women, ages 30 to 44, whose blood pressure was relatively high but within the normal range. Such people are at risk of developing clinical high blood pressure. At the start of the study, in addition to high normal blood pressure, the participants were overweight by at least 10 percent or they had a fast pulse rate of 80 or more beats per minute. About half the group was assigned to an intervention program. It included goals of reducing weight by about 10 pounds if they needed, reducing salt intake to about half the national average, limiting alcohol to two or fewer drinks a day, and exercising for 30 minutes at least three days a week. The other 99 participants were simply followed for the study's duration of five years After five years, 8.8 percent of participants who followed the intervention program developed hypertension, compared to 19.2 percent among the others. <PERSON> Stamler </PERSON> said she did not think any one part of the intervention program produced the difference, but rather the combination of strategies. Weight loss seemed to be particularly effective, however, she said. About 25 percent of the targeted group reached the 10-pound weight loss mark, she said. In addition, average salt intake in the intervention group dropped about 25 percent, and they consumed 30 percent less alcohol than before. Most also exercised more. Federal statistics say that the nation has at least 10 milion people in the age group she studied who have the relatively high but still normal blood pressures, she said. Her results suggest that without intervention, 2 million of them would progress to high blood pressure within five years. But the intervention program might prevent that in half the cases, she said. The results are `` very encouraging,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frolich </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> for High Blood Pressure Research.

<HEAD>CIA Official Predicts Soviet Reforms Will Continue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A senior <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> analyst said Monday that Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might face a revolt among rank-and-file <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members, but that his reforms are likely to survive a backlash. `` Even if there is a temporary setback, I think the process of reform will continue,'' <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Zlotnik </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Soviet Analysis said in a lecture at the <ORGANIZATION> Kennan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Russian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. His remarks reflected a general sense of uncertainty among government and academic experts over the course of Soviet politics in the short term after four years of often tumultuous reform since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power. Asked to comment on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s own description of a deepening economic and political crisis and reference to rumors of a conservative coup in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Zlotnik </PERSON> said, `` Some spark could set things off ... to topple the senior leadership. But no one is in a position to predict when it will come and whether it can be put out quickly.'' `` The crisis is really serious,'' <PERSON> Zlotnik </PERSON> said. `` But so far, I think it is being managed pretty well.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has solidified his position by eliminating conservative opponents in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and by strengthening the role of the Soviet parliament, which this year elected him to a five-year term as president. But the party and parliament may be on a collision course, <PERSON> Zlotnik </PERSON> said, and `` at some point, there is going to be a showdown between those who want a traditional role'' for the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and members of parliament who put faith in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s call to transfer power from the party to the legislature. Most parliamentary deputies are also party members, said <PERSON> Zlotnik </PERSON>, and for at least the next several years they are likely to obey any decision by the ruling Politburo to dump <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> so far has done a good job of `` keeping two steps ahead'' of his rivals, said <PERSON> Zlotnik </PERSON>, `` I wonder whether any politician can keep outguessing the opposition time after time.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, heeding a `` sense of panic'' in the party, has recently taken a more moderate view, asking non-Russian nationalities to curb their drives for independence and asking the legislature to approve a 15-month ban on strikes that he says are disrupting the economy and endangering reform. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has seen the need to rein in the most radical forces,'' <PERSON> Zlotnik </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think he has changed his goals of radically transforming Soviet society ... but he sees a need for stocktaking,'' a respite from the frantic pace of the last four years.

White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would reject any request for aid to resettle immigrants in the occupied lands. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> are home to 1.7 million Palestinians and 70,000 Jewish settlers. They are the scene of a 21-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials say more Soviet Jews will flock to the Jewish state as a result of new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration restrictions that make it more difficult to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and because of worsening economic conditions in their homeland. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s special adviser on Jewish affairs, <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, said one barometer of the interest in emigration is the number of sponsorship offers sent to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s diplomatic mission in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> at the behest of would-be emigrants He said an average of 200 such invitations, needed to start emigration procedures, are received daily. About 200,000 Soviet Jews have requested sponsorship so far this year. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has set a ceiling of 50,000 Soviets to be admitted as refugees next year. An additional 20,000 to 30,000 may enter the country on a so-called parole basis with no government support. `` We do anticipate growing numbers of Jewish immigrants wanting to settle in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` There may be costs associated with that.'' <PERSON> Simcha </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinitz </PERSON>, head of the quasi-governmental <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which helps settle new arrivals, said 100,000 Soviets are expected over the next three to five years. <PERSON> David </PERSON> said the number could reach 150,000. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> estimates resettlement costs at $ 3 billion over three to five years and hopes to get $ 600 million in donations from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jewish groups. It also wants $ 400 million in U.S-government guaranteed loans that would allow it to borrow money from commercial banks at low interest, <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> Spokesman <PERSON> Arieh </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenblatt </PERSON> said. The funding request was made by Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who raised the issue with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` emphasized his symphathy for that problem and committed to look into it'' but details were not discussed. The current American program of financing housing projects limits loan guarantees to $ 25 million per country a year. Officials in <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc say Soviet Jews should be settled in the occupied territories, which <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> sees as an integral part of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Housing Minister <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> drew sharp criticism from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials and <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> leaders when he first voiced the idea last June. Liberal critics said it would deter Soviet Jews who do not want to be thrust into the midst of the Palestinian uprising. <PERSON> Dinitz </PERSON> said the Jewish Agency would not allow its funds to be used in the occupied territories. `` The Jewish Agency, the main body raising funds abroad, is obliged by its policy to use all the funds for absorption in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> proper,'' he said. `` Whatever the government decides, it's government's business, but <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> funds will be used only in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> adviser, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would settle Jews in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> with or without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing. `` We are a sovereign state, and we think this immigration wave should be directed there. If the Americans refuse to give money, we shall take a loan from our own population, but we wo n't stop.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> said a group of settlement leaders was discussing the idea with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and that he was working on a survey of housing and job opportunities in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Another controversial proposal by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Absorption Minister <PERSON> Yizthak </PERSON> <PERSON> Peretz </PERSON> calls for directing the majority of new immigrants to development towns in remote areas of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Jewish activists in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> say many Jews who seek to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would rather stay in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> than go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Some 250,000 Soviet Jews emigrated to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> between 1967 and 1988. Last year, 2,173 out of 18,961 Soviet Jewish emigrants came to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, according to the Jerusalem-based Soviet Jewry Education and Information Center. In January-August this year, 4,175 of the 34,610 Soviet Jewish emigrants came to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and the government expects a total of 7,000 in 1989.

 A Republican lobbyist with former ties to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Monday that he `` played by the rules'' in obtaining lucrative federal housing subsidies. But the head of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel charged he had reaped the benefits of `` a greased, sweetheart deal.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, a former campaign adviser to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and a former business partner of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, underwent hostile questioning from disbelieving members of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel probing scandals at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, who three months ago acknowledged to the same panel that his work amounted to `` influence peddling,'' denied being given an advance tip by insiders at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to the availability of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> subsidies for renovating low-income housing projects, which were prized profit-makers for developers. He said his lobbying firm `` has worked within the existing system at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` We played by the rules,'' <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> said. `` I understand that the subcommittee views the process as fundamentally flawed. I am not here to argue with the subcommittee about the process, or to defend it ...'' Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., took sharp issue with <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>'s description of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> housing project in which <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> was a partner, and which benefited from more than $ 31 million in federal subsidies for renovation and tax `` This was a greased, sweetheart deal, where all the participants knew what the final outcome would be,'' said <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations subcommittee on employment and housing. <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> contended that partners in the development faced normal business risks, including the potential loss of a $ 450,000 downpayment, in buying the 326 units of dilapidated housing and putting together a package of subsidies and financing. But <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> documents showed <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>'s group was assured of the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> subsidies in contacts with top agency officials before it invested the money. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> and his partners also benefitted from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> specifications that were written to exclude other developers. He said it was `` ludicrious'' for <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> to claim he faced any normal business risk. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> produced <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> documents which he said showed <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, former executive assistant to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, was passing along copies of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> project proposals to <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> even though he was not directly involved in them. `` There was no risk here. There was a prearranged deal which went through as it was prearranged,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said. `` There was a sweetheart deal with <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> promised them the units -LRB- of subsidy -RRB- and she delivered on the units. Those are the facts.'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> is one of four former top officials of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, including <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who have refused to testify before the panel by invoking their constitutional rights against self-incrimination. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> has been at the focus of the panel's probe into political favoritism in the awarding of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> subsidies to developers. In one 1986 memo released by the panel, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> had written another <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official should amass `` great wells of power and wield it on my behalf.'' <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> said he did not recall receiving the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> documents, but said they involved a partner, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON>, whom he had introduced to <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>. <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Gay </PERSON>, an associate in <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>'s lobbying firm, testified he met with <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> and discussed the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> project. Another associate in the firm, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, was a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> liason to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> who said he had been in contact with <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> daily while in government. <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> faced questions about his failure in his appearance last June to recall all the HUD-related projects on which he had served as a consultant or lobbyist. <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> said he and his lobbying firm, <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, had failed to fully check all their records but had now produced a complete list. Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, D-Conn., said that involved 21 separate clients Although he faced contentious questioning, <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> was offered reassurance by one of the panel members. Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., said, `` In no way have I ever seen anything related to your activity that would suggest any illegalities. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, however, later told <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> that `` your're trying to be evasive,'' and that while his deal may not have broken laws `` `` it certainly was highly questionable in terms of ethics.'' As a result, <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said, money was denied to `` infintely more worthy projects.'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said subcommittee staff last week visited the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> project in <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, in which <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> are partners. He described it as a `` slum'' with `` shocking'' conditions, including water-damaged apartments with no refrigerators renting for more than $ 700 a month, including federal subsidies. The panel questioned <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> and <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> at length about the renovations and the failure so far to install gutters. <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> said that while 182 units are occupied, construction is still under way and asserted, `` When we are finished with construction, we believe the tenants will be happy.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, embarking on a term laced with controversial issues, said Monday it will decide whether police nationwide may use sobriety checkpoints in trying to curb drunken drivers. The case accepted by the court, which poses the question of whether police officers may use checkpoints to spot drunken drivers, presents the latest test of strength for the court's newly solidified conservative majority. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> courts struck down that state's sobriety checkpoint program as an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, but courts in other states have upheld virtually identical police tactics. In its usual start-of-term flurry, the court issued orders in more than 1,000 cases _ denying review to most and agreeing to study 22. They will be among 150 or so disputes to be decided by the end of the term in July. The court also heard arguments in a <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> desegregation case centering on four city councilmen who voted against a judge's order to pass a legislative package designed to lure subsidized housing to the city's white neighborhoods In addition to that civil rights case, the justices are looking ahead to a term in which they have agreed to decide thorny right-of-privacy arguments in three abortion disputes and the high court's first `` right to die'' controversy. In other action on the first day of its term, the justices: _ Agreed to decide in an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case whether public employers may be forced to put aside partisanship when hiring, promoting and transferring employees _ Turned down the appeals of eight Mafia figures from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> convicted in the 1979 assassinations of crime chieftain <PERSON> Carmine </PERSON> <PERSON> Galante </PERSON> and two of his associates _ Left intact <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s revocation of a $ 300,000-a-year tax break for a men-only golf club that has counted presidents and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> among its members _ Refused to spare an evangelical Christian group in <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, from having to return $ 5.5 million donated by a wealthy ex-member _ Rejected <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s attempt to forestall offshore oil and gas exploration in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> The state had argued that an oil spill there could do more environmental harm than the massive Exxon Valdez spill last March. _ Allowed states to criminally prosecute employers accused of neglecting the health and safety of their employees The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling in an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case that federal workplace regulations do not bar such state prosecutions. The use of police sobriety checkpoints in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> was attacked shortly after state police began using them in 1986. The program was modeled after one used in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. At a checkpoint site, police directed all traffic headed in one direction to a roadside area where officers checked motorists for signs of intoxication. If there was no immediate evidence of intoxication, the motorist was given a traffic safety brochure and allowed to drive away. The average delay was about 30 seconds. If signs of intoxication were detected, a driver was directed to another area for further questioning and perhaps a breath test. At one such checkpoint, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> state police troopers checked 126 vehicles in less than an hour and detained two drivers for sobriety field tests. One driver was arrested on drunken-driving charges. The state police department was sued soon after the checkpoint program began. The lawsuit alleged that the checkpoints violated the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable police searches and seizures. State courts banned the checkpoints, citing `` the potential for an unreasonable, subjective intrusion on individual liberty interests.'' In defending the checkpoint program, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> told the justices that fighting drunken driving is a `` grave and legitimate public interest.'' He said <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s checkpoint program is valid even if it is not the most effective police procedure available or may carry the `` potential of generating fear and surprise in some motorists.'' Lawyers for those who successfully challenged the checkpoint program urged the justices to reject the appeal. They said the `` warrantless, suspicionless seizure'' of a vehicle at a sobriety checkpoint could lead to drivers and passengers being required to get out and being subjected to pat-down searches. They said police officers may use such occasions to inspect a vehicle's contents. In other matters, the court: _ Agreed to use a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> case to decide whether states may prohibit grand jury witnesses from making public their own testimony once the investigation has ended _ Said it will decide whether the government may prohibit soliciting on all Postal Service property, including the sidewalks adjacent to post office buildings _ Left intact a $ 278,600 libel award against a <LOCATION> Pawtucket </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, newspaper by refusing to review a ruling that news stories may be libelous even if they contain no false statement _ Turned down the appeal of eight antiwar activists, including <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrigan </PERSON>, who were convicted of breaking into a King of <LOCATION> Prussia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, plant and damaging two nuclear missile cones _ Agreed to decide in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case whether lawyers who take civil rights cases on a contingency basis may collect a big chunk of their clients' awards _ Let stand the trespassing convictions of three people who attempted to hand out anti-abortion booklets to students outside a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> high school On the same day last July that the justices expanded state authority to make abortions harder to get, they also agreed to study disputes over abortion regulation in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Laws in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> require doctors to notify parents of unmarried minors who seek an abortion. An <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law would require abortion clinics, where the overwhelming majority of abortions are performed, to provide services and equipment now found only in hospitals. The law could force many clinics out of business and drive up the cost of an abortion by nearly $ 50. The court also will decide whether a life-sustaining tube may be removed from the stomach of a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> woman in an irreversible vegetative state. When <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruzan </PERSON>'s parents requested that artificial feeding and hydration be ended for their daughter, hospital officials refused to do so without a court order. The <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> Cruzans </ORGANIZATION>, who say <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> would prefer to die, have no right to order the termination of such treatment.

 Voyager 2 photographed an active geyser or volcano blowing gaseous and frozen nitrogen 5 miles high on <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, proving <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s biggest moon is the solar system's third object with active eruptions, scientists said Monday. `` We caught one in the act!'' said <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Miner </PERSON>, deputy Voyager project scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> news release called the eruptions `` geyser-like phenomenon.'' But with 5-mile-high plumes, they can be considered either volcanoes or giant geysers, said <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, leader of <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON>'s photographic imaging team. Earth and Io, a moon of Jupiter, are the only other bodies in the solar system known to have active volcanoes. Io's volcanoes spew molten sulfur. Images radioed to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> flew past <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> in August showed dark, plume-shaped deposits of material lying on <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s south polar ice cap. At the time, scientists said they believed the deposits were created by volcanoes spewing gas and ice 12 to 20 miles skyward. They said they believed the volcanoes were active or had been active in the past few hundred years. But it was n't until late last week that closer examination of Aug. 24 pictures taken from a distance of 62,000 miles revealed an eruption in progress, <PERSON> Miner </PERSON> said Monday. `` Resembling a smokestack, the narrow stem of the dark plume rises vertically nearly 5 miles, forming a cloud that drifts 90 miles eastward in <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s winds,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said in a stratement. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> made the announcement as Voyager formally ended its two-month close inspection of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, the solar system's fourth-largest planet The one-ton space probe was 34.7 million miles past <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, traveling at 37,337 mph. It was 2.83 billion miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, and had traveled 4.46 billion miles on a curved course since its launch in 1977. Voyager 2 explored Jupiter in 1979, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Voyager 2's encounter with <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> formally started Aug. 5 and it will continue to look back at the planet until December. But the formal end of the encounter was marked by the activation Monday of a new set of computer commands replacing the program that guided the craft and its cameras and instruments through the close examination of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. Voyager 2, like its twin <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> 1, is expected to return information to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> for another 25 or 30 years before its plutonium power generators fail. The probes will measure magnetic fields and electrically charged particles in space. Voyager 1 explored Jupiter in 1979 and <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1980. The eruption is n't apparent in any single image of <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, but was `` recognized by examining several images taken from different angles and analyzed through stereoscopic techniques,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s eruptions are of nitrogen ice with nitrogen gas, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` It's a semantic issue'' whether to call them volcanoes or giant geysers, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` If we're talking about the materials involved, it's closer to a geyser than a volcano. But if you're talking about the mechanics involved _ shooting material miles above the surface _ that's closer to a volcano. Scientists do n't know what causes the eruptions on <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, the coldest known object in the solar system with a surface temperature of 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. `` One possibility being considered is that pressurized gas, probably nitrogen, rises from beneath the surface and carries aloft dark particles and possibly ice crystals,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Whatever the cause, the plume takes the particles to an altitude where they are left suspended to form a cloud that drifts.'' <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> is about four-fifths the size of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s moon. Voyager 2 also discovered gargantuan storms and 720-mph wind in <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s atmosphere, and six moons orbiting the planet in addition to <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> and Nereid, which were detected from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. It also discovered three thin rings and one broad band of dust orbiting the planet.

Two American military base workers were ambushed and killed by communist rebels in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> last Tuesda shortly before <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s arrival. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said a waiver of the restriction on using <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid for internal security would `` help protect American lives.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who returned Friday from a 12-day, four-nation Asian tour, was instrumental in obtaining a similar waiver for <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> earlier this year after he visited there. The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is due to receive almost $ 650 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid next year. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did not say how much he felt should be reallocated toward internal security, but aides said the country needs basic security equipment including two-way radios for police cars in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> to help combat terrorism. In a luncheon interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and other news organizations, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that a long-term agreement to keep the six American military installations in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> would make the country more attractive to foreign investors. `` The country needs economic development. You see that just upon arrival, traveling the streets of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. You still have poverty at a very significant degree,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` They need private investment. They need businesses to come over there and invest,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who also visited <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. The base agreement, covering <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> naval station and four smaller installations, expires in September 1991, and a dozen of the 23 members of the country's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> favor closing them. Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> has suggested a 5-to-10 year extension of the lease agreement. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he told <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> a 5-to-10 year agreement `` means we're leaving. I do n't believe that that is what you really want if you want to think of the long-term stability of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.'' `` That's the question the Filipinos have to ask themselves,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who reiterated that he believes `` the majority of the people ... still support our presence.'' `` I think we are a stabilizing force in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and stability is what investors and people look to.'' On other issues, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said: _ The Soviets should not misconstrue the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's continued support for a `` realistic'' Strategic Defense `` If they view a phased deployment and a redefinition of SDI as a lessening of the commitment, they're misreading the tea leaves.'' _ Shrugged off a question about his own low standing in public opinion polls `` I'm gratified for the president's good standing in polls. That's my concern right now. I got plenty of time to worry about my own,'' said the 44-year-old vice president. _ The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not support the `` puppet'' Cambodian government installed by the Vietnamese The main <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goal now in the wake of the Vietnamese troop pullout is supporting the non-communist resistance and trying to prevent the `` mass murderers'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from returning to power, he said. _ It will `` take time for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to recover'' following the government massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Tianamen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> `` The problem is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> continues to perceive that nothing happened, or whatever happened is nobody's business, and therefore it's for us to change, not them,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. That `` attitude'' must change, he added. _ All three <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> opposition leaders <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met with `` clearly support'' keeping the 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed there `` For us to pull the cord at this time would be very counterproductive,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who said democracy is clearly emerging in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> again goaded the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration Monday on its `` timidity'' in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and said the Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will press ahead with additional aid for the new non-communist government. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who met with top Polish officials last week, said the new government led by members of the Solidarity trade union is `` firmly committed'' to establishing a more Western-style economy. `` The only question is whether the West will make it possible for this transformation to succeed,'' he said in a floor speech. He noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has voiced support for new loans to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> through the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. But he said those moves alone will not meet the country's immediate needs. `` It appears the administration remains hesitant to move forward until <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic reforms already are fully in place,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. `` In light of our great stake in the success of the new Polish government, I believe this response is excessively timid.'' The comments were <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s fourth public attack on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> policy in two weeks `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will do its best to ensure that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does in fact play a leading role in encouraging the success of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s brave experiment,'' he said, pointing to a three-year $ 1.2 billion aid package passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that dwarfs <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s three-year, $ 119 million program of economic development aid. `` I call upon the administration to abandon its timidity and to take advantage of this historic opportunity to provide the kind of help that is necessary for democracy and open government to succeed in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 For the second straight month, Jewish emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reached an all-time high, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Soviet Jewry announced Monday. In September, 8,442 Jews left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, up from the previous monthly high set in August of 6,756 emigres. Before this year, the previous high was set in October 1979, when 4,746 emigrated. At the current rate of emigration, `` we are within sight of surpassing the benchmark year of 1979,'' when 51,320 Jews left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Strober </PERSON>, a spokesman for the conference. The cumulative total this year is 41,886.

 Victims or families of victims of foreign government-sponsored torture could sue for damages in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district courts under a bill passed Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Approved on a 362-4 vote, the legislation extends to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens who have been tortured abroad the same civil redress now available to foreign nationals tortured in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` This bill puts torturers on notice they will find no safe haven in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The first day of registration for February's national election went smoothly and about 30 percent of eligible voters signed up, a ranking international observer reported Monday. Spokesmen for an opposition coalition, however, accused the Sandinista government's electoral authorities of foot-dragging and said about half its own representatives were not given credentials to observe the registration. <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soraes </PERSON>, secretary-general of the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, described the complaints as `` administrative'' and said his organization's 52 observers throughout the country reported about 570,000 of an estimated 1.9 million eligible voters registered on Sunday, the first day. `` There was some -LRB- opposition -RRB- discussion of administrative aspects, for example the delay in accrediting representatives and the payment of the per diem, but ... everything proceeded normally,'' he told reporters Monday. `` I did not verify any obstacle or any complaint that could compromise the process.'' <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> visited 35 registration centers Sunday in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Granada </PERSON> and in two villages. Voters are permitted to register at 4,394 centers on the first four Sundays of October. General elections to be held Feb. 25 are for a president and vice president, mayors and a 90-member National Assembly. Publisher <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> coalition is challenging President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, who seeks another term as candidate of the ruling leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> party. Eight other parties are contesting the presidential election. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> called early elections as part of regional accords with the presidents of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> calling for demobilization of the Contras, U.S.-supported rebels fighting the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, spokesman for the opposition alliance, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> registration was slow and about half the opposition's representatives were not given credentials in time to help supervising the process. He said the alliance would file a formal complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Of seven Managua-area registration centers the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> visited Sunday, the coalition was represented at only two. Other opposition parties had observers at two of the remaining five and there were no opposition observers at three. Observers from the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> were present at all seven centers. An official said a registration center in <LOCATION> Chontales </LOCATION> province was moved `` to a safer place'' five miles away because of armed men in the area, presumably rebels. <PERSON> Ofiel </PERSON> <PERSON> Acuna </PERSON>, president of the regional election council, said the center was in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guarumo </LOCATION>, 100 miles east of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. There were no reports of Contra military activity on Sunday. Most of the rebels are in jungle camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, but a few Contra groups remain in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, including Chontales. A joint commission of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is charged with supervising the demobilization and re-integration of the Contras into civilian life. <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> said the necessary elements for fair elections appear to be present. `` Generally, I believe that on Feb. 25 there will be free and honest elections,'' he said. Thirty <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers watched the registration Sunday but did not comment.

 A federal judge acted within his powers by fining four <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, city councilmen for disobeying his desegregation order, a lawyer for the federal government told the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. But an attorney for the councilmen argued that the judge could have changed the city zoning ordinance, but chose instead to violate the councilmen's common-law right of legislative immunity, as well as their constitutionally protected freedom of speech. The case, argued before the high court Monday, is an outgrowth of the bitter, nine-year battle to desegregate <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>. The justices are expected to rule by July. The case centers around four city councilmen _ <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Longo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Chema </PERSON> and Vice Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON> _ who voted against a judge's order to pass a legislative package designed to lure subsidized housing to the city's white neighborhoods. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, the federal government's solicitor general, praised <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON> for not employing more stringent tactics to compel the councilmen to obey his July 26, 1988, order. In 1985, Sand found <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> that had for 40 years deliberately concentrated virtually all its subsidized housing in the southwest part of the city to keep blacks away from whites. Sand ordered the city to build 200 units of public housing in white neighborhoods in 1988 and to plan for 600 more. The city appealed, lost and seemed close to agreeing on a desegregation plan until <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> residents raised loud objections. The council defied Sand's order by voting 4-3 against the desegregation plan. Sand then set fines of $ 500 a day and threatened to jail the four unless they obeyed his order. `` They simply chose not to obey, and furthermore, they said, ` We do n't have to obey,''' <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> told the justices. Sand had also set fines for the city _ starting at $ 100 a day and doubling daily until they reached $ 1 million daily _ prompting Councilmen <PERSON> Chema </PERSON> and <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> to change their votes as <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> faced imminent bankruptcy. The councilmen ultimately paid $ 3,500 apiece in fines; none went to jail. <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> paid a total of $ 819,000 in fines, which were upheld by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the attorney representing the councilmen, argued Monday that the district court used `` the most intrusive means'' available to compel the four to change their votes, violating their legislative immunity. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> also argued that to vote is to exercise one's freedom of speech, which is protected by the First Amendment. `` Is this like the court ordering somebody to say something they do n't want to say?'' Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> at one point. `` Courts are always doing that.'' White gave the example of courts ordering employers to post notices they'd rather quash, and suggested <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> could make his argument without invoking the Constitution. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> also argued that there are limits to judicial authority, and that the councilmen were compelled to vote their consciences. This prompted Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to ask whether the councilmen had the right to force the city into bankruptcy. `` Yes, and to be held accountable for that at the ballot box,'' <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> said. The cases are <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-854; <PERSON> Chema </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-856; and <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-870.

<HEAD>Legislative Battle Builds Over Development in the Desert</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawmakers, miners, developers and environmentalists clashed Monday over legislation that would designate about 9.5 million acres of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> land as wilderness areas and national parks. `` We need to draw clear lines that development can work around while saving some lands as parks and wildernesses,'' Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., sponsor of the measure, told a crowded hearing conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on public lands, national parks and forests <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 enacted the Federal Land Policy and Management Act which established the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Desert Conservation Area. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, in accordance with the law, developed a management plan for the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> desert to balance the demands of environmentalists, hunters, miners, ranchers, energy developers, tourists and the military. But, according to <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> has `` failed to protect important desert resources.'' Citing a report by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> found that the bureau `` has frequently allowed the needs of competing interests, such as recreation and commercial use, to take precedence over wildlife interests when conflicts have arisen.'' The bureau disputed that charge. `` I wish the folks at <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> would have had both their eyes and ears open when they did their report,'' said <PERSON> Cy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamison </PERSON>, director of the bureau. `` <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s report presents only a partial picture of <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION>'s wildlife activities in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> desert.'' <PERSON> Jamison </PERSON> also criticized the legislation which appears driven by the premise that public lands will be destroyed if they are not designated as wilderness or placed in national parks. `` That is wrong and that mindset would gut the multiple use philosophy mandated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Jamison </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanregret </PERSON>, a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the legislation `` would destroy thousands of private businesses and would, literally, make thousands of citizens homeless.'' <PERSON> Sanregret </PERSON> argued the measure would lock out millions of acres of public land for future use by mineral exploration and development. Recreationists complained that the legislation would close off camping areas, hiking trails and rock collecting sites. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> had noted that the bureau proposes permitting a motorcycle race through a desert tortoise habitat during the Thanksgiving weekend next month. The state has listed the desert tortoise as an endangered species. The High <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattlemans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the legislation `` will directly affect the livelihoods of the ranchers, the future of desert ranching and the local economy.''

<HEAD>Court Agrees To Consider Use Of Undercover Agents To Gain Confessions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday agreed to consider allowing the use of police undercover agents to elicit confessions from jailed criminal suspects. The justices announced they will use the the case of an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> murder suspect to consider weakening its famous 1966 Miranda ruling that requires police to warn suspects of their right to an attorney and to remain silent. An <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> appeals court ruled last November that police violated the rights of <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> when they planted an undercover agent in jail to question him about a murder. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> was charged with fatally shooting <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> on Nov. 8, 1984, in <LOCATION> Fairview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>. Police lacked a suspect in the murder in 1986 when <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON>, an inmate at <ORGANIZATION> Graham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hillsboro </LOCATION>, told authorities he had information about the homicide. Police then placed <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> and undercover narcotics officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> on March 31, 1986. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> was being held there awaiting trial on a charge of aggravated battery unrelated to the murder. <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON>, using the alias <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>, wore motorcycle garb and told <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> he was interested in planning an escape. <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> arranged to meet in the cellbock after the other inmates went to sleep. At that meeting <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> whether he had ever `` done someone,'' a phrase the appeals court said was intended to elicit information about any killings in which <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> took part. The appeals court said <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> then recounted in detail the killing of <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> then was taken to the county courthouse, placed under arrest for murder and given his Miranda warnings. A state judge in 1987 ruled that <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>' jailhouse statements to <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON> about the <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> killing could not be admitted as evidence. State officials, seeking to have the statements admitted, said the Miranda ruling is designed to protect suspects against police coercion. The officials said since <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> had engaged in friendly conversation pretending to enlist <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> in a jailbreak, there could be no coercion. But the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> appeals court said the Miranda ruling applies whenever a suspect is in custody, `` even when the purpose of the custody is unrelated to the purpose of the interrogation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 ruled that law enforcement officials can not hire jailhouse informants to induce criminal defendants in custody to make incriminating statements. The justices in that ruling relied on their own 1964 decision _ handed down two years before <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> _ that barred government agents from eliciting incriminating information from defendants entitled to a lawyer's help during interrogation. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> officials said the 1980 high court ruling permits <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON>'s questioning of <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> because no murder charges against <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> had been filed. Under such circumstances, the state said, `` there exists no inherent danger that a suspect will believe he has no choice but to submit to -LRB- police -RRB- will and to confess.'' The case is <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, 88-1972.

<HEAD>Supreme Court to Review Federal Crime Victims Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed Monday to review a law requiring people convicted of federal crimes to pay money to help crime victims. The court said it will study a ruling that the law is unconstitutional because it is a revenue-raising measure that originated in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rather than the House of Representatives. The Constitution requires that revenue-raising measures start in the House. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is seeking to have the appeals court ruling reversed. The case stems from a $ 50 `` assessment'' against German Munoz-Flores, convicted of helping an illegal alien evade inspection by immigration officials in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Munoz-Flores </PERSON> also was placed on probation for two years The assessment was ordered under a 1984 law aimed at raising money to offset the cost of helping victims of crimes. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last December that the law is a revenue-raising measure that should have originated in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rather than the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The appeals court's ruling is binding in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said the ruling invalidates assessments imposed against thousands of people convicted in those states. The government's appeal said that the 9th Circuit's ruling, if adopted nationwide, would affect tens of thousands of criminal cases each year. Government lawyers argued that the 1984 law is not primarily designed to raise revenue, but rather was part of a package to help crime victims. The lawyers also said the assessments measure is designed in part to punish those convicted of crimes.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> does not intend to alter his <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> peace plan despite pressure from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the rival <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, his aides said Monday. `` Only five months have passed'' since <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> presented his plan for elections as a first step toward negotiations and `` the prime minister does not see any reason to change it,'' spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said. Egyptian, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s governing coalition _ <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s rightist <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ is preparing to debate <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s efforts to bring Palestinians and <LOCATION> Israelis </LOCATION> together in preliminary talks. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasim </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and others to persuade <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and move `` out of the circle of violence and oppression ... into a state of security, stability and constructiveness.'' The Cabinet leadership, including <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor ministers, is to meet Thursday about <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s ideas. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> rejects a formula backed by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that involves trading occupied land for peace and including people deported by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> negotiating delegation. Labor, led by Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, supports both ideas. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposed elections would choose delegates to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> about interim autonomy in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> raised the land-for-peace proposal after many Palestinians dismissed <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan as an effort to end the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation that began Dec. 8, 1987. At <LOCATION> Tammun </LOCATION> village in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mahmud </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bani </PERSON> <PERSON> Awde </PERSON>, 22, was stabbed to death Monday for reasons not immediately clear. The Israeli army said the killing was a family matter and was under police investigation, but the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said <PERSON> Awde </PERSON> belonged to the Democratic Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a Marxist group, and the murder may have been political. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, a soldier was slightly injured Monday by a rock thrown by Palestinians in the Jabaliya refugee camp, the army said. Elsewhere in the occupied lands, Arab hospital officials reported 11 Palestinians wounded by army gunfire, including a 15-year-old boy hospitalized in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with a critical head wound. Shops in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> closed Monday to protest the shooting deaths of two Palestinians youths the previous day, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers or civilians have killed at least 581 Palestinians in the uprising, and 123 Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs, most as suspected collaborators with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Forty Israelis have died in the violence. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Friday to talk about his proposals. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> issued a veiled threat to drop support for the election plan unless <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> moved toward the proposals made by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the only <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> country to have made peace with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said last week the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would `` have to go back to the drawing board'' on plans for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rejected <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s ideas. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, another <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aide, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> did not see <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s comment as a threat but added that the government would not bow to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure `` Everybody knows you ca n't twist <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s arm when you want to get something,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Aharon </PERSON>, director of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s office, said including deported Palestinians in a negotiating team was a ploy to sneak the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> defines as a terrorist group, into the peace process. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, noted that <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> did not mention two Arab demands <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has found most objectionable: a direct role for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. He criticized what he called <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s effort to create `` a new Palestinian people'' who agreed with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on all points. `` The opinions of the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, the sentiments of the Palestinians ... must be known not only by every Israeli, but to every Israeli politician,'' he said on television. `` We must negotiate with people who do not agree with us.''

<TEXT>
 A flood of potent Mexican black tar heroin washed across <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> over the weekend, killing three users and sending dozens to hospitals with injuries ranging from broken bones to brain damage. `` Black tar heroin is pretty potent stuff anyway,'' said police Inspector <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>. He said the drug normally sold on the street is 5 to 9 percent pure. `` What we think is somebody forgot to cut it somewhere along the line.'' Between Friday and Monday morning, three people died in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and 54 others were treated for overdoses after they shot up the gooey black drug. Some users were unconscious and unable to breathe when reached by paramedics who administered an antidote called Nalaxone. Overdose cases were reaching <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> and a few private hospitals at the rate of one an hour, compared with the usual heroin overdose rate of one or two a day, authorities said. The fatalities were said to be men aged 35, 41 and 43. The coroner's office was not releasing their names on Monday. At the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic, Medical Director Dr. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalcup </PERSON> said the latest overdoses were the worst since a `` similar wave of overdoses and deaths'' in March 1987 that involved black tar mixed with fentanyl, a pharmaceutical compound that can be 1,000 times more powerful than heroin. It is used by anesthesiologists and redirected illicitly. <PERSON> Stalcup </PERSON> speculated that the same thing may have happened in the recent overdoses. Introduction of fentanyl into the drug scene several years ago resulted in a sudden rash of even more deaths, he said. Today it's often mixed with an adulterant and sold as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> White, he added. Black tar has become the most commonly used heroin by <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s estimated 15,000 to 18,000 addicts since coming on the scene about seven years ago, <PERSON> Stalcup </PERSON> said. It sells for about $ 20 a bag that can be broken into several shots. <PERSON> Stalcup </PERSON> attributed its popularity to the ease of bringing it into the country in `` body pack'' _ bags attached to one's body _ compared with the difficulties of smuggling so-called <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> White from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. A 35-year-old musician who spoke with The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> while recovering at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> said he uses heroin about once a week. `` It hit me good. Real good,'' he said. `` I remember telling my friends that it almost was too good. I sat back to enjoy it and just nodded off. Next thing I was waking up here.'' While <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> police pursued leads from overdose victims, <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> police seized 4 pounds of black tar heroin worth about $ 2 million, and arrested five people in their largest heroin bust in more than 10 years. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents seized 2 kilos of black tar heroin at hotels near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Heiress' Claim for Return of $5.5 million Upheld</HEAD>
<HEAD>Wth AM-Supreme Court Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LENOX, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An heiress who donated $ 6.5 million to an evangelical <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> group won a battle to recover most of the money Monday when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to hear the group's appeal of an order to repay her. `` I'm thrilled,'' said department store heiress <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>. `` I think this decision shows that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> does not protect bogus preachers.'' The court, without comment, let stand rulings that the group, The Bible Speaks, received the donations after exerting undue influence on Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>. `` A lot of aspects of it are n't over yet, but this was the biggest part,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON> joined The Bible Speaks in 1982. Within three years, she donated more than $ 6.5 million _ including contributions of $ 5 million, $ 1 million and $ 500,000. Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>' family in late 1985 hired two `` deprogrammers'' to talk to her. She later left The Bible Speaks, and sued to have her gifts returned. The case was first heard in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court after the church petitioned for Chapter 11 protection maintaining that Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>' lawsuit could force it into insolvency. A judge ruled in her behalf and a trustee was appointed. The 1st U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld her claim to only $ 5.5 million, saying the other $ 1 million had been donated in good faith. The appeal acted on Monday challenged only that portion of the appeals court decision concerning the $ 5 million in gifts. At issue was whether allowing Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON> to rescind her gifts violated the The Bible Speaks' religious freedom. Attorneys for The Bible Speaks had argued that Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>' money was used for the purposes she specified, including the construction of a new chapel, a swimming pool and other improvements at the church's headquarters They maintained the lower court rulings threaten all religious groups. `` But they are of especially grave concern to evangelical and fundamentalist religious communities.'' Church leaders have since abandoned the former prep school in <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION> that had served as the church's headquarters. The former pastor now works in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> for a group called `` The Greater Grace.'' `` I am very disappointed that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has chosen not to grant our petition to hear this case. There were many issues involved that should have been addressed, and now they will obviously go unanswered,'' <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, founder of both groups, said in a statement issued through a spokesman. Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>, who acquired the <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION> headquarters at a bankruptcy auction for a fraction of her claim while the case was under appeal, said she now plans to sell the property. Mrs. <PERSON> Dovydenas </PERSON>, an heir to the <ORGANIZATION> Dayton-Hudson </ORGANIZATION> fortune, grew up in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Some years ago, after moving to <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION> in 1981 with her husband, she assessed her personal wealth at about $ 19 million.

<HEAD>Hungary Rejects Reported Romanian Proposal to Intervene in Poland</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has rejected a proposal by Romanian President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> for <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact intervention to prevent formation of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new government led by non-Communists, an official said Monday. <PERSON> Geza </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotai </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s secretary in charge of international affairs, made the remark in an interview with the party newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION>. He was confirming reports published in a Polish newspaper that said the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had received such a proposal from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. A pro-Solidarity Polish newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION>, published articles Friday saying <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> had summoned the Polish ambassador in August to complain about the planned formation of a Solidarity-led government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. It said <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> had decided to turn to the leaders of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact to `` jointly act in favor of preventing a serious situation in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, in favor of defending socialism and the Polish nation.'' The report did not say if <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> had made such an appeal to other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>, a seven-nation military alliance led by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Kotai </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had received a call for intervention `` and we gave a definite rejection.'' <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Kotai </PERSON> as saying, `` In present day <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the fate of a nation is decided by the majority of the society in that country, and not by a single party'' Last month, Solidarity journalist <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> became the leader of the Polish government _ the first non-Communist prime minister in the Soviet bloc. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, among the most liberal in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, has agreed to hold free elections by June and has said it would surrender power if it loses and join the opposition. `` We categorically reject the idea of any interference here, and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Treaty can give no grounds for such action,'' <PERSON> Kotai </PERSON> told the newspaper. At recent <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact meetings, the members expressed the stand of non-interference in each others' internal affairs.

 A West German diplomat rescued an East German grabbed by a policeman Monday as he tried to scale a fence into <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s mission. However, most Czechoslovak police relaxed their controls, letting hundreds more refugees enter the compound as a new diplomatic dispute built up over the issue. East German refugees inside the embassy said they numbered more than 2,000 by late Monday and more than 100 additional refugees were arriving hourly. In a formal protest delivered to West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s office, East German envoy <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Neubauer </PERSON> said his government demanded that the new refugees be `` turned out of the embassy and returned to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' The latest rush came after 7,000 East Germans were allowed to leave West German embassies in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> over the weekend for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. More than 32,000 East Germans have arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since Sept. 10, when <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> opened its western border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and the numbers of refugees occupying <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s embassies swelled. On Monday, both <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of breaking its word by harboring new refugees, going back on conditions it agreed to in gaining release of the earlier refugee throng. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> denied any such agreement. And <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothen </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, insisted <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` never told the East Germans it would stop taking in East Germans seeking refuge.'' West German officials said they would press <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to let the new arrivals leave for the West. Czechoslovak police continued patrols outside the embassy Monday but relaxed controls on pedestrians and drivers, witnesses reported. Nearly 10,000 people marched through <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, on Monday, demanding legalization of opposition groups and adoption of democratic reforms. It was the largest mass opposition demonstration since 1953, when workers rose throughout <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in an ill-fated uprising later crushed by Soviet tanks. In <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, an estimated 100-200 refugees had arrived at the West German Embassy. About 800 left the embassy Sunday for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> officials said Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was instrumental in winning the release of East German refugees and that Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was in touch with <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> on the matter. East German opposition groups criticized their government's approval of the exodus, declaring in a statement that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was `` losing a village every day. It said reforms were the only `` reasonable'' solution. More than 120,000 East Germans have reached <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> so far this year, including those who left legally and illegally. Police at the embassy in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> were alternately harsh and lenient. An East German man about 30 years old was seen climbing the fence to the embassy. A policeman hung on, exerting all his weight to bring the climber down. Refugees inside the fence clung to the man and shouted for help. A diplomat ran outside the fence and put his arm around the refugee. They walked away, ringed by police and reporters. A policeman pointed to an East German handcuffed to a park bench. The diplomat arranged for the East German to be freed, then led both men into the embassy. Refugees said Czechoslovak officers patrolled the embassy area with dogs during the night. A 26-year-old woman said she, her child and her husband were dragged away from the embassy fence during the night, kicked and beaten by police. Later, she said, three other policemen helped the family and showed them the way to the mission's entrance, where they and others were admitted. Some refugees said East Germans caught by police were detained, then released elsewhere. Inside the embassy garden, studded with tents that sheltered those who left over the weekend, refugees got assistance for newcomers and helped others over the fence, witnesses reported. More East Germans, however, were reported crossing the border from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to communist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and entering <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s official news agency, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>, said 2,880 people entered <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> over the weekend, most of them East Germans. It said 24 people swam the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> between <PERSON> Rajka </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Esztergom </LOCATION> to cross into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Newly arrived East Germans at the <LOCATION> Giessen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, refugee reception center said Monday they had been prepared to stay indefinitely in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s mud-filled embassy in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> rather than return home. `` I would have never gone back to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, this was it,'' said <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, a railway worker from <LOCATION> Magdeburg </LOCATION> who spent eight days in a tent with his wife and teen-age son. He said the family never applied for permission to emigrate legally because certain harassment would follow. `` You can lose your job ... Once you apply, you will be interrogated by the security police, and soon you can drop out of sight,'' <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillert </PERSON> said he was demoted from chief doctor in a hospital near <LOCATION> Magdeburg </LOCATION> after applying to leave five years ago and his son, an excellent scholar, was rejected when he tried to enter a university. `` The officials made no secret of the reason _ they told us in writing it was because we wanted to emigrate,'' <PERSON> Gillert </PERSON> said. Several refugees at the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> emphasized their material situation was quite good in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but their lives were constricted. `` I am not poor,'' said a 24-year-old civil engineer, who spoke on conditoin of anonymity. `` But I have no future. We see no chance for change. We have no trouble with eating and drinking, but we have our limits.''

 Converting an abandoned, 28-building factory into a $ 77.5 million contemporary art museum could revitalize this remote milltown, consultants said Monday. A commission is working on such a museum, but critics question whether art lovers would drive to <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> _ three hours northwest of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, four hours from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ for the stark enticements of contemporary art. Backers of the so-called <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> want to use a plant complex abandoned in 1984 by the town's largest employer, <ORGANIZATION> Sprague </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> They want to convert the vast, grimy plant into rooms of unique environmental works or sculptures. Sprague employed more than 1,000 people before relocating to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. A draft of the consultants' feasibility study projects the museum could employ 640 people in the town of 16,000 people where unemployment is about 4 percent. Consultants hired by the commission project as many as 150,000 people would visit the museum in a year, pumping $ 22 million into the region's economy. `` The sheer reality of marketing this museum will depend in a certain extent to a creative approach,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bidwell </PERSON>, one of the consultants. The idea of turning the complex of 28 buildings into 350,000 square feet of gallery space was devised by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Krens </PERSON>, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Berkshires </LOCATION>. Shortly after launching the project, <PERSON> Krens </PERSON> was named director of the <ORGANIZATION> Guggenheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Plans for the museum call for an accompanying restaurant and luxury condominiums selling at $ 160,000 to $ 250,000. `` The project will work,'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonz </PERSON>, another of the consultants, told the commission Monday during review of the draft study. The commission is looking for $ 35 million from the state, spread over four or five years. The remaining $ 44.5 million would come from private donations. Members of the commission did not take final action on feasibility of the project. They endorsed the draft study and scheduled a presentation to the state Dec. 11.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> found `` glaring disparities'' etween the state's rich and poor school districts and ruled Monday that funding within the nation's second-largest system is unconstitutional. Spending varies by as much as $ 17,000 per pupil per year from rich to poor districts, the court found. `` A remedy is long overdue,'' Justice <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauzy </PERSON>'s opinion said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> must take immediate action.'' The 9-0 ruling could have enormous financial and social implications for the 3.3 million-student <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> school system, second in size to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s. The court found the public school finance system violates the 113-year-old constitutional provision for an `` efficient system'' of public schools. It set a May 1, 1990, deadline for legislators to find a solution. State attorneys had argued that the word `` efficient'' was intended to suggest a ` simple and inexpensive system.''' But the court said, `` The state's school financing system is neither financially efficient, nor efficient in the sense of providing for a ` general diffusion of knowledge' statewide. `` It must be recognized that the constitution requires an ` efficient,' not an ` economical,' ` inexpensive,' or ` cheap' system,'' <PERSON> Mauzy </PERSON> said `` A Band-Aid will not suffice; the system itself must be changed,'' the court warned. Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> said he will call for a special 30-day session of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in the spring. Nearly $ 10 billion in state money will be made available for public schools in 1990-91, and almost $ 12 billion is expected to come from local districts. A state district judge in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> ruled the school funding system was unconstitutional in a case brought by school districts with low property values against the state education commissioner and others. That ruling was overturned last December by a 2-1 vote of the Austin-based <ORGANIZATION> 3rd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The lawsuit, known as <LOCATION> Edgewood </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>, was filed in 1984. Public schools are funded largely through a combination of local property taxes and state aid. The federal government also contributes. Because of the disparities in district property wealth, annual spending per student ranges from $ 2,112 to $ 19,333, the high court said without placing an exact date for the figures. The case got its title from the lead plaintiff, <ORGANIZATION> Edgewood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, and lead defendant, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>, education commissioner. Edgewood Superintendent <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> led about 1,800 students and teachers in a celebration rally Monday. The high school's marching band played and students waved banners with sayings like `` Victory'' and `` Edgewood All the Way. A marquee at the stadium's entrance read `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Children 9, <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> 0.'' `` Today we can begin to say we're no longer the <LOCATION> poorest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> school </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ we're the toughest,'' <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> told cheering students and teachers. `` We took on the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and we beat'em.'' Also attending the gathering was <PERSON> Demetrio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who launched the fight for equal school funding in 1968 when he and other <LOCATION> Edgewood </LOCATION> parents filed a lawsuit that reached the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1973 but was defeated. `` This is a big day for me and my family,'' said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who has four children who graduated from the <LOCATION> Edgewood </LOCATION> district and one who is a high school senior. `` I cried this morning because it really is something that has been in my heart,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said, his voice cracking with emotion. In <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, education commissioner <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> said, `` As the lead defendant in this case, I have been required to defend the constitutionality of the system. But I have always maintained that it is not adequate and have pressed for additional amounts of money to improve equity. `` Now that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has ruled the system unconstitutional, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> must create a system that is constitutional and that provides adequate funding to ensure a high quality education for all children in the state,'' <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> `` Ollie'' <PERSON> Besteiro </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` History will mark this day as the opening of the door to opportunity for tens of thousands, even millions, of children. `` These children have been the victims of ` segregated' opportunity determined by a geographical roll of the dice. Similar rulings have been issued in other states. The <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in June ordered an overhaul of that state's schools.

<TEXT>
 The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> abandoned its controversial policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament Monday, overturning the vote-losing doctrine at its annual conference. It also approved a motion urging <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to begin a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and called the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> a `` just revolt.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it describes as a terrorist group bent on destroying the Jewish state. The motion said that, since <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the territories in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, `` the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military occupation has prevented the Palestinians from living under their own chosen form of government and enjoying civil and political rights.'' Delegates reaffirmed previous party positions backing the right of both Palestinians and Israelis to states with internationally recognized borders and calling the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> the only legitimate representative of the Palestinians. It referred to the 21-month-old uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> as `` the just revolt of the Palestinian people calling for an end to the ` iron fist' policy of the Israeli military ... and a withdrawal from the occupied territories.'' After sometimes heated debate, delegates voted for a policy that commits a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government to give up <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s nuclear arsenal only as part of a negotiated arms deal. Dismayed left wingers hung peace symbols from balconies in the conference hall as speakers warned that the socialist movement must change or suffer a fourth successive election defeat by Conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. `` It puts us in a very strong position to argue for an effective and realistic initiative and to get verifiable -LRB- nuclear arms -RRB- agreements,'' party leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> said after the vote on the first full day of the weeklong conference. Delegates at the convention in this south <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> resort cast votes totaling 3.6 million to 2.4 million to ditch unilateral nuclear disarmament after leaders of big, moderate trade unions swung behind <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>. There are 1,500 conference delegates but the votes are counted in the millions because the leaders of trade union that control 90 percent of the voting power cast blocks of tens of thousands of votes based on the memberships of their unions. In a victory for party leftists, the conference voted by a 4-2 margin for a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> government to cut defense expenditures by one-fourth, bringing it in line with the average in other West European members of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. Under the new policy, a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> government would retain <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s submarine-launched Polaris nuclear missiles It would also stick to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s decision to replace them in the early 1990s with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trident missiles, which are nine times more powerful than Polaris missiles. Legislator <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Benn </PERSON>, a former energy secretary and doyen of the Labor left, accused the party of betraying `` the basis of our whole policy.'' `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> does not need nuclear weapons. There is no Soviet nuclear threat. That is the challenge we can not ignore,'' declared <PERSON> Benn </PERSON> to cheers from sections of the conference hall. A succession of speakers cited strides in superpower arms control negotiations since Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> s. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took office, and they said a new Labor policy suited the improved East-West relations. But others argued simply that <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> must change to win. `` We know it is the policy which is at fault, not the presentation,'' said delegate <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Heal </PERSON>. `` The leadership has been accused of betrayal. But the people who will be guilty of betrayal are those who by their actions ensure <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s return for another term.'' Labor adopted its policy on nuclear weapons in 1981 as the party lurched left after losing power to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> two years previously. Polls show the policy was a major factor in Labor's two subsequent defeats by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> in 1983 and 1987. She must call the next election by mid-1992. Dropping the non-nuclear doctrine was part of a major new policy platform aimed at shifting the party toward the center. The conference is to vote on the changes, the result of a two-year review, through the week.

 The Sony Walkman, the <ORGANIZATION> Dictaphone </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> coffeemaker were successful industrial designs that are the focus of designers gathered to look for an edge on products of the future. Those products succeeded because their companies took their industrial designers seriously, said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Design </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>, which is conducting a four-day symposium with the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Most business managers say they use engineers or others to create a product, and `` then get the flakes to get the color picked out,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, one of those `` flakes'' by training, said designers can be the consumer's advocate inside the firm, choosing the right size knobs and switches that can make a product work easily or not. <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which had an electronic saxaphone in the exhibit, used its designers to find a modern shape that would match the new technology of digital wind music. The first design was described by one <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION> worker as a `` snake that ate a lunch box.'' Several versions later, the final product resembles a futuristic rifle. Embellished with the standard finger pads in black, the instrument is a long black tube, bent down at one end for the mouthpiece. The sound that emerges from the instrument can range from synthesized voices to the acoustic timbres of wind instruments. The product dominates the professional wind digital music market, according to <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION>. Designers at AB Bahco Vertyg, the tools division of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bahco </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, helped the company maintain its share in the screwdriver market, while increasing its profit margin by 20 percent, said <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. The company had discovered in market research that carpenters use a two-handed grip 70 percent of the time, and gave the problem to its designers. The new screwdriver, which was presented at the exhibit, is shaped like the numeral 8, with textured polypropylene where the handle widens. At <LOCATION> Braun </LOCATION>, business managers faced the problem of an extremely low share of the coffeemaker market. The KF20 model, introduced in 1972, had won awards for its simple, cylindrical design, but it was too expensive. `` Artists and designers would collect our things to add to their collections, but we were not succesful,'' said <PERSON> Dieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rems </PERSON>, the company's chief designer, who spoke at the symposium Monday. The solution, which included cheaper materials and fewer parts, may not seem that innovative at first glance. But Rems said the new design, marketed as the KF40, used one heater for both coffee and water instead of two, which cut the price dramatically. More than 2.5 million units of the new design sold in 1988, giving <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> a 12 percent market share. The company makes 12,000 units a day. Rems said having the designers talk to the manufacturers was a crucial element in the <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> story, because the design could be adapted to cut production costs. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said he thinks if American businesses adopted more of these tactics, the competitiveness of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products would improve vastly. Designers are still supposed to pick the right color, though. Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> wanted its new educational toy, a headset computer, to appeal to both boys and girls. But the company's research showed that boys liked black headsets and girls liked lavender, and each sex hated the other's top choice. The result is a grand compromise: a slate-gray headset with cushioning foam done in purple, yellow, blue, green and magenta.

 Violinist <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON>, whose skills won him international acclaim, was placed on probation Monday after being indicted on cocaine and heroin charges. `` Of course I'm relieved that this ordeal is over,'' <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> said. `` The experience has been a frightening and profound one. What I want to do now is get back to my music and my life.'' <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty to breaking into a <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard motel room where he was discovered July 27. A search of the room found a bottle containing more than 20 grams of cocaine, a hypodermic needle with a small amount of heroin and a dagger. A Dukes County Grand Jury on Monday morning returned indictments of breaking and entering, possession of heroin and cocaine and possession of instruments used to administer drugs. After lawyers on both sides conferred, <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> pleaded guilty to the breaking and entering charge, which carried a maximum penalty of six months in jail. Judge <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> to three years probation, during which he must continue a drug treatment program and submit to random drug testing. <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> pleaded innocent to the other charges, and they were placed on file, pending his completion of probation. `` This should n't have been treated as a serious criminal matter and it was n't,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> has been to a treatment center and has turned his life around.'' Born in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> began playing violin at age 8. He has performed at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where in 1974 he became the first American medalist at the Tchaikovsky Violin Competition. After <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON>'s arrest, family members and colleagues said his drug use had begun recently, after he had trouble building on his early celebrity. `` This was a very important experience actually in his life,'' <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> said. `` He was feeling down in the dumps and he turned toward drugs.'' <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fodor </PERSON> has undergone seven weeks of treatment, and couselors say his progress has been good and they are confident he can remain drug free.

 <PERSON> Witold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowicki </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> and its conductor for nearly 25 years, has died, the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Monday. He was 75. The agency said <PERSON> Rowicki </PERSON> died Sunday but did not give the cause of death or say where he died. <PERSON> Rowicki </PERSON> had remained active as a guest conductor since leaving the National Philharmonic in 1977. He was `` one of the artists whose art has brought the greatest fame to Polish musical culture,'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Rowicki </PERSON> had conducted major orchestras on five continents. He was born Feb. 26, 1914, in <LOCATION> Taganrog </LOCATION>, now part of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and graduated in 1938 from the <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> Music Conservatory, where he became the professor of the violin class. During the Nazi occupation, <PERSON> Rowicki </PERSON> was a member of the symphony orchestra in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, playing violin and viola. After the war in 1945, under the new Communist regime, he became head of the music section of Polish Radio in <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. There he founded the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, now the <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. In 1950, <PERSON> Rowicki </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and founded the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION> in the capital that was rebuilding from World War II. Except for a three-year leave in the mid-1950s, he served as its artistic director and first conductor until relinquishing the position in 1977. When the war-ravaged <PERSON> Wielki </PERSON> <PERSON> Teatr </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s opulent opera, ballet and concert hall, was finally restored in 1965, <PERSON> Rowicki </PERSON> conducted the premier performance, featuring the opera `` The Haunted House'' by Polish composer <PERSON> Moniuszko </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> will not take part in a key <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case over abortion rights to be decided during the 1989-90 term, a court spokeswoman said Monday. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> had not disqualified himself when the justices agreed last July 3 to review the case, one of three abortion disputes before the high court this term. But a minor court order issued in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case Monday noted that <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> did not participate. Asked about that, court spokeswoman <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> said the justice had disqualified himself from the case for unstated reasons. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was one of four dissenters from the court's decision last July letting states make abortions harder to get. He has provided a consistent vote in support of the 1973 court decision that women have a constitutional right to abortion. The <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case focuses on a state law that would require abortion clinics to add services and equipment now found only in hospitals. The law could force many clinics to close down, and could add up to $ 50 to the cost of an abortion performed in the first three months of pregnancy. In invalidating the law, lower courts said it violated a portion of the 1973 ruling in <LOCATION> Roe </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> that limited state regulation over first-trimester abortions. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> officials are not asking the justices to use the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case to reverse <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, but legal experts say the court's ruling could chip away at the trimester-by-trimester approach taken in the 1973 decision.

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> testified Monday at his fraud trial that he and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, accepted $ 3.1 million in bonuses while the ministry's finances foundered. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board members granted the bonuses `` of their own free will'' and often told him, `` I was worth much more than this, and they would say that over and over again.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> left the witness stand Monday, completing 10 hours of testimony that began Friday. Both sides rested their cases Monday, with closing arguments scheduled for Tuesday. The case could go to the jury as early as Wednesday. The disgraced television evangelist testified that he raised more than $ 425 million for <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> from 1984 to 1987, when he and his wife received $ 3.1 million in bonuses. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was asked by his lawyer, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, what he did with the $ 425 million. `` I put it to the work of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>,'' he said. During defense questioning, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> summed up his defense: `` We were a church, and people always wanted to run it like a business. I had to keep telling them, this was a church, not a business.'' As <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> left court during a break, he was smiling, saying, `` I feel fine.'' He turned to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and said, `` This is a nice place to visit but I did n't plan to live here.'' In other testimony, M.C. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, the trustee overseeing the ministry's property since it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors, testified <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> was $ 50 million in debt and had $ 160 million in claims against it from `` lifetime partners'' when <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned in March 1987. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, 49, is charged with 15 counts of wire fraud, eight counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is accused of diverting more than $ 3.7 million in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money for his own benefit and of conspiring to defraud <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> followers to support his lifestyle. If convicted, he faces up to 120 years in prison and more than $ 5 million in fines. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s former executive vice president, was sentenced Aug. 24 to eight years in prison and fined $ 200,000 under a plea bargain. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud and one count each of mail fraud and conspiracy and testified against <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. At the heart of the government's case is the charge that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> failed to live up to his promises of providing lodging at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> facilities for nearly 153,000 `` partners,'' people who sent in gifts of $ 1,000 or more. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is accused of diverting money from $ 158 million in contributions solicited to build lodging for donors. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> testified Friday that based on his own calculations he could accommodate more than 211,000 partners. `` Your long list -LRB- of available lodging -RRB- for the partners is really a recent fabrication you prepared for this trial?'' special prosecutor <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. `` That's a lie,'' he responded. <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, a supervisor at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s Heritage Grand Hotel, testified she had to turn away thousands of guests each month because there was no room for them. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> failed to tell <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board members about the ministry's money problems. `` I do n't know how the board members could not be aware of the financial crisis at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> testified. `` They knew we had cash flow problems and they voted to borrow funds to pay for them.'' Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> if he was contradicting testimony from six board members who said they did n't know about the ministry's financial problems `` I would tell them we were in great financial need. They were always up to date on all the financial information,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` I gave them the information to the best of my ability.'' But <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> later acknowledged he may have painted a rosy picture of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s finances to fellow board members. `` I was a minister,'' he said. `` I did my best to keep them informed and I know I was positive in the face of turmoil at times. I preached faith.''

 Friends and foes of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Monday mourned the death in a traffic accident of <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, the party's presidential nominee in 1988 elections. The charismatic, 55-year-old <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, who ran against President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, was killed on Sunday while campaigning for local candidates in his home state of <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> in the northwest. He was considered an architect of pragmatic, business-oriented politics within National Action. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on his first official visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, called <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>'s death `` very lamentable,'' describing him as a Mexican `` who sought to promote the good of the country,'' the government news service <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> said. Newspapers lauded <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>'s efforts to increase democracy in the country, which has been dominated by <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for 60 years. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> registered just over 50 percent of the vote to <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>'s 17 percent in an election <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> described as `` filthy.'' <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, who finished second to <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> with 31 percent of the vote, on Monday sent his `` condolences for the tragic death of a man who loved his country and set an example for his party members.'' <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>'s coalition of followers formed a new leftist party following the presidential contest in July 1988. <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>'s death came two weeks after his party celebrated its 50th anniversary and three months after <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> won its first victory in a governor's election in <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffo </PERSON>, the first opposition governor-elect in 60 years, left the <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> state capital of <LOCATION> Mexicali </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> state as soon as he heard of <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvo </PERSON> <PERSON> Manriquez </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>'s president in <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION>, was killed with <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> when their vehicle crossed a highway lane divider and ran into a heavy truck transporting papayas and bananas.

Funeral services were scheduled for Tuesday. <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Leticia </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, and 10 children.

 A ferry traveling between <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> capsized while crossing the turbulent <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on Monday and five people drowned, officials reported. Up to 10 people were reported missing.

But the independent news agency <ORGANIZATION> Diarios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> y </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION> reported later that there was no collision. No reason for the accident was given. However, the news agency said the ferry was designed to carry only 12 people.

<HEAD>U.S. Stakes Hopes on `More Constructive Soviet Role' in Indochina</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Monday more fighting might occur in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> hopes `` a more constructive Soviet role'' could help revive the stalled <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> peace process and avert civil war. `` Unfortunately, there is a prospect of more fighting'' in the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> country,'' Deputy Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambertson </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations subcommittee. But `` we hope it is not prolonged'' since the failed peace conference at <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in August `` was not the final chapter,'' <PERSON> Lambertson </PERSON> said. `` Vietnamese intransigence'' at that conference is one reason the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes it is premature to normalize relations with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and will try to maintain the diplomatic and economic isolation of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lambertson </PERSON> said. `` In the current situation we plan to steadfastly maintain our support for the diplomatic and economic isolation of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> as a reminder ... that attempts to manipulate international opinion will not provide a real basis for improved relations with other countries,'' <PERSON> Lambertson </PERSON> said. He testified as critics of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> policy warned of a `` fourth Indochina War'' in the current dry season and attacked U.S.-backed Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s alliance with the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, blamed for more than 1 million Cambodian deaths during the regime's 1975-78 rule over the country. <PERSON> Dith </PERSON> <PERSON> Pran </PERSON>, the Cambodian-born photographer whose escape from the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> was portrayed in the motion picture `` The Killing Fields,'' said the breakdown at <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> means that `` Cambodians are being forced by their leaders to go to the killing fields again.'' <PERSON> Pran </PERSON> said international pressure is needed to force the Cambodian factions back to the negotiating table. At <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the Soviets were `` frankly, quite passive'' about pressing for compromise on the part of their ally, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s Vietnam-backed Cambodian government, <PERSON> Lambertson </PERSON> said. But he said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is encouraged by subsequent `` useful discussions about <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'' between Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> at their recent meetings in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> blames collapse of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> conference on the refusal of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> to agree to share power with <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> in an interim Cambodian government. ` We will continue to work on resolving the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict with the Soviets in the context of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the continuing <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> conference process and on a bilateral basis,'' <PERSON> Lambertson </PERSON> said. `` We hope these discussions will result in a more constructive Soviet role in this process.'' He said the two superpowers have agreed on the need for a political settlement `` and a continuation of the negotiating process ... on the importance of averting both increased bloodshed and the return of the Pol Pot -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- regime to power, and declared our readiness to announce, together with other states, a moratorium on military assistance to all Cambodian factions as part of a comprehensive settlement.'' <PERSON> Lambertson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> appeared to have met its pledge to withdraw its military forces from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> late last month, ending an 11-year occupation. While there was no evidence to back reports of `` massive'' numbers remaining, the withdrawal should be verified as part of an overall political settlement, he said. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government assistance to the non-communist resistance has been and continues to be non-lethal,'' <PERSON> Lambertson </PERSON> said, an apparent reference to recent reports from the area about weapons assistance. In the days ahead, he said, `` it is critical to maintain support for Prince <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'' and the other non-communist Cambodians, he said. But Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the East Asian and <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had pursued a `` morally bankrupt'' policy of backing <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s insistence on including the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in an interim Cambodian government, `` not because we supported the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, but because we supported Prince <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Monday proposed a cease-fire with leftist rebels who have fought for 10 years to overthrow his country's government. He told the 44th <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> he will formally propose the cease-fire at a meeting with the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, on Oct. 16-17, `` because the suffering must be brought to an end once and for all.'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> invited all political factions in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to join the current government. He said his administration would discuss guarantees of security for the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. After his speech, he told a news conference the rebels' interest in political negotiations is partly due to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s reluctance to continued funding of guerrilla movements worldwide. About 70,000 people have died in the civil war. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s rightist ARENA party took office June 1 after defeating the incumbent, centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in elections. The U.S.-backed government and the rebels held a first round of preliminary peace talks in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in September. They decided then to hold more meetings to seek a negotiated settlement of the war. The rebels announced on Sept. 22 that they would not extend an 11-day truce that expired that day because the guerrillas felt the government was not responding positively and was increasing repression. The rebels last week launched a nationwide offensive that killed or wounded 78 people.

 About 1,200 teachers and other school workers went on strike Monday, canceling classes for 15,000 students in the state's fourth-largest district. The employees, represented by the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, walked out after rejecting the school board's proposal for binding arbitration to settle disputes over wage increases and insurance payments. A federal mediator had been trying to help the sides reach an agreement. Negotiations resumed Monday afternoon. Thirty-three schools were closed. The school board has offered employees a 2 percent pay raise for the next year, but teachers would have to pay from $ 22 to $ 34 per month for health insurance coverage for dependents. The district currently pays for dependents' health insurance. The teachers' union is asking for a 5 percent pay raise with the school district continuing to pay all health insurance bills. `` The district made every reasonable effort to avoid this interruption of the educational process,'' school officials said in a statement. There are `` certain undeniable economic facts which some in the teaching ranks are apparently unwilling to accept.'' The school district is trying to lower its $ 12.5 million debt. Union president <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Turley </PERSON> said his members, who have been working without a contract since the school year began, are sensitive to the district's financial distress. `` As a matter of fact, last year we agreed to work with a wage freeze with the promise that this year our concerns would be addressed in some way,'' <PERSON> Turley </PERSON> said. `` As we began the strike today, many of those concerns have not been addressed.''

 <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> pledged in a radio interview broadcast Tuesday to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stand trial on racketeering charges if allowed to leave and bury her husband in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Supporters of former President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to lift the ban on returning his body to his homeland for burial and let <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' widow and three children return. The high court was to consider the appeal at its regular weekly session Tuesday. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> died Thursday at age 72 in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. He had lived there in exile after a popular uprising in February 1986 ended his 20-year presidency. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> banned return of his remains and barred members of his family, saying a <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> burial in his homeland could ignite unrest. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters have been linked to repeated coup attempts, though protests since he died have been small and peaceful. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities have banned Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> from leaving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. She is to stand trial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in March on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges of embezzling <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government funds and using some of the money for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments. `` I will have to go back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> because I have to face the indictment,'' she told <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> DZXL </ORGANIZATION> in an interview from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. `` What I am defending here is not only the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> name but the entire nation.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who is free on $ 5 million bail, claimed the indictment against her tarnished the Filipino nation. Philippine officials believe the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family and their associates made off with up to $ 10 billion in embezzled money, kickbacks, and other funds during his administration. `` They have spat on Filipinos here,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said. `` Is it because our color is brown? No, I am going back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' She claimed <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> remained the legitimate president of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> until his death. `` He is the real president. She is illegal,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said, referring to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. `` This irregularity should be brought to all the courts of the world.'' The appeal filed Monday said the ban against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> violates the Philippine Constitution and Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s commitment to due process. `` What we are asking for is for the family to be allowed to come back and bury the president,'' said <PERSON> Nicanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Yniguez </PERSON>, leader of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> party. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' chief law officer, said the government will argue that the issue is political, not legal. On Sept. 15, the court ruled in an 8-7 decision that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' return would pose a security threat The appeal said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' death `` should completely remove apprehension, however unfounded, as to both his intent and capability to ` destabilize' conditions in the country.'' It argued that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s `` inability or failure to assure stability'' has been used `` to impair individual rights.'' <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Abadilla </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' former <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> area intelligence chief, said the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> group will organize a march on <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> from <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' birthplace in <LOCATION> Sarrat </LOCATION>, 250 miles to the north, if the petition is rejected <PERSON> Abadilla </PERSON>, vice governor of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' home province of <ORGANIZATION> Ilocos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION>, has been linked to previous coup attempts against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The Soviet foreign minister called Monday for an international `` New Deal'' to avert an impending economic disaster fueled by militarization, Third World debt, poverty and environmental problems. `` Right before our eyes the world is sliding into a deep economic depression,'' <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said in a speech in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` The debt of the Third World countries, the interest they have to pay and the pace of their economic development _ are these not the signs of an impending catastrophe?'' He added: `` We could one day begin competing not for political supremacy or spheres of influence but for access to water, fresh air and even a green lawn.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told the audience of about 350 people that the abolition of nuclear weapons, forgiveness of some Third World debts and increased protection for the environment will be essential for peace and worldwide stability in the next century. `` Radical bold steps are needed, a kind of ` New Deal,' a transition to a policy that would draw developing countries into the scientific, technological and information revolution,'' he said. In the 1930s during the Great Depression, President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> promised Americans a `` New Deal'' of government-sponsored social welfare programs. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> compared pessimism over the future of perestroika, the economic liberalization of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, to pessimism over the future of capitalism during the 1930s in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He noted that in 1931, 100,000 Americans requested permission to emigrate to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` There were bread lines in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Times Square and tents of the jobless huddled along <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drive </LOCATION>,'' he said, adding: `` It is well known that in those years there were widespread expectations in left-wing circles that the severe crisis of the world capitalist system would finally bring about the world revolution.'' He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s `` economic system is undergoing an adjustment. ... Something similar happened in the Unites States 60 years ago.'' But he predicted that `` so long as there is the will, the understanding of the situation and the determination to change things for the better _ and we certainly have them _ the economy can remedy its ills.''

 The House on Monday overwhelmingly approved President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s compromise plan to extend steel import restrictions on 29 foreign trading partners until April 1992. The vote was 354-10. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan, announced July 25, called for immediate negotiations with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and other leading steel-exporting nations to extend annual limitations on the volume of steel allowed to be shipped to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The original pacts, which expired Saturday, were negotiated by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1984 to give domestic steelmakers breathing space from subsidized, foreign competition. Many steel-district lawmakers had pushed the administration this summer to extend the curbs for five years. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opted for a smaller-scale, 2 -LCB- - year program in deference to steel-using manufacturers who argued that the quotas have driven up steel prices and caused supply shortages of some steel products The compromise all but eliminated debate on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. Opposition came largely from free-traders who felt the steel industry has had enough protection. `` It's not my first choice,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., who had opposed the industry's requests for a longer extension `` Nevertheless, I have to admit it's about as good a compromise as could be achieved.'' Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaydos </PERSON>, D-Pa., who represents a western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> steel district, said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> program `` is not a cure-all, but has been the most effective method of dealing with dumped imports `` This legislation is basically and fundamentally giving the steel industry in this country a little more time to become competitive. And they're well underway,'' <PERSON> Gaydos </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., has introduced a companion measure in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but no action on it has yet been taken With the old steel program due to expire Sept. 30, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration could not afford to wait until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acted to begin the painstaking process of negotiating new import ceilings.

 A federal drug agent, his wife and the owner of a construction company pleaded innocent Monday in an indictment that alleges thousands of dollars were funneled into real estate and coin collections. <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harker </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Harker </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, who owns <ORGANIZATION> SKT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION>, all entered the pleas before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> set a Dec. 4 trial. The charges against the three include tax violations, conspiracy and structuring bank deposits to avoid a $ 10,000 limit over which banks are required to report cash deposits. An indictment handed up by a grand jury last month details real estate and bank transactions and charges the Harkers had hundreds of thousands of dollars in transactions during years they reported only a fraction of that income. In all, there are 11 counts in the indictment, with <PERSON> Harker </PERSON> charged in eight of the counts, Ms. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> in six and Mrs. <PERSON> Harker </PERSON> in four. The indictment alleges that between 1986 and 1988 <PERSON> Harker </PERSON> and his wife `` spent, invested and profited by cash transactions exceeding $ 1 million.'' The indictment did not elaborate further on the charges and did not mention drugs. <PERSON> Harker </PERSON> is a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, but he earlier lived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>.

The indictment says Ms. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harker </PERSON> set up a company which funneled cash to real estate investments and rare coin transactions. All three were free pending the trial. As part of the bail requirements, all three must turn in their passports. <PERSON> Harker </PERSON> will be forced to get rid of his extensive gun collection despite his lawyer's arguments being a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent means <PERSON> Harker </PERSON> lives under serious threats. <PERSON> Harker </PERSON> could face up to 40 years in prison and $ 2 million in fines if convicted on all the charges.

 Former world champion <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> drew with fellow Soviet <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> in their first game Monday in a battle among four top chess grandmasters to decide the challenger to reigning champion <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and British grandmaster <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> adjourned on the 60th move in the other game in the World Championship Candidates' semifinal at <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>'s Wells ballet theater in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> was a pawn ahead in an endgame but most experts predicted a draw when play resumes. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, in the 13th annual <ORGANIZATION> Interpolis </ORGANIZATION> chess tournament in <LOCATION> Tilburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, on Monday earned the highest rating record in the history of the game, shattering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> player <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>'s 1972 record. The Soviet champion, by defeating <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Simen </PERSON> <PERSON> Agdestein </PERSON> in the final round, won 12 points out of 14 matches, the best tournament record ever. A win scores one point, and a draw half a point. This entitled 26-year-old <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> to a total of 2,795 points on the international ranking list of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, known by the French initials FIDE. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>'s 1972 record was 2,785 points. Although the next rating list will not be officially published before Jan. 1, <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, who plans no further tournament appearances this year, seems certain of his record. The second round in the semifinals in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> will be played Tuesday. The two winners of the semifinals contest will meet in the Candidates' final scheduled for March in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The winner will challenge <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> for his world title in a 24-game contest in October 1990. Playing with the disadvantage of the black pieces, <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> quickly neutralized <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON>'s opening advantage and exchanged both pairs of rooks to reach an endgame where neither side could make meaningful progress. After further exchanges, <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> forced a draw on the 44th move. <PERSON> Timman </PERSON>, playing white, gained an early opening initiative. <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> mistakes on the 17th and 21st moves let <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> reach an endgame with an extra pawn and superior placed pieces. `` It's just one of those days when you miss everything,'' said British grandmaster <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON>, the third ranked player in the world, of <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON>'s early play. But having gained a winning position, <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> failed to find several promising continuations and <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> put up the toughest of defenses. In the adjourned position, each side has a rook. <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> has three pawns and <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> two. `` It looks like a draw now,'' said <PERSON> Short </PERSON> after <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> sealed his 61st move. `` <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> missed a lot of chances.'' <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, 38, is heavily favored to knock out the 29-year-old <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON>. The outcome of the Timman-Speelman contest remains, in the words of British Grandmaster <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, `` completely unclear.'' <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, ranked second in the world, held the world title for 10 years before losing to <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> in November 1985. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> is famous for his so-called creeping style which analysts say squeezes the play out of his opponent's position like a boa constrictor squeezes the life from its prey. He has never lost to <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON>, the world's 14th ranked player, rose to prominence in 1977 when he won the world under-20 championship at age 17. He will be hoping for a repeat of <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>'s astonishing collapse at a June tournament in <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. Over a dramatic final three rounds, <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> lost every game for the first time in his long career. The winner of that tournament was <PERSON> Timman </PERSON>, a 37-year-old who is ranked eighth in the world. By virtue of his formidable performances, <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> was for many years the top Western grandmaster and in 1987 a magnificent run of victories put him within striking distance of <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON>, who celebrated his 33rd birthday Monday, is ranked 13th in the world. He has a solid and tricky playing style, punctuated with flashes of brilliance. <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON>, in the six-game quarter final, defeated Short by 3.5-1 .5 <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> said of the semifinals in his column in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s newspaper The Sunday Correspondent: `` Before <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>'s collapse at the end of <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> I would have rated him the overwhelming favorite against <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> Now I put him at about 70-30. I rate <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> favorite by about 55-45, but will strive mightily to upset these odds.'' The winner of each contest will receive $ 77,000, the loser $ 46,000. If the matches are tied 4-4 after eight games, two more games will be played. If it is still tied, the rules call for sudden death games. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled the 1990 title final for <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, starting Oct. 7.

 Rain, floods and a tornado heaped more misery on Hugo-wrecked <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on Monday, interrupting rebuilding efforts from the storm that pummeled the coast 12 days ago. Relief officials deluged with clothing urged donors to send building supplies, food and cash. `` I feel sorry for the people. It's terrible. It adds insult to injury,'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> meterologist <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Shenot </PERSON> said after 2.5 inches of rain fell in a 24-hour period on <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, the town hardest hit by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s 135-mph winds. A tornado in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, about 25 miles north of here, left two injured. About 100 people in <LOCATION> Anderson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 200 miles north, had to be evacuated due to flooding. The Broad and <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> rivers in <LOCATION> Gaffney </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Congaree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Matthews </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Waccamaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Conway </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Saluda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in Chappells all spilled over their banks Monday. The Tiger River rose 12 feet above flood stage, damaging a major telephone cable and knocking out long-distance service from <LOCATION> Spartanburg </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T. He had no estimate of the number of people affected, but said service was expected to be restored by nightfall. In neighboring <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, also deluged by rain Monday and also still recovering from the wrath of Hugo, <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> rescuers were looking for three people missing when a creek flooded and swept away their car. A fourth passenger was rescued after clinging to a downed tree for more than an hour. Aid from across the nation continued to pour into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> for victims of the hurricane. The response has been so overwhelming, though, that some officials do n't know what to do with everything. `` We have clothing backed up on us, including in boxcars that have come from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>,'' Maj. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said. `` People, generally speaking, only want a number of clothes ... and we've reached that certain amount. We're backlogged. In the fishing village of <LOCATION> McClellanville </LOCATION>, population 500, about 10 classrooms in the local school are filled `` from floor to ceiling with used clothing.'' `` Used clothing has almost choked us to death,'' <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON> said donations of non-perishable food items are still desperately needed. As cleanup efforts progress, hardware items will be in demand to help repair homes and businesses, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Sixty trucks carrying canned food, clothing and other relief material reached <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> on Monday, said <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, praising the cities across the country which have sent aid. `` There has never been in our country's history this degree of community sharing,'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. `` You can bet your bottom dollar that the next city that has a disaster, <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> will be represented'' in giving aid. A cash and food drive held at 10 college football games in six Southeastern states over the weekend generated about $ 60,000 and six tractor-trailer loads of canned goods, said organizer <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, R-S.C. His colleague, Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, took to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor Monday and continued his criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the agency coordinating the federal government's response to the disaster `` <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> does not have but 10 centers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> 10 days after the disaster,'' he said. `` And, as far as I know, they still have n't given out a financial grant yet.'' <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the vice president's wife, visited the hardest-hit areas of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and worked briefly at a <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> center in Moncks Corner on Monday. `` I do n't think news accounts can adequately describe the damage that is in this state. It's really incredible,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said `` It was very beneficial for me to see and really understand what the state is going through. We will be taking back information to the vice president and president.'' `` It was wonderful. I was n't expecting it,'' said <PERSON> Annabell </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, who was interviewed by Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for federal aid. The roof of Ms. <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>'s home blew off and water poured into the house during the hurricane. Hurricane Hugo slammed into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Sept. 21 with 135 mph winds, leaving at least 18 dead, 50,000 homeless, 270,000 jobless, and homes, businesses, schools and municipal buildings damaged or destroyed as far inland as <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION> and north to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. In all, 29 people were killed on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland. Damage has been estimated at $ 3 billion or more, with crop damage placed at some $ 100 million. Insurance agents have fanned out across the state since the day after the hurricane hit. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest home and automobile insurer in the state, expects to handle 130,000 claims worth $ 500 million, said company President <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` It would be the largest single disaster we've ever encountered,'' he said. There were signs the city was returning to normal. Classes resumed Monday at the College of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Cadets at The Citadel were asked to return Wednesday. An 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew was scaled back to 9 p.m. until 5 a.m., enforced by National Guardsmen toting M-16 rifles. The Ben Sawyer Bridge, which links the barrier islands of Isle of Palms and <LOCATION> Sullivans </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to neighboring <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION>, was expected to be back in place by Wednesday. The span of the swing bridge was knocked into the Intracoastal Waterway during the hurricane, cutting off all access to the islands by vehicle. In <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, beachfront property owners were told they could begin applying for permits to repair seawalls, homes and businesses that were less than two-thirds damaged by the hurricane. The Beachfront Management Act, enacted in 1988 to limit development along the state's 187-mile coast, prohibits rebuilding or repairs on structures that are more than two-thirds damaged. About 5,900 structures in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> were damaged or destroyed, said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gress </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which enforces the law. Also Monday, The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> announced that two state firms will buttress eight miles of beach from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pawleys </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> later this week at a cost of about $ 820,000. The sand is meant to block further erosion during expected high tides in mid-October at oceanfront properties already damaged by Hurricane Hugo. The federal government will pay 75 percent of the cost under an arrangement with <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>. More beaches may be declared eligible for such federal money or for state funds, said <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> <PERSON> Eskew </PERSON>, spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>.

 Rival Colombian drug cartels may be joining forces to keep smuggling and distribution lines open during their government's crackdown, a federal agent investigating a record cocaine seizure said Monday. Drug agents were surprised to find cocaine from both the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cali </ORGANIZATION> cartels in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> warehouse that housed 20 tons of cocaine, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zienter </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s special agent for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` It very well could be that, based on the pressure in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, this is a way cartels are trying to get much of the cocaine out of the country and to maintain distribution channels,'' said <PERSON> Zienter </PERSON>, who declined to say exactly how much of the cocaine was from the two cartels named for the cities where they are based. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said he did not believe it was unusual for the cartels to work together. `` They're not as competitive as might be the public perception when it comes to what is the best, most profitable way to distribute -LRB- the cocaine -RRB-,'' he said. `` What works for one will work for the other.'' Seven men were arrested Thursday and Friday in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> in connection with the 20-ton seizure Thursday. Arrested Thursday in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> were <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> <PERSON> McTague </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroy </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. On Friday, authorities arrested <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillon </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Panorama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, who sometimes uses the alias <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The four men arrested in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> appeared before a <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge, who agreed to postpone their arraignments on various drug charges until Oct. 6. The men were ordered to remain in jail without bail. Authorities said they plan to eventually consolidate the cases in a federal action. `` These are the major drug dealers, not just the runners,'' said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reiner </LOCATION>. `` They are as large as they get outside <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>.'' One of the men arrested in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, was described by authorities as a former customs inspector for the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government who became a major drug smuggling player. <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, 68, was arrested at the Flamingo Hilton hotel in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, along with his son, <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON> <PERSON> Anchondo </PERSON>, 38, and <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, 66, the brother of <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. Federal officials said Monday they did not have enough evidence to charge the brother in the case. The father and son case appeared before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Leavitt </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> on Monday, but refused to identify themselves on the advice of their defense attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesnoff </PERSON>. <PERSON> Leavitt </PERSON> set an identity hearing for Friday to be followed by a detention hearing, where motions for bail will be argued. They are being held without bail. <PERSON> Leavitt </PERSON> set an identity hearing for Friday to be followed by a detention hearing, where motions for bail will be argued. They are being held without bail. <PERSON> Chesnoff </PERSON> also requested a preliminary hearing for the two, which under law must be held within 10 days. <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> apparently ran the Mexican operation, said Special Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant-Deason </PERSON>. `` He picks up the ball once it is in his country, and moves back into the hands of the Colombians in <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Bryant-Deason </PERSON>. `` The rest of the men work for him. Anybody who gets that close to that much narcotics is an extremely trusted part of the organization.'' In the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> raid, authorities acting on a tip knocked apart a $ 6 padlock on <PERSON> Adriana </PERSON>'s Pottery Warehouse in suburban <LOCATION> Sylmar </LOCATION>, 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and found 40,000 pounds of cocaine, worth between $ 2 billion and $ 20 billion on the street. Also found was $ 10 million in cash. It was the world's largest drug seizure, topping the previous record of 12 tons seized in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The seizure also signaled the existence of a major drug route in which the drugs are shipped from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, taken across the border through <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and shipped, probably by truck, to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for American distribution. On Friday, officials raided six warehouses in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> as well as three homes in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Authorities said the warehouses were used as staging sites before the cocaine was transported to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Sepulveda </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> special agent in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, said his agents discovered an underground storage facility being excavated in one of six warehouses he and his men raided in east <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents who tore down a false wall found a concealed room about the size of a living room, he said. `` They had been digging a pit down about 20 feet. It would have been a good hiding place for narcotics,'' <PERSON> Sepulveda </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald-Post </ORGANIZATION>. Drug agents in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, meanwhile, had begun destroying the 20 tons of cocaine, said <PERSON> Zienter </PERSON>. The $ 10 million had been deposited into a downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> bank.

<HEAD>Exxon President Says `Chance' Was Oil Spill Factor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The president of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the 11 million-gallon <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> oil spill has given him renewed respect for `` what chance can do when it zeroes in on a target.'' `` <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> has made us appeciate all over again that plan as we will, take care as best we can, we are all subject to chance,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> told the state <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` Especially are we subject to human error.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, in only his third public appearance since the nation's worst oil spill on March 24, said the oil giant was not trying to avoid responsibility for the wreck of the Exxon Valdez Instead, he said, `` a recognition that chance often has a say in human affairs does allow a more dispassionate view of what happened.'' A breath analysis of former tanker Capt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> taken nine hours after the accident revealed his blood-alcohol level was .06. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> limit is .04. Investigators also are questioning why a third mate was at the helm as the tanker was navigated through glacial ice floes while <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> apparently was in his quarters. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, whose speech was interrupted three times by hecklers, said the oil spill had hurt his professional pride, but he said he was satisfied with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s billion-dollar cleanup was having results. He said summerlong efforts to treat tarred <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> beaches had produced `` very remarkable progress.'' `` Should we let chance events which could happen prevent us from taking risk?'' he asked. Without accepting risk, he said, there could have been no oilfields at <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and no trans-Alaska Pipeline. Without them, he said, Alaskans would have been denied a share in oil development wealth. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said managing risk was a related Valdez lesson. If great undertakings are forfeited or delayed because of the risk of accident, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said, `` the country and all of us will be the poorer.'' `` We all have some stake in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil,'' he said, noting that the state's oil meets 25 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said `` soaring imports, unrest in the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> and few viable oil and gas alternatives'' all remind him of conditions from the mid-1970s that led to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gasoline shortages. Development will continue to focus on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said, since analysts have predicted as much as a third of the nation's undiscovered oil is here <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> also said he was satisfied that Exxon policies regarding tanker captain training and alcohol use on the job are adequate. He said the oil spill was like `` a bad dream.'' He said it had prompted a review of company policy, which <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said was determined to be sound. `` I do n't mean that to sound as if we are self-satisfied,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> told a crowd of about 600. `` Clearly, procedures were n't followed,'' he said

 <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s foreign minister indicated Monday that if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues aiding <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels, the withdrawal of Cuban troops from his country might be halted. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON> claimed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials repeatedly told <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would extend diplomatic recognition to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and end aid to the rebels if <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> agreed to the Cuban troop withdrawal. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have linked the removal of an estimated 50,000 Cuban soldiers in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by mid-1991 to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s agreement to cooperate with a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan to grant independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> by April 1990. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, said in a telephone interview Monday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not promise to end aid to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> or to give diplomatic recognition to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. He mediated the accords last year between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal. `` In 1988, we did not make any commitment, in principle or otherwise, as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to end aid to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> did,'' he said. <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> said in December that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would not end its support for <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> while <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> received military aid from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In an interview at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON> was asked if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> might mean the Cuban troops would remain in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. He said, `` We have not discussed this question, but it can be a question.'' In August, when six <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> soldiers were killed in a rebel ambush, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said further attacks `` can unfavorably influence compliance with the timetable for the Cuban troops' withdrawal from the People's Republic of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.'' Both <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> and Angolan officials are taking their case to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON> said he has requested a meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> seeking continued aid to the rebels' National Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> has been battling <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government since 1975 when the country gained its independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and the Soviet-backed <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION> won a brief civil war. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> sent troops to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to help the government battle the rebels. A change in the scheduled withdrawal of the Cubans could jeopardize the planned independence for South African-ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> signed a peace accord June 22 and declared a cease-fire effective two days later, but it broke down within weeks amid charges of violations. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said recently that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers confirmed 15,927 <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> personnel left <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by Aug. 1 and the rate of departure was `` fully consistent'' with a timetable calling for complete withdrawal by mid-1991.

 <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, the independent candidate in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s first presidential election by popular vote in 29 years, has lost ground in opinion polls but still remains far in front of 22 other candidates. In the most recent survey for the Nov. 15 balloting by the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Folha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> was the choice of 33 percent of the voters, down from more than 40 percent four months ago. The populist <PERSON> Leonel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brizola </PERSON>, his most vehement adversary, had 15 percent, and <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Inacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> of the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Worker </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a front-runner early on, had 7 percent The private polling organization <ORGANIZATION> IBOPE </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 28 gave <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> 35 percent, <PERSON> Brizola </PERSON> 14 percent and <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> 8 percent. All other candidates came below the top three in both polls. <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, ideologically right-of-center and running under the banner of the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconstruction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, promotes himself as an independent without ties to vested interests. He promises to launch an all-out war on what he says is a corrupt government bureaucracy. `` There's a tremendous sense of moral outrage out there, a disgust with the status quo,'' said <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Diniz </PERSON>, a political science professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. `` Collor de Mello, running as the anti-candidate and anti-politician, has capitalized on it.'' But political opponents charge that <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> is guilty of the same kind of corruption he vows to eliminate. `` The man is a hoax,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Vivaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON> of <PERSON> Brizola </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> In August, <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON> delivered a 228-page report to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> containing allegations of corruption during <PERSON> Collor </PERSON>'s tenure as governor of the poor northeastern state of <LOCATION> Alagoas </LOCATION> from January, 1987, to this past May The accusations are now being investigated. The report charges that: _ He gave a $ 400,000 state contract to a company owned by a close political associate, <PERSON> Zelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardoso </PERSON> de Mello -LRB- no relative -RRB-, without competitive bidding _ He named thousands to state jobs just before he resigned as governor to run for president _ He spent almost $ 1 million on official propaganda extolling his administration's work during his last five months in office and more than half the money went to media outlets owned by his family _ Around 1987, a state bank exchanged a debt of $ 124,000 with the family-owned business TV Gazeta for free commercials on the station as well as on three radio stations and for advertisments in a newspaper owned by the family _ He spent more than $ 1 million in state money intended for emergency expenditures _ more than 5,000 percent above what was budgeted _ from January to <PERSON> May </PERSON> and some of the money was used to buy gifts of flowers, crystal and silverware for friends and political colleagues The charges run head-on with <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>'s image as an austere corruption fighter who cracked down on politicians and public servants. Collor de Mello is best known for his refusal as governor to pay the exorbitant salaries of an elite group of state employees, known as `` maharajas.'' Some of these functionaries, by combining two or three government jobs but not really working at them, were amassing paychecks of up to $ 10,000 a month in contrast to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s montly minimum wage of about $ 70. The battle with the maharajas is the centerpiece of <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>'s presidential campaign. He also has gained support by sharply criticizing President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, who many Brazilians blame for soaring inflation of more than 1,000 percent annually and rampant corruption. Direct presidential votes were banned by a right-wing military regime that ruled the country from 1964 to 1985. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, the first new civilian chief, took office in March, 1985, following a vote by an <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> made up of congressmen and state representatives. <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>'s campaign office has provided literature responding to some of the allegations against the candidate. According to the material: _ The contract with <PERSON> Zelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardoso </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> was legal No bidding was necessary, as she was clearly qualified for the job. _ With <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> as governor, <LOCATION> Alagoas </LOCATION> was among the three states that spent the least on official propaganda What advertising occurred was placed where it would reach the biggest audience. _ Emergency funds spent were `` modest,'' and a good part of the money went to worthy projects such as health care and housing Flowers were bought for receptions for visiting dignitaries. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Souza </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> and Statistics, said <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>'s popularity will be seriously tested with the free television time given the major candidates on all networks. `` The other candidates are using their TV time to go after <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, and most people are now going to hear the allegations of corruption against him for the first time,'' <PERSON> Souza </PERSON> said.

 A geomagnetic storm battering the Earth's poles is growing increasingly violent, and northern lights researchers call it the best thing that's ever happened to them The storm, caused by the bombardment of energy from solar activity, is making the shimmering aurora borealis brighter, more colorful and more spectacular than usual this year. <PERSON> Unni </PERSON> <PERSON> Pia </PERSON> <PERSON> Loevhaug </PERSON>, a space researcher, plans to fire bolts of electricity at the ionosphere, the layer of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s atmosphere that acts like a movie screen for the solar lights, to get an even better picture. The study should offer insights into the universe and theories of physics and `` increase man's storehouse of knowledge,'' she said. Her work may have practical applications in helping to overcome the havoc that the electrically charged lights can play with radio communications and navigation. In <LOCATION> Tromsoe </LOCATION>, 185 miles north of the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cicle </LOCATION>, the tourism board is thankful for the aurora borealis, which has drawn the curious and adventurous for hundreds of years. These amazing sheets of light are the offspring of solar winds, bursts of energized atomic particles that sweep 93 million miles through space and slam into the Earth's magnetic field at a speed of 1.56 million miles an hour. The collision releases the storm of energy seen in the constantly changing lights. Over the South Pole they are called the aurora australis. `` It's absolutely the most fantastic thing we have up here in the north,'' said tourist official <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON> <PERSON> Sissel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaklin </PERSON>. `` The aurora will just keep getting better and better from now until 1994 because the 11-year solar cycle is moving toward a peak.'' Space researcher <PERSON> Loevhaug </PERSON> keeps tabs on the lights summer and winter, even when they are dimmed or hidden by the midnight sun. `` We're already seeing things that I have never witnessed before,'' she said. She has studied the lights since 1983. From her laboratory 18 miles outside town, the 33-year-old physicist is taking part in European Incoherent Scatter Radar -LRB- EISCAT -RRB-, a project launched in 1981 to study the northern lights and the Earth's outer atmosphere. EISCAT's studies are funded by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. A transmitter fed by five megawatts of power, enough to light a small village, bounces a radar beam off the ionosphere 30 to 1,250 miles above the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Signals are picked up in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and relayed to <LOCATION> Tromsoe </LOCATION>. `` A radar wave is an electromagnetic field,'' <PERSON> Loevhaug </PERSON> said. `` It scatters through the northern lights and we receive a picture of what is going on. When solar activity builds up, it amplifies the lights and makes our studies easier.'' It took centuries for mankind to discover that solar flares, tongues of fire that leap thousands of miles above the sun's surface, caused the lights The <ORGANIZATION> Vikings </ORGANIZATION> believed the lights were flashes from the shields of warriors bound for heavenly <LOCATION> Valhalla </LOCATION>. Eskimos imagined dangerous spirits, while Swedes thought it was the torchlight of Lapps stalking stray reindeer. Centuries ago, <ORGANIZATION> Tromsoe </ORGANIZATION>'s people feared that laughing at the northern lights would anger the gods, who would strike them lame. The aurora has sometimes been seen far south of the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION>. It was mentioned in the Bible and pondered by <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> philospher <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON> 2,500 years ago. Even though lights are commonly seen in <LOCATION> Tromsoe </LOCATION>, `` a colorful display makes everyone drop what they are doing to watch,'' said <PERSON> Jaklin </PERSON>, the tourism official. `` They look fantastic even when you understand them,'' said <PERSON> Loevhaug </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Conservative Movement a `Paper Tiger'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When we left <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>, he had just undermined President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first choice for secretary of defense. Now he has decided to rebuild the American conservative movement from the bottom up, using the tactics of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>. That sounds unlikely, but it is no less plausible than the undoing of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for secretary of defense last winter after a controversy that surfaced when <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> accused him of misbehaving with women and whiskey. He said his testimony against another conservative stemmed from concern about Tower's character and about leadership at the Pentagon. <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> says he is asked about the Tower episode at his organizing and fundraising appearances for his <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, but that other conservatives have n't been critical, only curious. Nor, he said, have there been any lingering problems in his contacts with the White House. And conservative business seems to be thriving. <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>'s organization raised $ 3.34 million last year, has a staff of about 55, and has just expanded its row of small office buildings near the foot of <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> But while his outfit has prospered, <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> says the conservative movement has declined in political power over the past 10 years. He blames a sort of <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> fever on the right, and says he was guilty of it himself. Because of it, <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> said in an interview and in a monthly newsletter sent to about 600 leading backers of his operation, conservatives have lost clout in precinct, congressional district and state politics. He calls it a confusing time for conservatives who think they are making ideological headway but ca n't convert that into political action. As an example, he points to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision permitting state legislatures to restrict abortions, a victory for the right _ if abortion foes can get legislatures to take the next step. `` They are absolutely unprepared for that battle,'' <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> contends that liberals are outnumbered now, but can win political and legislative fights because their forces are organized and disciplined for state and local campaigns. Conservatives, he said, started moving people and political operations to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> became president. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> `` was correct in one thing he said: ` In any revolution, take the countryside and the capital will fall,''' <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> told his backers. `` Our strength is not in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Yes, we had and have influence here, and we helped to change certain policies. But we have not had real power ... `` We will only be powerful in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> when we once again speak for a powerful movement outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ when we have taken the countryside,'' he wrote them. <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> said he plans to test his operation first in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. He and his cadre went to <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> last weekend, to meet, he said, with 25 leaders of organizations identified with conservative causes, and then to begin training about 75 people in political operations. `` Recently, a high White House official who is sympathetic to our view described the conservative movement ... as a paper tiger,'' <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> said. `` Unfortunately, he is close to the mark. `` But it need not be so,'' he said. `` We are only a paper tiger because we are not organized.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> never has been a favorite with doctrinaire Republican conservatives; they did n't want him on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ticket in 1980 and they did n't want him nominated in 1988. Indeed, <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> told his supporters that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1988 primary victories were evidence of conservative weakness. But he says that a politically strengthened conservative movement would strengthen the president's hand in dealing with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Nobody's talking about taking on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' he said.

 Good grief! <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is 40 years old? Yep. <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> and the rest of the `` Peanuts'' gang hit the Big Four-O, a midlife plateau that usually sets off a good deal of soul-searching in most folks. Just do n't expect to see it mentioned in the award-winning strip. `` A comic strip should not make self-conscious statements,'' says <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>, 67, creator of the `` Peanuts'' characters who appear in more than 2,000 newspapers in 68 nations. `` There will be nothing in the strip.'' But that hardly means the milestone will pass unnoticed. An exhibition is slated for the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, and half time at the Super Bowl next January will feature a birthday extravaganza. Most importantly, the story of <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>, Snoopy, <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Linus </PERSON> and friends can finally be told. The whole truth comes out in the shy cartoonist's biography, `` Good Grief: The Story of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>.'' It's due out October 12 from Pharos Books -LRB- $ 17.95 -RRB-. The book, by <PERSON> Rheta </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimsley </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, is a first, says <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Henrici </PERSON> of Pharos, a sister company of the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> newspaper chain. <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> draws for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Features </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicate </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. `` Publishers have wanted to do a biography of him for years, but he has n't wanted to authorize one,'' she said. What made the difference this time? `` I liked her right away,'' <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a columnist for the <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION>. Good thing, too. There's no apprentice or designated cartoonist working for <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> who can tell the tale some day. `` When I retire that's the end of the strip,'' said <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>. `` It's in my contract.'' Also in his contract is the clause, `` was mainly my children's idea,'' said <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>, a father of five. `` They did n't want anyone but dad drawing it.'' It is a strip that's become a household name, and one that's brought <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> international fame He won the Rueben Award, comic arts highest honor, in 1955 and 1964. In 1978, he was named International Cartoonist of the Year, an award voted by 700 comic artists around world. The CBS Special `` A Charlie Brown Christmas'' won a Peabody award in 1966. <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the round-headed kid who seems to court bad luck, was named after a friend at art school and is <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>'s alter ego. Snoopy was inspired by a dog he had as child. The other characters all have distinct personalities and eccentricities. Somehow the strip would n't be the same if <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> actually kicked the football _ or <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> did n't yank it away. <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> studied art when he was in high school, after he saw a `` Do you like to draw?'' ad. `` The truth is, I was n't a very good student,'' he said. His first professional job was doing lettering for drawings in <ORGANIZATION> Timeless </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Topix </ORGANIZATION>, a Catholic comic book. He later taught at the Art Instruction School, and sold cartoons to the Saturday Evening Post. His cartoon feature, `` Li' l Folks,'' which was the start of Peanuts, was developed for <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in 1947. The strip was sold to a syndicate in 1950, and the name changed to `` Peanuts.'' The artist, whose income for 1987-88 was estimated by <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> at $ 62 million, is almost a natural resource in the wine country city of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rosa </LOCATION>, about 80 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. He spends much of his time at his <LOCATION> Redwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Empire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ice </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arena </LOCATION>, where he frequently plays hockey or sips coffee at the rink's Warm Puppy snack bar. The actual drawing of the strip takes place in his office at One Snoopy Place, a single-story, stone-and-redwood building. It's appropriate that the little beagle's monicker got the nod for the office It was the Snoopy and Red Baron episodes that really put the strip into orbit. Snoopy, until then just another pet pooch, became a World War I flying ace in October 1965 and piloted the strip to its pinnacle. `` It worked beautifully, so beautifully that nothing can be expected to duplicate it,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> recounts. Although the book contains stories about all the strip's characters, the most interesting is about a character never shown _ the `` little red-haired girl'' who is <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s unrequited love `` Peanuts'' began syndication on Oct. 2, 1950, 19 days after <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>' proposal of marriage was turned down in his native <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, by <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Wold </PERSON>, the original red-haired girl. `` It's heartbreaking,'' said <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>, who proposed five years after plowing across <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in a half-track as an infantryman during World War II. `` It's something you never get over, but I think the only purpose in recounting the story was to show how experience prompts a cartoonist's ideas.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, whose book discloses that the artist suffers from depression, says <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>' life contains many rejections he translated to the strip. `` Rejection is his specialty. Losing his hobby. He has spent a lifetime perfecting failure,'' she said. At first <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> thought the artist was kidding about <PERSON> Wold </PERSON>'s turning him down `` He talked about it as if it took place last year,'' she said in an interview. Along with depression, the artist also has bouts of agoraphobia, the fear of being alone in public places from which escape might be difficult. `` The sight of a hotel lobby, for example, puts <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON> in a sweat,'' writes <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. Such fears and troubles are too bad, says the author. Yet, there would not be <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>' `` unique gift to the world without the sensitivity that so limits his personal life.'' And what does `` Peanuts'' mean to <PERSON> Schulz </PERSON>? `` This is my whole life,'' he said. `` I pour my heart into this, every day, and some people do n't even read the comics.''

<HEAD>Italian Official Creates Fuss Over Saving Leaning Tower of Pisa</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<HEAD>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PISA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The tower of <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION> has been leaning for 800 years, so the keeper of the marble wonder ca n't understand what all the latest fuss is about. It's true that experts have been making dire predictions for years. But there was a real tower tizzy after the minister of public works, <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Prandini </PERSON>, sounded an alarm recently that scared all of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Newspapers immediately published headlines warning of a `` red alert'' for the tower, raising fears that one of the symbols of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> could, at worst, topple, or at best, be closed for repairs. But <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Toniolo </PERSON>, chairman of the committee responsible for preservation of the monument, says there's nothing to get excited about. `` There is absolutely nothing new in the situation,'' he said in an interview. `` To say that the tower is in danger, so what? It's always been in danger. `` What does the tower need?'' <PERSON> Toniolo </PERSON> added. `` It needs to be left in peace.'' The 180-foot circular tower, begun by <PERSON> Bonnano </PERSON> <PERSON> Pisano </PERSON> in 1173, started to tilt almost immediately because the ground shifted underneath. It was completed by <PERSON> Tomasso </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Andrea </PERSON> with the construction of the belfry between 1360 and 1370. The tower now leans about 13 feet off the perpendicular, but <PERSON> Toniolo </PERSON> and other tower experts say it would not topple for more than another century if it continues to tilt at its average rate. According to the last measurement in June, the tower leaned an additional 0.008 inches in the last 12-month period. The average yearly tilt since the measurements began in 1918 is 0.047 inches. `` The thing should fall over,'' <PERSON> Toniolo </PERSON> said, seated behind a desk in his office, the tower visible through Gothic windows. `` How long will this lean last? No one can say. But at a certain time, it will reach the point where it falls. That will take more than 100 years. It could be 200, 250 years.'' For decades, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> has tried to come up with ways to save the tower. A number of national and international commissions have proposed plans for stabilizing the monument, but none has ever been implemented. `` The problem of trying to stabilize the tower is enough to make the hands of great technicians tremble,'' said <PERSON> Gero </PERSON> <PERSON> Geri </PERSON>, a topography professor who has been measuring the lean of the tower since 1969. `` Who wants to risk doing something that could upset the equilibrium?'' The latest plan, approved by the government in 1987, is to implant a wheel-shaped support below the base around the tower. It would be connected by concrete spokes to the marble foundation. The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> appointed a commission a few months ago to study the soil conditions to determine whether the plan can go ahead. But <PERSON> Toniolo </PERSON> believes the tower ca n't be fixed until officials figure out what has kept the 14,000-ton structure standing all these years. `` All the technicians say it ca n't be understood,'' said the white-haired, 80-year-old retired radiologist who has headed the monument preservation committee for 12 years. `` This means there are special conditions of the terrain which have n't yet been explained. If you ca n't understand this, how can you do a project to save it?'' <PERSON> Prandini </PERSON>, a Christian Democrat who has been public works minister for barely two months, apparently wants to find a solution. After expressing his concern over the state of the tower, <PERSON> Prandini </PERSON> ordered a panel of technical experts to report back quickly on the feasibility of a stabilization plan. He also told them to devise a round-the-clock monitoring system for the tower. Mayor <PERSON> Giacomino </PERSON> <PERSON> Granchi </PERSON>, a Socialist, accused <PERSON> Prandini </PERSON> of exaggerating the situation and trying to get publicity for himself. <PERSON> Prandini </PERSON> replied, `` I do n't see why one wants to make a controversy out of a well known problem only because there's the will to act decisively and go from the study phase to concrete realization.'' The sense of urgency was heightened by the collapse in March of the 900-year-old tower of <LOCATION> Pavia </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, killing three people. Experts said the 255-foot tower crumbled either because of natural decay in the mortar holding the bricks together or because of a sudden sinking following a dry spell that lowered the water table. `` The example of <LOCATION> Pavia </LOCATION> does n't count because no one ever monitored it,'' <PERSON> Toniolo </PERSON> said. `` No other tower in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is monitored like <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION>'s. If <PERSON> Pavia </PERSON> had all the instruments that we have, they would have known a few months before'' that it was in danger. <PERSON> Toniolo </PERSON> said he receives an average of 40 proposals a year from people around the world, mostly Americans, for saving the tower. The latest: erecting a huge statue of Saint <PERSON> Ranieri </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION>'s patron saint, with arms raised to hold up the tower Some even suggest trying to straighten the tower, a notion that makes <PERSON> Toniolo </PERSON> shudder. `` Never, for heaven's sake,'' he said. `` It was born tilted. Our ancestors built it that way eight centuries ago. It must remain that way.''

 Slowly, the largest animals ever to roam the planet are returning to the craggy coves and lofty fiords of <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, beckoning the curious from across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, as well as scientists who want to study them. While the seasonal arrivals of the whales are met with some trepidation by fishermen, Newfoundlanders are learning that a live whale can be just as valuable as a dead one.

 Spring comes late and winter comes early to these climes, governing the coming and going of exotic seabirds, moose, caribou and seals. But the creatures that linger most on the mind are the whales. In fact, a group of scientists will gather in <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> in February under the auspices of <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> to tally the number of humpback whales left in the world by comparing thousands of photographs taken over the years of humpback tails, which have telltale fluke patterns. Situated off the food-rich Grand Banks, where codfish is king, the seas around <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> provide enough food, deep water and isolation to satisfy the pickiest leviathan. `` This is the biggest restaurant in the world's oceans. It's got a varied menu, everything you want and all you want, and it's cheap,'' says whale researcher <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beamish </PERSON>, who conducts whale-watching expeditions out of Trinity The waters off <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> have the highest concentration of whales in the world, says <PERSON> Beamish </PERSON>, who holds a doctorate in marine bioacoustics from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> and a master's degree from <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> Up to 25 species of cetaceans _ whales, dolphins and porpoises _ migrate every summer to the northwest <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to feed. `` If a place like <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> is a fish-and-chips joint that seats 25 people, then this is the entire city of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, which seats 5 million people all eating gourmet, 15-course meals,'' <PERSON> Beamish </PERSON> says. But the waters around <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> have not always been hospitable to whales, whose numbers have been decimated by 500 years of relentless pursuit and slaughter by whalers from several continents. Since the time of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, the coastlines of <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Labrador </LOCATION> were littered with makeshift whale factories, which were moved from one site to another after whales in an area were depleted. Whales were deemed expendable. The rendering of their blubber provided light for the streets of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and food for <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Observations of their habits were limited to those who hunted them, almost to extinction. Since the turn of the century, more than 2 million whales have been reported killed for food, oil, cosmetics and other products. But after the 1960s, the decade of increasing environmental awareness, and the 1970s, the decade of discovery about the intelligence and gentleness of whales, the 1980s have been a decade in which most nations banned whaling _ at least temporarily. While tourists spend thousands of dollars to travel here to view whales, the fishermen who spend the most time in the company of the gentle giants view them more like city pigeons than a national treasure. `` My stepfather is a fisherman and I ca n't go home and speak of what a great day I had,'' says <PERSON> Collette </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rexton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Beamish </PERSON>'s assistant on the whale-watching expeditions. `` To him, the whales are a nuisance. They get in their traps and cost them a lot of money.'' Whales often wreak havoc with expensive fishing nets, and toothed whales compete for the capelin, squid and cod that contribute to <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>'s $ 700 million fishing industry. `` For fishermen, whales are marine rats. It's a pest, an endangered pest, because it really does cost them money,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lien </PERSON>, professor of ocean studies at <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The provincial government and whale researchers such as <PERSON> Beamish </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lien </PERSON> have been working diligently over the past decade to create goodwill between whales and the fishermen. Educational programs about whales have been presented in just about every village and outport _ tiny settlements reachable only by boat. And when a whale gets trapped in a net, a toll-free hot line can put a fisherman in contact with a rescue team that will try to free the animal and save the net. `` In <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> as a whole, attitudes have changed,'' says <PERSON> Lien </PERSON>. `` We've printed a half million whale posters, and I claim they have replaced <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> catalogs in the outhouses. Now 90 percent of the fishermen can identify a humpback, for instance. Before, it was a very low figure.'' Before hot lines and whale rescues, one in two whales trapped in fishing nets would die, <PERSON> Lien </PERSON> says. This year, only three of 65 humpbacks that blundered into nets died. `` When I first came here, live whales cost <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> fishermen over $ 1 million a year from lost or damaged nets and all,'' <PERSON> Beamish </PERSON> says. `` And now tourism probably brings in $ 1 million a year to the island. `` What I did and what I'm proud of is that I came to <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> hoping to make live whales more valuable to Newfoundlanders than dead whales. And we did that.'' A new generation of Newfoundlanders also is emerging, one much more atuned to the special creatures in their midst. `` We surveyed 7,000 kids in <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> and found that seal pups and whales were their favorite animals. They were right up there with puppies and kittens,'' says <PERSON> Lien </PERSON>. `` That's probably the most important thing an animal can do for its survival _ get humans attached to it.'' There are two kinds of whales, toothed whales like the dolphin, sperm and killer whales, and baleen whales like the blue, humpback and right whales, which feed on krill, tiny shrimp-like plankton, gulped by the thousands while the water is expelled through a mesh of whalebone called baleen. Some whales, like the rare blue whale, the largest animal ever to have lived, can be seen in winter feeding near the edge of ice floes along the island's undulating, 5,500-mile-long coastline.

 But most of <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>'s whales, notably humpbacks, minkes and fins, breed and calve in warm southern waters during the winter and migrate north in summer to feed on the millions of tiny smelt-like capelin that spawn on <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> beaches. `` North to feed, south to breed,'' says <PERSON> Beamish </PERSON>. With little exaggeration, that's just about all that's known about these warm-blooded, air-breathing mammals. What they do at night, how deep they dive, where they go in the winter, how they communicate, how some species feed, why certain whales beach themselves, how long they live, how often they give birth, even whether some species still exist, are all mysteries. `` Whales are really mysterious animals because they seem to disappear. They'll go down and you do n't see them ever again,'' says <PERSON> Beamish </PERSON>, who spent 10 years at the <ORGANIZATION> Bedford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanography </ORGANIZATION>. `` We know a fraction about whales of what we do about other animals on Earth because we ca n't study them at nighttime, we ca n't study them when they're below the surface, we ca n't study them in captivity and we ca n't study them in the winter very well. Nevertheless centuries of hunting whales have yielded some of their secrets. The sperm whale for instance feeds mostly on squid, preferably the giant squid and octopus. That requires that it dive to great depths, although like all whales it is an air breather. One sperm whale, a relative youngster at 45 feet long, was found at a depth of 3,240 feet by the cable repair ship All <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1932. It drowned apparently in mortal combat with the cable it encountered while hunting squid. Almost 200 feet of cable was twisted around its jaws and body. While most whales have a gentle reputation, the killer whales are the most formidable. Thirty feet long and capable of swimming at about 30 mph, they are unmatched in lethal potential. They are voracious, some caught with the remains of more than 20 porpoises and seals in their bellies. But no whale challenges the imagination as much as the great blue, protected now but once hunted almost to extinction. Some 100 feet long and 150 tons, it is the largest creature on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, and may have begun its evolutional history on dry land. There are vestigial hipbones in the rear third of its body indicating that it may have prowled the primordial land. It was a boon to the whalers. One blue whale could yield 45 tons of meat and 40 tons of blubber. Its skeleton alone weighed 27 tons and its internal organs 18 more. <PERSON> Beamish </PERSON>, who moved to <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION> 10 years ago to study whales more closely, says he sometimes gets frustrated at the very thing that makes them so mysterious _ their elusiveness. `` Sometimes I feel like switching to an easier animal,'' he says wryly. `` I do this as well as anybody in the world, so I'm on the edge of knowledge. But you'd like to work on an animal you can work with more than just a few hours a day.'' Nevertheless, there is something about whales that makes them special in the marine kingdom and attractive to scientists. `` They are highly intelligent, and their brains are extremely unusual and as complex as ours,'' says <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Whale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` Not only that, they arrived at their brain size at least 2 million years before we attained ours.'' `` They are at the top of the evolutionary ladder among ocean animals and man is at the top among land animals,'' <PERSON> Beamish </PERSON> says. `` So even though you get less data, the data might be more meaningful.'' The body of knowledge about whales, for the most part, is a recent acquistion _ begun only in the latter half of this century. The reason may be found in a little clapboard museum in historic Trinity dedicated to the town's fishing and whaling past. Curator <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsworthy </PERSON>, a former fish-plant worker, fingers the long, sinewy fibers of a humpback's baleen. Looking out the window at <LOCATION> Trinity </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, a favorite haunt of whales, the slight man of 63 years remembers when fish plants smelling of salt cod covered the rocky coast and recalls stories of the carcasses of dead whales hauled ashore for rendering a century before. In many parts of the globe, the animals are still scarce. Some species, like the bowhead and right whale -LRB- so called by the whalers because it would float when killed, therefore `` right'' -RRB- are highly endangered, while others, like <PERSON> Longman </PERSON>'s beaked and the melon-headed whale, have not been seen for decades. Slowly, the largest animals ever to roam the planet have returned to the craggy coves and lofty fiords of this verdant island. And their arrival in the spring is met with both eagerness and trepidation by the local inhabitants. `` It means spring is here, just like when my animals have young, when the first lamb is born,'' says <PERSON> Goldsworthy </PERSON>. `` The first whale is like the first robin. The ponds start to melt and you take your rod and go out for a meal of trout.'' `` You get this burst of energy,'' says <PERSON> Collette </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>. `` Research does n't go so well on the first day because I ca n't sit down. I still feel like that every morning with our first humpback sighting.'' Sitting at a table in the small restaurant of <PERSON> Beamish </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> relaxes before the start of another day of note-taking on rough seas. After several days of rain and fog _ an obvious deterrent to whale watching _ the clouds part and the sun warms the small, clapboard houses built haphazardly along the steep slopes. `` You ca n't describe the feeling that goes over you when you see a whale for the first time or a humpback breach,'' <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> says, her face beaming. `` It does n't matter who you are, where you're from I do n't see how you ca n't feel that way, such a big animal, so friendly. It's like they have this need to communicate. `` They want to and are trying, it's just that no one understands them.''

 Like a roller coaster stuck on go, the 60-mph Zodiac raft assaults mile after mile of 12-foot swells, startling puffins into diving for safety, as tourists pursue an elusive minke whale. `` Blow, 2 o'clock,'' yells a passenger, pointing into a sun-washed horizon as the curved, black back of the minke appears for a split-second breath of air. Minutes elapse before the whale watchers, all peering intently into the vast expanse of ocean, spy the sickle-shaped dorsal fin that appears as a minke spouts. `` Blow, 6 o'clock,'' yell two people at once as the <ORGANIZATION> Zodiac </ORGANIZATION> makes a quick left turn and veers out toward open sea. After two days of rain and fog, the participants in a three-day whale-watch expedition in <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> are eager to see what they paid thousands of dollars and traveled thousands of miles to see. Their patience is rewarded this sunny day in late summer. Several minkes make appearances in coves at the base of high, rocky cliffs, and the group of seven whale watchers establish brief contact with a solitary humpback, an endangered whale known for its melodious songs. `` I felt totally overwhelmed by it all,'' says <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, 35, an English native teaching in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. `` You really felt as if the humpback was there with us. She came and rolled right beside the boat as if to say, ` Look, are n't I lovely?''' `` I think we were relieved, actually, that we had seen what we came here to see,'' says <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, 33, a stage technician for the Royal Shakespeare Theater in <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Whale enthusiasts gravitate to this remote Canandian province at the easternmost edge of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because of the abundance and variety of whales that migrate here every summer. What they find is sometimes more than they expected _ seals, bald eagles, Arctic seabirds, and, inland, caribou, bear and moose. What they get in programs like those run by whale researcher <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beamish </PERSON> in the historic village of <LOCATION> Trinity </LOCATION> is a chance to participate in experiments in human-whale communication. `` Most people's expectations are just to see a whale, and as soon as they walk in the door we tell them that we do a lot more than that. We try to get them involved in a communication experience, which is a lot more valuable,'' says <PERSON> Beamish </PERSON>, who has operated his Ocean Contact program for 10 years. <PERSON> Beamish </PERSON> conducts three - and seven-day expeditions costing up to $ 1,000 Air fare is not included. Participants are fed and housed at an old inn in <LOCATION> Trinity </LOCATION>, where evenings consist of whale-related slide shows, movies and discussions. Days are spent at sea looking for and, hopefully, `` talking'' to whales. The talking actually consists of electronic beeps sent through the water several times at certain intervals. A `` conversation'' develops when a whale responds, either by spouting, breaching, slapping his tail or lifting his head above water. Participants help work the equipment and scan the horizon for the whale's response In his `` Whale Watcher's Handbook,'' author <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON> says, `` Sooner or later, the serious whale watcher finds himself in <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>.'' But serious whale watchers also are finding there's more to this ruggedly beautiful island than just whales. `` People come here to see whales. That's one of the things on the list, but it's not the only thing,'' says <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, chief of visitor activities at Terra Nova National Park near <LOCATION> Trinity </LOCATION>. `` They are also interested in seeing icebergs and the wide-open spaces.'' `` <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> is kind of like the last outpost,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Terra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nova </ORGANIZATION> superintendent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON>. `` The frontier ethic that existed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is still here. You still go out and cut your wood, get your moose or caribou and your fish.'' <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 40, an Englishman teaching in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, said the whales and the promise of pristine country are what attracted him to <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Beamish </PERSON>'s program. `` When I asked the travel agent if she could get me a flight to <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, she said: ` Nobody ever goes there. Why do you want to go there for?' I said, ` Great, then that's where I want to be.''' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> woodworker <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Zadoretzky </PERSON>, 39, says she felt renewed by such close contact with animals that, to her, symbolize `` the things we are not'' in a land that is `` an idealization of what I think of as peaceful, beautiful country.'' `` Whales are superior beings who live in the ocean, and we are supposedly the superior beings on land. They are a great force who live peaceably under the sea, but we are a destructive force, and we are beginning to realize that it might cost us. `` They're our salvation. If we can save them, we are starting to save ourselves.''

 It was once called the `` American Clyde,'' after the <LOCATION> Clyde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, then a major shipbuilding center in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 When the unfinished hulls of two <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships leave the yard of <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> will be without a shipbuilding business for the first time in more than 300 years. Since <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> built the Amity in 1682, the year <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> came from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, companies putting together seagoing ships have been a part of the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> landscape. At one time or another, there were 38 shipyards along the river and its tributaries. It has been in decline here for decades, but spokesmen say a national slump in shipbuilding, aggravated by new government policies, really finished off a once-proud industry that was a national leader. For example, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON> advertised steamboat trips along the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> 17 years before <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> ran his <LOCATION> Clermont </LOCATION> along the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>. Some of the Civil War-era ironclad `` monitors'' were built here. <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> shipyards built boats to defend the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup In <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pusey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> shipyard built them for trade on the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. In 1915, with war under way in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> built what was then the world's largest shipyard _ 50 shipways employing 34,000 workers. It turned out 122 cargo ships and troop transports in two years. The river was nicknamed the `` American Clyde,'' after the Clyde in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, then the center of European iron shipbuilding. The proud tradition continued down to 1960, when the huge aircraft carrier <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawk </PERSON> was launched from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> yard in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, right across the river from the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> waterfront. That yard closed soon after and is now being demolished. The Kitty Hawk is being modernized now in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION>, which does ship repair work but has n't built a ship from the keel up since 1971. The two ships the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ordered from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Shipbuilding sit at the river's edge, one tied up in a slip and the other braced in a dry dock and minus the bow, stern and deckhouse. A mortgage agreement filed in the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recorder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deeds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> gives the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> title to four parcels of land owned by <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ship </PERSON> if the company fails to pay for the costs of finding another company to finish the work. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Shipbuilding was known as <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Drydock when <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> opened it in 1916 to guarantee a supply of tankers. Over the years it built 674 oceangoing ships. Sun got out of the shipbuilding business in 1982 and sold the yard to a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> company that renamed it. It was later sold to three Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, real estate developers. In May 1985, <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ship </ORGANIZATION> won a $ 222.4 million contract to build two fleet oilers for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, vessels that refuel combat ships at sea. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> planned to buy 18 of the 677 -LCB- - foot, T-AO-187 class tankers eventually, and <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ship </ORGANIZATION> stood to gain a good share of that business if it completed the contract successfully It did n't. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> renegotiated the contract to $ 331.4 million, but <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ship </ORGANIZATION> announced in February that it did n't have enough money to finish the ships with the cost overrun factored in. Work stopped on the ships and <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ship </ORGANIZATION> laid off 1,200 workers. Rumors have said the hulls, one 90 percent finished and the other 70 percent done, will be towed to either <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> to be finished. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, the yard's general manager, could n't say what would become of the unfinished ships. `` The contract has been terminated,'' he said. `` We are not involved with where they will go. I have no idea when they will leave.'' What went wrong? Why could n't the yard finish a couple of tankers, basically like ships that were built here for years? `` There were a lot of circumstances contributing,'' <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. `` We bid in a time frame when labor rates were low. There was also an expectation of follow-up work. Our costs turned out to be much higher than we expected, and there was no follow-up work to spread them over.''

 Nationwide, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said, shipbuilding is in trouble. `` There's no business,'' he said. `` The only new construction in this country for the past couple of years has been for the government.'' Why? `` Aging facilities, and other countries' yards are subsidized,'' he said. `` It's impossible to compete in the world market the way we're having to compete.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> maritime administration once subsidized the construction of new vessels, but those subsidies have been terminated, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoker </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> agreed in part. `` For purposes of discussion, it's fairly accurate,'' he said. `` You can just watch the downward trend.'' In 1982, the council counted 110 shipbuilding companies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, employing 112,000 workers. This year it's down to 69 companies employing 72,000. `` We lost 41 shipyards and 41,000 people,'' <PERSON> Stoker </PERSON> said. Shipbuilding in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area has been devastated in recent years, <PERSON> Stoker </PERSON> said. Other areas that were hit hard were south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration terminated shipbuilding subsidies, <PERSON> Stoker </PERSON> said, arguing that the government should n't be interfering in the private sector, propping up the industry. `` But that was looking at the world through naive and myopic lenses,'' he said. `` It does n't recognize that if we are not subsidized and the rest of the world is, we are doomed.'' What saved American shipbuilding through the'80s, <PERSON> Stoker </PERSON> said, was rebuilding the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. With that almost complete, American shipyards face tough times again. Rather than asking the government to return to subsidies, the council wants the major shipbuilding nations _ <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> _ to drop government intervention in the business. The council filed a complaint in June with the Office of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Trade Representative against the four. It agreed to withhold the petition while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tried to negotiate an agreement on shipbuilding subsidies. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> agreed to seek agreements with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading partners both through the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> and through the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. `` I have received assurances from representatives of all these countries that they will negotiate seriously on this matter,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> set a deadline of March 31, 1990, which <PERSON> Stoker </PERSON> called `` fairly aggressive.'' `` But we ca n't really allow the process to drag on,'' <PERSON> Stoker </PERSON> said. `` A number of our companies are potentially in trouble.'' <PERSON> Stoker </PERSON> agreed it will not be easy to persuade other governments to stop subsidizing shipbuilding. `` It depends on how you define a subsidy,'' he said. `` They tend to think of a subsidy as a direct payment from the government to a business. But when they make export credit available to a shipyard, they do n't think they're subsidizing it.'' <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> is pessimistic. `` Those countries have decided they want to maintain a shipbuilding industry,'' he said. `` In this country, we've apparently made the decision not to have one. <PERSON> Stoker </PERSON> is more optimistic. The nation still has areas where employment is high in ship construction and repair _ the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and the area around <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roads </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Other big yards are in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade negotiators have started talks with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Stoker </PERSON> said the major talks are expected in mid-October. `` We are hoping the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiating position can be hammered out later this month,'' he said. `` We frankly think some attitudes about the shipbuilding industry in the nation have changed.''

<TEXT>
 The last working commercial shipyard in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> was started by an oil executive making sure his company had enough tankers. It went out of business trying to finish a pair of military fuel ships. <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> incorporated <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Drydock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1916, a year after company President <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pew </PERSON> had taken a business trip to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and been impressed with that country's naval strength. Sun Ship's first vessel, the SS <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Sun </PERSON>, slid down the ways in October 1917. By the end of World War I the yard had built six tankers plus three minesweepers for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. Over the years <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Ship </PERSON> emerged as one of the nation's largest privately owned shipyards. Its Sun Doxford diesel engine eventually made it the biggest American manufacturer of large marine diesel. It also launched the first all-welded tanker, the SS White Flash, in 1931. But its glory years were during World War II, when an average of a ship a week rolled down its 28 ways. On one day, the yard launched three ships. By the end of the war, Sun Ship had produced more than 250 ships _ 40 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tankers built. It converted, armed and repaired 1,000 more. The yard employed 33,500 people. But the end of the war brought a sharp decline in ship construction. The other yards on the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> began closing and by 1975 only Sun Ship was left. By the end of 1980, the parent <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> estimated it had lost more than $ 200 million keeping the shipyard alive. Sun announced it was getting out of the shipbuilding business in January 1981. A company official estimated the shipyard would be sold for $ 30 million to $ 40 million. In February 1982 the yard and its assets were sold for a reported $ 8 million to <ORGANIZATION> Levingston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> company that renamed the yard <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Shipbuilding. <PERSON> Levingston </PERSON> sold control two years later to three real estate developers from Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>. But shipbuilding has n't been very successful for Penn Ship. In May 1985, when the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> awarded the contract for two 677 -LCB- - foot fleet oilers, it was hailed as a deal that would keep the yard alive Later, <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ship </PERSON> would argue that it had to submit an unreasonably low bid to get the contract and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> renegotiated the deal to $ 331.4 million. In February, <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ship </ORGANIZATION> said that was n't enough either, and it suspended work with an eye to hiring another yard to finish the job Finally the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> decided to find a new contractor itself. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, the yard's general manager, said <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ship </ORGANIZATION> made its bid when labor was plentiful and rates were low but soon had trouble finding qualified employees in a booming economy. How could a shipyard that built tankers for years lose a contract to build a couple of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> fuel vessels? <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON>, business agent for Local 802 of the <ORGANIZATION> Boilermakers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, says the company made a mistake by hiring Japanese consultants to introduce `` modular'' construction techniques. In traditional shipbuilding, workers build the hull and install mechanical and electrical equipment inside the cramped confines. The new technique has workers completely build entire sections and then weld or bolt them together. `` That's one thing we're bitter about,'' <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> said. `` We've been building 50-ton units and lifting them into place for years The Japanese did n't show us anything we did n't know already. But the company treated them like gods while they treated their own employees like dirt.'' <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> disagrees. `` The modular techniques helped,'' he said, insisting that the shipyard's troubles would have been even worse without them. Absenteeism was n't especially a problem, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said, but hiring skilled workers was. `` That's really true throughout the country,'' he said. `` The shipbuilding industry used to have a lot of skilled people. Most shipyards used to have apprentice programs, and they were major employers. Those people have left and found work in other areas. `` These are people in the skilled trades _ electricians, sheet metal workers, machinists and so on _ and they do n't have any trouble finding new jobs. If you have to build up again, you have to start over.''

 Lifesaving drugs are often available in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> long before they are on the market in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The reason is a difference in the bureaucracies of the two countries. While some argue that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> should speed up its drug approval process, others warn that it's risky to be hasty.

 In 1985, a desperately ill <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> was one of many AIDS patients who fled to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for a drug they could n't get in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The drug did n't work. But at the time it was the only hope, and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> doctors could n't prescribe it. Last year, French doctors began prescribing the so-called abortion pill to terminate pregnancies. <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women may not get it for years. These are two examples among many in which the French became the first to receive the potential benefits of new drugs. It happens because the French drug approval system is simpler and faster than that of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Advocates of the French system say it has elements that could be adopted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, cutting the time that <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> must wait for new drugs. The issue has become increasingly important as the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> faces growing pressure to speed the approval of experimental cancer and AIDS drugs that might help patients who would otherwise be unlikely to survive. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has, in fact, responded to that pressure by speeding the approval of the AIDS drug AZT. And on Sept. 28, it announced that it was making a newer AIDS drug, called <ORGANIZATION> DDI </ORGANIZATION>, widely available while tests of its safety and effectiveness are still continuing. Defenders of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> argue the French system has certain drawbacks that would make it unworkable in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The French system is faster `` because it's very different,'' says <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON>, former deputy director of drugs at the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the drug approval process is subject to enormous oversight by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and consumer groups, says <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON>, who is now with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmacopeial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, a private organization that sets standards for drug quality, purity and strength. Some public interest groups are calling for a speed-up in drug approval, <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON> notes, at the same time that others are arguing that the agency takes unnecessary risks by sometimes being too hasty. The classic example of a drug being approved too quickly is thalidomide, which caused severe birth defects after it was approved in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The drug was never approved in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Oversight from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the public interest groups inevitably puts pressure on reviewers and slows down the drug-approval process, <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON> says. Similar government and public oversight does not exist in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` There is hardly ever anybody from the AP or <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> looking over their shoulders,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON>, a clinical pharmacologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who spent the 1980-81 academic year in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> studying its pharmaceutical approval process. `` Our system is much more political.'' Most Americans see that public scrutiny as important, even though it might slow new drug approvals, <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON> says. Nevertheless, he says, there are examples of drugs that get approved here before they get approved in other countries, including some AIDS drugs. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has gone remarkably far in making experimental AIDS drugs available with as little administrative encumbrance as possible,'' <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON> says. The principal difference between the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> and American systems is that while the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> relies on an in-house staff of drug reviewers, the French rely on an outside committee of expert volunteers, says Dr. <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Juillet </PERSON>, director of scientific affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Some of the volunteers are drawn from the drug industry itself. That works well in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Juillet </PERSON> says, but the use of drug company scientists to review drugs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would likely draw allegations of conflict of interest.

 The French expert committee meets every other Friday morning to review pending new drug applications. Individual committee members present written technical reviews of each application and then the committee makes its decisions. In cases in which unusual speed is needed, or in which research results are especially complicated, the health ministry simply invites additional experts to join the committee for a time. `` It does n't cost a lot because people are not paid for that,'' <PERSON> Juillet </PERSON> said in an interview at <LOCATION> Broussais </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where he practices medicine. A decision is generally rendered within a few months after a company sends in its research reports. The health minister rubber-stamps it. `` When I was there, the limit was four months, and I almost never saw anything over four months,'' <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON> says. In contrast, at the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> `` some drugs are quicker than others but by and large it's about 18 months'' for approval after a final application has been submitted, <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON> says. `` In the French system, everything is reviewed within an hour or an hour-and-a-half in one day at one presentation,'' <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON> says. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> also places great emphasis on certain studies considered pivotal in demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of new drugs. The most important thing the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> could learn from the French would be `` not focusing on the so-called pivotal studies, but looking at all the studies and all the data,'' <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON> says. One of the drawbacks of the French system, according to <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON>, is that the health ministry does little until research is complete and the company is ready to ask for approval. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> requires a review of laboratory findings before it will allow a new drug to be tested on humans. The French do n't. Drug companies simply inform the health ministry that human trials are about to begin, and the ministry rarely intervenes. `` They ca n't guide you,'' <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON> says. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> meets regularly with drug companies testing new drugs to advise the companies on what further research is needed for approval. In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, `` there are no contacts between the committee and the companies until the file is through,'' Juillet says. When the file of research data is complete, Juillet, acting as the industry representative, makes the company's case before the committee. `` My mission is to be a witness and defend the companies and give them information if there is a problem,'' he says. French drug companies have a much closer relationship with the health ministry than American companies do with the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON> says, `` because the reviewers do n't work for the government; it's not a ` them-and-us' thing. In contrast, <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> reviewers and drug companies often deeply distrust each other. Company officials charge the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> with dragging its feet, while the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> often blames delays on the inadequacy of the companies' research. Juillet suggests the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> should rely more on outside reviewers. `` I think the open system is a good thing, working with people on the outside,'' he says. Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Leighton </PERSON>, a senior vice-president at <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharpe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Dohme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, says one reason French drug approvals are often faster is that the French have decided that the benefits of speeding new drug approval outweigh the risks. `` They realize there might be a risk,'' he says. `` If you're the first country to approve a drug, you might be the first to see a problem.'' <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON> says history shows, however, that the French have not in fact been subject to more problems with drug side-effects than have Americans. `` We are n't saved from every problem drug, nor are they exposed to every problem drug,'' he says. Although he believes the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has much to learn from the French, <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON> praises the expertise of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s reviewers. `` Everybody respects those people. They're smart, hard-working. ... A lot of countries will allow marketing of the drug once the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> does. `` We are the benchmark, for good or ill.''

 The startling boom of heavy artillery reverberates through the world's highest mountains where for five years <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have been fighting for control of an icy wasteland.

 The Top of the World is the battleground in a largely unknown and undeclared war raging between <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, a war in which wind, snow and ice often take a greater toll than the enemy. At stake is national prestige and possession of the Siachen, a Himalayan wasteland wedged between Pakistan-occupied <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> and territory controlled by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. After more than five years of fighting and artillery duels over what would appear to be a minor issue, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> are trying to end the costly war. Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and Pakistani Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, confident they can do business, are pushing to bury ancient animosities and move their countries into a friendlier era. But while they talk of peace, huge artillery guns continue to boom, each startling blast echoing through the stillness of the cathedral-like mountains. Fifteen years ago few thought it possible to fight, let alone hold ground, for years in the higher reaches of the <LOCATION> Karakoram </LOCATION> mountain range, where lie the Siachen and more than half of the world's 20 tallest peaks. Never had battles been fought for any length of time at heights of up to 4 miles, breathing air that contains less than half the oxygen at sea level and at temperatures that frequently drop to 50 degrees below zero. `` Climb a 21,000-foot mountain anywhere else in the world and you get an award,'' Brig. Gen. V.R. <PERSON> Raghavan </PERSON>, commander of the Indian troops, told foreign journalists flown to the base camp at the mouth of the Siachen and then taken by helicopter up the 45-mile-long, 6-mile-wide glacier. The number of casualties on both sides remains a military secret, although <PERSON> Raghavan </PERSON> estimated only one-third are actually due to combat. `` There are natural limits to this conflict _ the weather and the terrain,'' he said. `` Here one has to fight constantly and even more doggedly to survive. So much depends on so few and death can be just one false move away.'' The conflict's roots can be traced to the 1947 partition of Moslem <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which is predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION>. Both countries have coveted the 85,000 square miles of <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION>, a predominantly Moslem state that acceded to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The dispute led <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to grab about one-third of the territory. In 1949, the two countries signed an agreement that drew a cease-fire line that stopped at the southern foot of the Saltoro range running along the glacier's western edge toward the Chinese border. Negotiators did not extend the line because there was no fighting in the region and glaciers were difficult to demarcate. Although there were minor adjustments following the 1965 and 1971 India-Pakistan wars, the question of Siachen was left unresolved. Almost from the beginning, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has said it is entitled to control all of <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, however, says it has controlled the Siachen all along, citing mountaineering expeditions that for years sought its permission to enter and atlases published in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in the early 1980s that showed the area under its control. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> first deployed troops to the Siachen in April 1984, a move it said was merely to pre-empt a planned Pakistani strike. <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> denied the charge. The conflict slowly escalated, with each side deploying thousands of soldiers, erecting outposts and setting up bigger, more powerful artillery. In the winter of 1987, Indian troops abandoned a 20,000-foot outpost on <LOCATION> Bilaford </LOCATION>, one of three key passes. When they returned in the spring and found the Pakistanis had moved in, a fierce six-day battle ensued, with both sides pounding the other with artillery. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> retaliated three months later with its biggest strike of the war, capturing one post and closing in on a second before the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> unleashed an artillery barrage.

 `` The secret to this conflict is to control the high ground, and we do. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is on the lower slopes, and we can punish them whenever necessary,'' <PERSON> Raghavan </PERSON> said as 130mm artillery guns fired, reverberating through the canyons. `` We have just given them our reply for firing at one of our posts.'' Indian soldiers posted on the peaks and ridges keep watch day and night for the other side's supply and patrols columns. It is a lonely existence for the soldiers, most of whom come from the palm-fringed beaches of southern <LOCATION> Kerala </LOCATION> state or the desert of western <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION> or the jungles of eastern <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> and have never lived _ much less fought in _ a snowbound environment. `` This is the hardest place on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Modhival </PERSON> <PERSON> Iqbal </PERSON>, a weary 23-year-old soldier who just completed four months of duty at a 19,000-foot outpost. From the base camp, soldiers armed with ice picks, skis, shovels, ropes and 65-pound backpacks trudge across the black moraine, through knee-deep snow and over 200-foot crevasses and up the walls of ice to their posts. But before leaving, each visits the cave-like enclave where there are hung images of the Hindu gods <PERSON> Rama </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Shiva </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ganesha </PERSON>, as well as a portrait of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>. `` Everybody who goes to the glacier comes here first and says his prayers. It does n't matter if he's Hindu or Moslem or Christian,'' <PERSON> Raghavan </PERSON> said. The trek takes six to eight days, with brief rest stops at posts along the way, before reaching the small outposts where the soldiers live for months in bunkers dug deep in the snow. `` Every day up there is important because every day you survive means you're one day closer to leaving,'' <PERSON> Iqbal </PERSON> said. `` It's not just the Pakistanis. It's the blizzards, the howling winds, the blinding glare of the sun off the snow. It's the avalanches and the isolation. `` We have plenty of food and supplies, but not much else. Maybe someday somebody will organize a society for the prevention of cruelty to soldiers.'' A month-long clash erupted in April when <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> allegedly tried to establish a new post within easy firing range of the Indians and both sides dispatched soldiers to an icy 21,300-foot peak. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, however, said it had only discovered an old observation post. Accounts of what happened differ, but the Indians apparently requested a meeting between the two opposition commanders. After three sessions both sides agreed to pull back and the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> agreed to accept the post the Pakistanis had said was there all along. With <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> commanding most of the heights along the <LOCATION> Saltoro </LOCATION>, it now wants that boundary to serve as the northern extension of the line that divides most of <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Since January 1986, the two governments have met five times to discuss withdrawing their troops from the glacier and to consider declaring the region a demilitarized zone. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> officials believe the eventual withdrawal of <LOCATION> Indiain </LOCATION> troops would be a major victory for Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and a vindication of their position that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> started the conflict by sending troops into an undemarcated area. Both Pakistani and Indian officials say the rapport between <LOCATION> Gandhi </LOCATION> and Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> is helping but it still may be difficult for either to yield. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> is only months away from facing a national election. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> is in an even stickier situation, facing criticism at home from opposition leaders who accuse her of submission to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. While their leaders struggle to find a political solution, both sides contend they can hold out indefinitely. `` Whether there is a settlement is a matter between state and state,'' <PERSON> Raghavan </PERSON> said. `` Until then, we have a job to do. That does n't mean we want to stay here forever. Who would? But we can stay here as long as we have to.''

 <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> is trying to preserve its colonial heritage and intimate scale while riding into the 21st century on a bulldozer. Office towers are going up, and up. Old ones are coming down or being remodeled. Elevated roads are going underground. The water in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> is on its way to the cleaners. Take a walk and see. The heart of downtown <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> still beats along narrow streets lit by gas lamps and threaded between 19th century brick buildings. Out along the <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, boulevards of the Back Bay repeat this image on a grander scale with tall, graceful row houses built with bay windows and front yards framed by cast-iron fences. But rising beside this embrace of the past are elegant 20th century buildings that blend <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s antiquity with the pride of new money. Stroll out to <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>'s Wharf. Built on the ruins of a pier, the hotel and condominium complex is graced by an immense open archway to the harbor. Though just a few years old, admirers often assume the handsome building is a well-preserved old masterpiece. Amble through the nearby financial district. Renovators dusted off art deco embellishments on the buildings. Whimsical gold-leaf accents climbing up the granite face sparkle on a new office tower at 75 State St. Take a ride on the subway to any number of remodeled train stations turned into vaulted cathedrals of glass and steel. Stand on a tree-shaded corner of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Public </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION>, a park evocative of the city's British roots, and gaze at a brick-and-glass palace of condominiums. Called Heritage on the Park, this new building's towers and wings blend so artfully with its authentically aged surroundings it might have been there all along. Conventioneers no longer visit the cramped and forgettable Hynes Auditorium. There is a new bolder structure that sits long and low with a grandeur more appropriate to a city that acknowledges its power and ambitions. More than the skyline is in upheaval. Downtown in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, top-of-the line department stores occupy shining new towers of commerce that cater to the city's new wealth in its shift from industry to a service economy. The mannequins in the windows of Bonwit Teller and <ORGANIZATION> Neiman-Marcus </ORGANIZATION> reach to the new upper class with outstretched arms clad in designer fashions. Gritty <LOCATION> Charlestown </LOCATION>, home to historic <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and witness to racial violence when busing forced the integration of schools 15 years ago, is attracting affluent professionals. Working-class natives are less than comfortable with the gentrified air these newcomers bring. The once-vibrant Combat Zone is dying. A district that offered X-rated films and strip shows to soldiers in wartime and to business conventioneers more recently is coming down. Coming in are refined office condominiums. In the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION>, streets of stately row houses were claimed long ago by a rich racial and economic mix of people. New moneyed people, largely young and white, see in those homes an upscale neighborhood waiting to happen. Renewed efforts to integrate public housing in mostly white <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> are forcing residents there to accept neighbors they never dreamed of seeing across the fence. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> has undergone change, whether from fire or changes in the economic climate, since the Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackstone </PERSON> settled on the side of <LOCATION> Beacon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> in 1630 and cleared paths that jokesters later said followed the route of his cow's wanderings. The city's current effort to remake itself began in the mid-1970s. The churning, crashing and dust have been accelerating ever since. `` A living city is never finished,'' says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redevelopment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant director for urban design and development. `` Zoning is the principal tool of the city to implement its policies. This is done with an eye to preserving the city's intimate scale while accommodating the pressures of economic vitality and growth To date, a staggering 1,872 projects have been logged in the authority's computer since 1975. In that time, the city has added or restored 59.4 million square feet in floor space, from office suites and hotel rooms to housing and parking lots. The price tag, in current dollars, rings up $ 14.4 billion. Major projects currently under way or on the drafting table include: _ Midtown Cultural District This 20-block expansion of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s tiny theater district would also overtake the Combat Zone

 _ Downtown Crossing The city's chief shopping district is slated for the biggest retail project in city history. Developers intend to spend $ 600 million tearing down a mediocre and claustrophobic 4-year-old mall that looks more like a fortress than a shopping arcade and replace it with a larger complex of department stores and office space. _ Depression of the Central Artery This $ 4.5 billion job that sounds like an unhappy medical procedure threatens to make life miserable for motorists and businesses alike. The project, scheduled for 1990 to 1998, will lower the major six-lane elevated highway in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and make it an underground expressway. It also would add a tunnel under <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. Numerous other office and residential towers and projects are planned. The New England Aquarium wants to move to <LOCATION> Charlestown </LOCATION>. A new federal courthouse is proposed at Government Center. The <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> is slated to be replaced with a bigger and better sports complex. The Prudential Center, which in the 1960s was in the avant-garde of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s new look, is set for a makeover. The city involves not only developers and planners in its grand designs but neighborhood groups, affected property owners and history lovers. `` It's no more random development; it's calculated, managed growth,'' says <PERSON> Antonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollak </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium of 33 preservation and historic societies. `` We have learned how to protect and manage good architecture. Not the character of 1630, but the character of contemporary <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>: a combination of colonial, <LOCATION> Victorian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> with new state-of-the-art structures.'' `` This is a nation that has always loved change,'' said architect and developer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Madsen </PERSON>, who is on the board of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Architects </ORGANIZATION>, one of many groups guiding the city in its constant transformation. For <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to cease changing would take a cataclysm affecting its widely diverse economy, a cornucopia of education, finance, medicine, legal and other professional services and corporate headquarters, he said. But for others, the handsome changes can be dizzying and discomfitting. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunha </PERSON> is a 36-year-old machinist and a third-generation resident of <LOCATION> Charlestown </LOCATION>. Like many of his fellow <LOCATION> Charlestown </LOCATION> residents, <PERSON> Cunha </PERSON> is learning to adjust to life with the `` Toonies.'' That's the derisive name locals give the moneyed people who began moving in after 1975, when an elevated train came down and property values went up. `` <LOCATION> Charlestown </LOCATION> is n't a neighborhood of generations anymore,'' <PERSON> Cunha </PERSON> says. In the not-too-distant olden days, <PERSON> Charlestowners </PERSON> married each other, he says. Their offspring grew up and began <LOCATION> Charlestown </LOCATION> families of their own. `` A lot of the people who own places here now do n't raise families, they raise pets, plants and Porsches,'' <PERSON> Cunha </PERSON> says. The concerns of new people in the racial and economically diverse South End seem to be getting more selfish, says <PERSON> Jeanette </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>, who works in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> office of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>. She's troubled by the trend. `` The problem I have is when you move into a neighborhood that has a history and people decide they want to change it, not having a regard for it. They want to move the suburb into the city.'' A homeowner for six years, Ms. <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> fondly remembers the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION> she first encountered. `` When we first moved to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION>, we were friendly and people talked to us. Now, half the people you see would n't give you the time of day. `` It was a neighborhood that had low-income blacks, Hispanics and whites _ basically people who lived together and tried to get along,'' Ms. <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> says. `` With some of the changes, people have no regard for the rich history. We're finding a generation of people who are not as caring, who care more about ` my space' ... People of all colors, all races, all kinds, have a right to live in a neighborhood. It makes a neighborhood a lot richer.'' Architecture critic and author <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and now lives in the <LOCATION> Back </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, where 20 years ago the distinctive brick row houses were rooming houses, not small showcases for the up-and-coming. `` I do n't find the changes heartwarming,'' she said, referring to the new demography. `` The diversity is evaporating. It's becoming a city of the rich and the poor `` I do n't mean it was a kinder, gentler city, if you'll pardon the expression ... But you would n't have seen $ 3,000 suits on the street.''

 <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> paints mystical `` windows to heaven,'' he says, haunting religious icons used as vehicles of prayer. `` Icons are a very important part of the church,'' <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> says. `` They are a spiritual and physical depiction of some sacred image _ of Christ or the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, a saint or some other liturgical happening.'' Icons, popular in the Eastern Orthodox Church, are painted in rich, luminous colors. Faces are depicted with prayerful expressions, and religious figures usually are crowned with halos of real gold, not gold paint. Perpective and scale are distorted to give the religious scenes a supernatural feel. Some regard icons simply as products of religious devotion or art inspired by the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which began the tradition centuries ago. The religious regard icons as `` windows to heaven'' or `` theology made visible'' and believe focusing on them deepens prayer and meditation, <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>, 36, of nearby <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION>, has been teaching two-week classes in icon painting since last summer at <LOCATION> Antiochian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, an Orthodox cultural center outside this mountain community about 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. The village, and the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sacred </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, are the only schools in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> offering classes in icon painting. <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> says there are about 90 iconographers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Students must learn to create within the strict conventions of the art. They eventually develop their own styles while absorbing hundreds of details on symbolism used in icons. For instance, halos _ blazing disks of golden light _ are applied in gold leaf around the heads of divine figures to depict emanations of radiant light. `` They are auras of spiritual holiness. Icons depict not just a person's earthly image, but a spritual-type image as well,'' <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> says. `` There is no light source like in other art. The light source comes from within the figure.'' Anatomical details such as facial features, fingers and body shapes are stylized to give figures an additional aura of the supernatural. Scenes are painted in two dimensions and no shadows are cast. `` That's why in iconography, the icons do not look like real people,'' <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> says. `` We're not trying to make them look like real people. It's a symbolic representation of a person.'' Certain colors are associated with some religious figures. Christ, for example, usually is depicted in blue and red. `` You usually never depict <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> in green,'' <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> says. `` It's not traditional.'' Iconographers say they technically do not paint icons, but `` write'' them. Artists are taught to create their works with thousands of tiny caligraphic strokes. `` What they are are scriptural pictures _ pictures of the scriptures,'' <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> says. `` When you write the icon, you're writing scriptures just the same as when you are using words. Although the mechanics of the art are important, theology debates often erupt during class sessions. `` It's very, very, very theological,'' <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> says. `` There's a lot of rules attached to this _ not a lot of painting rules, but a whole lot of rules on what's proper, what's liturgical, what's not liturgical Interest in icon painting has increased dramatically in recent years, and not just among the religious. `` People here in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> are just beginning to discover the art of the Orthodox church,'' <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> says. `` It's not just something <PERSON> Grandma </PERSON> brought over from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>.'' `` I think the whole interest in religion is coming back,'' says <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>, an official of the School of Sacred Arts. `` For a long time people were looking to Eastern religions and Eastern mysticism. While that's still popular, people are returning to their own traditions now.'' <PERSON> Iconographer </PERSON> <PERSON> Vladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON>, who was born in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, offers a 14-week class at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> school, which also offers classes on the art traditions of other religions. `` It's pretty international and we sell out every time. We usually limit classes to 10 students,'' he says. `` Many of the arts we teach are not available elsewhere.'' Classes offered in the subject are short-term, but it often takes years to develop competence, says <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papas </PERSON>, 30, an iconographer from nearby <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. `` When I first started I was very timid and self-conscious,'' he says. `` I was pretentious, boxed in and stiff. I feel that it took me years to even begin to break out of that. I feel like I'm still breaking out of that.'' Papas began painting icons in 1979 and started full-time work as an iconographer in 1982. Papas sells notebook-size icons of a favorite subject, such as portraits of Christ, for as little as $ 175, but bigger and more complicated works can be worth thousands of dollars. `` Every iconographer has his own idea of what he should get for an icon,'' he says. Papas' icons usually are sold to churches or people who display them in their homes. A giant mural of his is displayed 30 feet above the ground in the dome of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Byzantine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Homer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. A 70 - by 12-foot mural Papas currently is working on, `` The Communion of the Apostles,'' will attempt to depict what heaven looks like The idea of selling icons to people who admire them only as works of art is a sticky ethical problem for some iconographers who fear the buyer would be misusing a holy object. `` I would feel uncomfortable, but I would do it,'' says <PERSON> Papas </PERSON>, who was born to an Eastern Orthodox family. `` Even if a person asked me for an icon for the wrong reason, there's a possibility that the icon could be a good influence on them.'' <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> began painting icons 18 years ago, while studying to be an art teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>. An iconographer who served as the choir director of one local Orthodox church recruited him and several of his college friends to help him with his work. `` We made his job a little easier by filling in colors and stuff like that,'' <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> says. Also during college, <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> decided to leave the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> to become an Eastern Orthodox Christian. `` I was always interested in religion, always interested in exploring other religions as well,'' he says. `` I felt the Orthodox Church was very satisfying. I felt this church has so much to offer liturgically, spiritually, musically, artistically _ everything.''

 <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> did n't set out to become an actor, but now that he's become quite successful at the age of 13 he'd like to stick to it. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON>, who was nominated for an Emmy for his lead role in <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s hit comedy series `` The Wonder Years'' but did n't win, is a video game hustler in the upcoming December release `` The Wizard. `` I never really wanted to get into the business,'' he says. `` It was never a goal. It just happened.'' It happened when he began doing commercials at the age of 6 in his hometown of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where he lives with his family when he's not working He made his film debut at 8 in the movie `` The Boy Who Could Fly.'' `` I really enjoy acting,'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> says, now that he is a veteran performer. `` I'd like to continue it for a while. I do want to go to high school and college. I'd like to direct. On the set they call me ` Little Opie,' because <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> started as a child actor and grew up to direct. He could be a role model for me. I'm always looking through the camera and checking angles. I want to learn all I can.'' `` The Wonder Years'' is the kind of show that will grow with <PERSON> Fred </PERSON>. It made its debut in March 1988, and it has already changed to reflect that <PERSON> Fred </PERSON>, as <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, is maturing and facing different problems and challenges. `` The beauty of the show is that when my voice changes I can still do the show,'' he says. `` Even if I get zits.'' The beauty is also that virtually everyone can identify with the adolescent traumas of <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> and their friends. The time period this season has advanced to 1969, but its stories and characters transcend time and place. `` I see <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> as just a typical kid growing up in the late 1960s,'' he says. `` He's very shy. He has a non-stop fear of the men in his family. His older brother's always beating up on him and everyone's afraid of his dad. `` He's sort of insecure, especially around girls. But I think he's a cool kid. He's a normal kid in 1969. This year he moves into the eighth grade and has trouble with algebra and the algebra teacher. This year his older brother learns to drive.'' His favorite episode is the one in which <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> accompanies his father to his office. `` It's so true,'' he says. `` The exact thing did n't happen to me but I went to my dad's office. I was so impressed watching him work. I'd bring books to the office and copy the whole book on the copy machine.'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON>, accompanied by his mother, is late for an interview. He explains he had to complete work with his tutor for the public school he attends in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. He also explains that his father, who's an industrial real estate broker, is back in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` But they're not divorced,'' he quickly adds. They're merely temporarily apart because of the requirements of his role on `` The Wonder Years.'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> has a younger sister, <PERSON> Kala </PERSON>, and a brother, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON>, who appeared with him in his latest movie, `` Little Monsters.'' In `` The Wizard,'' he and his younger brother head for a video game championship. `` They're heading from <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> to the game in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> says. `` They make money hustling other kids to play video games. Their father's looking for them and their mother hires a kind of bounty hunter.'' The movie also stars <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Slater </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> first got into acting when notices in his <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> neighborhood asked for small children to audition for a television commercial. `` The auditions were near our house and it sounded like fun,'' he says. `` So Mom and I went over. I did n't get it and six months later the same director held another audition. I did n't get it again. Six months later the director called and I was cast in a Pac Man vitamins commercial. `` I did commercials for about two years, then I got into movies. I did quite a few and I was in a TV series called ` Morning Star, Evening Star.' It only lasted six weeks. `` I was called in to read for ` The Wonder Years' because the producers had seen me in the movie ` Vice Versa.' I flew to <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> and read for the network. I guess they approved because I got the part. They ran the pilot after the Super Bowl in 1988 and we went on the air in March.'' The show won the Emmy last year as best comedy series after just half of a season on the air. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> never saw the Emmy telecast because he was asleep when the show came on. He was in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> making the movie `` Little Monsters.'' His mother would n't let him stay up This year he was not only nominated as best lead actor in a comedy, making him the youngest person ever nominated in a lead role, but he was an award presenter with <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON>.

 Before he returned to Broadway for the first time in 25 years, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> wondered whether audiences would forget television's <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Unger </PERSON> long enough to accept him as the tormented protagonist of `` M. Butterfly.'' After all, <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> was <PERSON> Felix </PERSON>, the fussy, fastidious half of `` The Odd Couple,'' for five years on prime time television as well as in nine stage productions with four different <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Madisons </PERSON>, including his TV co-star, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Klugman </PERSON>. `` That question came up a million times,'' <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> recalled the other day. `` Would they want to laugh instead?'' He need not have worried. `` There's not a moment of rejection and having to win them over,'' he says now, talking about his performance as <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallimard </PERSON>, the French diplomat who has an affair with a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> opera singer. And theatergoers go along willingly with the more bizarre plot developments in <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hwang </PERSON>'s Tony award-winning play. <PERSON> Gallimard </PERSON> is seduced by the singer who turns out to be a man masquerading as a woman. `` But then director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> has set up the play so that when the first voice comes out of this miasma of light and movement and music, the audience is already captivated,'' the actor says. `` He's the only director I ever worked with in my life who I thought was a genius. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> is one of those actors who's not afraid of opinions. Asked why it has been more than 25 years since he has appeared on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>, he says, `` No one's asked me. `` I've frequently had a year off or more and have noised it around town that I was available. The fact that a man is a Broadway producer does n't make him any more intelligent than a network executive.'' Not that he has n't been on stage during this time. Last year, there was a <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON> farce done at the Paper Mill Playhouse in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, and he has worked for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Neville </PERSON>'s theater company in <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION> as well as in all those tours of `` The Odd Couple.'' `` ` The Odd Couple' is a masterpiece,'' he states matter-of-factly. `` The laughs just roll in. But you have to play it as if it's ` Hamlet' _ very, very seriously. `` Any play that is good has some ideological basis behind it. In ` The Odd Couple,' it's male bonding. The play is very chauvinistic and anti-feminist. The only women in it are two dingbats, and the men hate their wives. The only happiness these men have is when they are away from their wives.'' <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> has worked in just about every medium except burlesque. Last year when he was honored at the <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>, four videocassette machines simultaneously unspooled `` The Odd Couple,'' `` The <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Show </PERSON>,'' `` Love, <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON>'' and `` Mr. Peepers,'' the four television series he has done. `` There was my life on the screen,'' he recalls. `` You could watch me go bald.'' Bits and pieces of <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>'s story also are told in `` Which Reminds Me,'' a collection of show business anecdotes he has gathered during his more than 40 years as an actor. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, who says he's `` cursed with almost total recall,'' wrote the book in collaboration with and at the urging of a good friend, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mindlin </PERSON>, an advertising executive and movie publicity man. It arrives in bookstores in November from <ORGANIZATION> Delacorte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, fresh out of <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Olka </LOCATION>., and one year at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in the early 1940s His first Broadway show was <PERSON> Thorton </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s `` The Skin of Our Teeth'' in 1942. Well, almost. He was drafted into the Army the second day of rehearsals. Four years later, <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where he found a lot of work on radio and a few small parts in the theater. But he did n't _ and still does n't _ think much of radio work. `` It was nothing,'' <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> recalls. `` Standing there reading a script. What was that? And the script, for the most part, was dreck. It probably had been written that morning. How could you act? You had one rehearsal and you were on the air.'' <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> had better luck _ and better parts _ on television, beginning in 1952, when he appeared as English teacher <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Weskitt </PERSON> in `` Mr. Peepers,'' one of the best of the early TV sitcoms. His big break on Broadway came in 1955 in `` Inherit the Wind,'' a retelling of the Scopes trial in which he played a reporter modeled after H.L. <PERSON> Mencken </PERSON>. The play propelled him to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> for scores of movies, including three <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Day-Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> classics, `` Pillow Talk,'' `` Lover Come Back'' and `` Send Me No Flowers,'' as well as other films like `` Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?'' and `` The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao.'' The 69-year-old <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> admits he was a little frightened about returning to Broadway in a play as physically demanding as `` M. Butterfly.'' `` That's what I thought would kill me,'' he says. `` Moving around like that and the knowledge that my predecessor -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> -RRB- had lost 25 pounds. And he was a young guy. They had to get new costumes for him. `` But I was at the doctor's this morning with my wife and I've gained weight. Memorizing was an easy part of the job, <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> says. He had four weeks of rehearsal before going on in `` M. Butterfly,'' and director <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> came back for a week to work with him. `` A replacement does n't have that much option really,'' <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> says. `` The first three weeks of rehearsal, he just works with the stage manager who takes him through the established staging. If he wants to change anything he can, but it's foolish. The stage is lighted. Everything is set. If you want to move here instead of there, that means they have to change the lights. It's not worth it.'' Actually, he adds, playing in `` The Odd Couple'' was more tiring than `` M. Butterfly.'' `` But the role of Oscar is harder than <PERSON> Felix </PERSON>. Oscar is a killer,'' he says of other half of `` The Odd Couple.'' `` I do n't think I could play Oscar too well. Although when I went into this play, a half dozen people asked me what part I'm playing,'' <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> laughs `` I do n't see myself as the young Chinese girl. `` I think it's ` The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao.' They know I played an Oriental in that movie.''

 <LOCATION> TAIPEI </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> _ Forty years after <PERSON> Generalissimo </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON> and his Nationalist Chinese arrived in defeat from the mainland, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> is prosperous _ the world's 13th largest trading nation _ and democracy is beginning to take hold. But in 1949, with <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>' Communists in control of mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the outlook for the Chinese Nationalists on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> was bleak. Not only had they been routed from their homeland, they faced a restive Taiwanese population that viewed <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> and his 2 million or so followers as an occupying force. The Nationalists prevailed, nevertheless, by dint of authoritarian rule and clinging to their contention, supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western nations, that they were the legitimate rulers of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In the years since, firmly guided economic policies have transformed <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> into the economic success it is now as the island approaches its national day Oct. 10 _ Double Ten, for the tenth day of the tenth month. With prosperity at its peak and people demanding greater freedoms, the Nationalists have begun to loosen their authoritarian grip, slowly bringing democracy to the island of 20 million and permitting contacts with the rival Communist Chinese for the first time since the civil war on the mainland. `` Many people used to be disappointed with the government and tried to emigrate whenever they had the chance,'' said <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ya-li </PERSON>, political science professor of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taiwan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` They now feel there is some hope and have begun to care and criticize.'' An agrarian economy based on rice and sugar production has given way to the manufacturing of textiles, electronic products and machinery. The formula was capitalism mixed with government policies designed to stimulate selected industries. While the Nationalists controlled major monopolies, many of the light-industry factories were family-run operations that helped spread the wealth around the island. Annual per capita income rose from $ 50 in 1949 to $ 5,512 last year. Gross national product soared from $ 1.2 billion 40 years ago to $ 119 billion in 1988. Exports led the way, with foreign trade jumping from $ 300 million in 1952 to $ 110 billion last year. So much foreign exchange has poured in that the island's coffers bulge with $ 74 billion in reserves. Prosperity is everywhere on the streets of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>. Porsche and BMW automobiles snake through the congested streets, fancy restaurants are on almost every block and the latest electronic gadgets fill store windows. Indeed, <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, the island's capital, seems to lack nothing. Except foreign embassies. While the island advanced on economic successes, it faced bitter diplomatic defeats as the world recognized the Communist Chinese government in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Only 24 countries, mostly tiny island nations and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries, still recognize <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> diplomatically, down from 50 in 1949. The Communist Chinese government has formal ties with 135 countries. The toughest blow came in 1978, when <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s major ally, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, announced it was cutting diplomatic links and setting up formal relations with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dismantled its military bases on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and said military aid would not increase in quantity or quality. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market did not close to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and that helped assure its economic health. <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng-chien </PERSON>, a leading opposition politician, blamed <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s diplomatic isolation on the `` dream of a reunified <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'' ruled by a Nationalist government. The Nationalists also used that dream in their efforts to justify their monopoly on political power and the harsh quelling of dissent. The Nationalists placed <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> under martial law and refused to allow rival political parties or an opposition press. Critics who traveled overseas often were not allowed back; many of those who stayed in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> were thrown in jail. By claiming to be the rightful ruler of all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the Nationalists insisted that native Taiwanese, who comprise about 80 percent of the population, could not replace any of the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and electoral college who had been elected in mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> before the civil war defeat. But as the Taiwanese prospered economically they demanded more political rights. It was <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>'s son, the late President <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON>, who finally launched the political liberalization the Nationalists needed if they were to maintain popular support. In 1987, <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON> lifted martial law, which paved the way for the formation of opposition political parties. Some media restrictions were erased, leading to a more critical press. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> residents were allowed to visit relatives on the Chinese mainland, bringing a more relaxed attitude toward the Communists.

 Demonstrations became an almost daily occurrence, with Taiwanese taking to the streets to protest everything from prostitution to pollution. By the following year, it became apparent that the gradual liberalizing trend would not easily be reversed. When <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-kuo </PERSON> died in January 1988, he was succeeded by Vice President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON>, the first native Taiwanese to lead the Nationalist government and a supporter of democratic reform. Six months later, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was named chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and some, but not all, aging hardliners from the mainland retired from top party posts. The Nationalist leadership under <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> has proposed a gradual increase in the percentage of the Legislature that is elected on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Still, only less than half the seats will be contested in Dec. 2 elections, making it impossible for the opposition to wrest any real political power from the Nationalists. `` We are fully committed to democratization,'' government spokesman <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu-ming </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` We are moving slowly but surely to meet the demands of the time.'' But <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> still has problems: _ Rising wages and an appreciating currency: These have made <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> less competitive in low-cost exports and the government is seeking a new economic formula to deal with the problem `` We must actively push forward the research of top-notch industrial technologies,'' Premier <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Huan </PERSON> recently told the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. `` The service sector should also grow quicker to become the center of our future economic development.'' _ Pollution caused by years of rapid development: <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>'s air is foul and the island's rivers are filthy Some villagers have protested the construction of new factories they fear will ruin the local environment. _ Gambling and speculation: Gambling is illegal but rampant, and speculating in the stock market has become the national pastime The <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> stock exchange is second only to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s in trading volume, and some analysts believe it is a speculative bubble waiting to burst. Some see the obsession as a temporary phenomenon following the easing of foreign exchange controls in 1987. Others argue that industrialists are more interested in quick profit than in longterm investment, such as automating factories and developing more sophisticated products. Perhaps the greatest challenge facing <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> is its policy toward mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Official policy remains the `` three no's'' _ no contact, no negotiations, no compromise with the Communists. But that policy today is a shambles. The government allows trade with the mainland if conducted through a third party such as <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, and Taiwanese businessmen have begun investing in the mainland to take advantage of low labor costs. Finance Minister <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuo </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in May to attend an <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> meeting and met privately with Communist officials. The future of such contacts is somewhat clouded because of the Communists' violent suppression of the democracy movement this past spring. But the old Nationalist dream of returning to rule the mainland seems shattered. When the Chinese Communist government seemed in disarray during the spring democracy movement, the Nationalists were forced to acknowledge there was not much they could do but watch. `` We must have the courage to face the fact that at this moment we are unable to effectively exercise the right to govern the mainland,'' President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> told a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> leaders on June 3.

 <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, the last place on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> where nature reigns over man, is facing a showdown between those who want to tap its fabled wealth and those who want it to remain forever untouched under ice. The majestic continent at the bottom of the world, larger than <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> combined, is still peopled by scant thousands who have to import everything but ice cubes. Although 16 nations fly flags in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, and seven claim slices of it, no one holds title. No one needs a passport. It is a vast global common, ruled only by the harsh, unforgiving elements. But statesmen, scientists and environmentalists must decide soon whether <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> will open up to oilmen and airmen, miners, commercial fishermen, hotelkeepers and, possibly, colonists. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, beginning Monday, 33 nations will review the 1959 Antarctic Treaty that expires in 1991. They also will examine the remains of the <ORGANIZATION> Antarctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, signed in May 1988. The convention would have allowed controlled mining and oil exploration, replacing a voluntary moratorium. But <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, one of seven claimant nations with a veto, decided not to ratify it. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, among others, are pressing for a minerals accord. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, echoing <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s concerns, wants <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> to be an unspoiled world park Delegates were guarded over an eventual compromise. The 1988 convention took six years to negotiate. Proponents say a world short of resources has no choice. <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> hoards unknown quantities of gold, platinum and other strategic metals, along with oil in amounts estimated to be in the billions of barrels. Detractors insist that even controlled exploitation inevitably pollutes a reserve crucial to man's survival. Upsetting its delicate balance, they say, will have consequences no one can predict. Undeniably, the world is already muscling in. Penguin livers are tainted with pesticides and plastics. Century-old garbage litters pristine panoramas. <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> has had its first oil spill. `` Trash thrown into the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> will eventually settle in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>,'' the French oceanographer <PERSON> Jacques-Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON> once told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` The world is a closed system.'' In a more recent interview, he railed against plans to exploit the last untamed place on earth. `` That would be almost criminal, at least stupid,'' he said. `` It would be a catastrophe.'' Scientists worry that tourists, whose numbers now approach 10,000 a year, endanger fragile ecosystems. Huge ice floes menace ships' hulls, adding a threat of oil pollution. Yet it is the ancient lure of the mysterious continent, largely unexplored for all of history's daring expeditions, that make it such a disputed prize. <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> is 98 percent under ice, but it is no more a white continent than <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is a dark one. Old ice grows blue, then rich turquoise. As the sun shifts its angle over floating ice and the glacier beyond, <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> is aglow in pinks and oranges beyond the range of film or canvas. Penguin colonies, like rush-hour crowds dressed in black tie, amuse scientists who try to take them seriously. Seals frolic and birds move from place to place in turbulent clouds. For all the beauty, arguments focus on survival of the planet. President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, making the case for a world wilderness area, told scientists from 40 countries at a June meeting: `` It's not just the forests, the prairies or rivers that are in danger. It's the entire Earth.'' Specialists regard <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> as the world's weather factory. For 10 years, scientists there have measured the Earth's thinning ozone layer, letting through radiation that risks catastrophic changes in world climate and ocean levels A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> team recently reported the ozone hole over <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> was much more serious than previously believed. <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON> warns that jostling the precarious balance invites calamity. For example, just scraping the surface of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> spreads dust that alters reflectivity, raising temperatures and melting ice. Human activity disturbs the breeding of unique species of birds and marine mammals, scientists say. Fishing threatens a delicate food chain that depends upon plentiful supplies of krill, a tiny shrimp. In <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, with treacherous sea lanes and lashing winds, accidents are common. Once damage is done, experience shows, it is very difficult to correct.

 Man on the frozen continent requires steady supply. The fauna is all but inedible. Even penguin eggs are too greasy for breakfast. The plants are minuscule lichens. And what comes in must be carried out. Travelers today find Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Falcon </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s hut as he left it in 1911, with unrusted tins of <ORGANIZATION> Huntley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>'s biscuits lined up on dust-free shelves. Cold, clean air preserves almost anything. Environmentalists rage at garbage dumps that accompany a lengthening string of military and scientific outposts, including the sprawling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> McMurdo Station. The <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> environmentalist group set up a base near <LOCATION> McMurdo </LOCATION> to monitor developments. Its members came to blows with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> soldiers building a runway across from a penguin rookery near the South Magnetic Pole. The group accuses the Americans, among others, of killing marine life with sewage and refuse. If scientists can not protect the environment, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> argues, oilmen and miners will be worse. Near the end of September, word filtered out that 44,000 gallons of diesel fuel leaked from a pipe at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Amundsen-Scott Station at the South Pole. The leak was discovered in August. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said it would seep into the ice with no environmental damage. But Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gareth </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> called it a perfect example of why <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> had to be protected. In the early 1970s, when politics heated in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, claimant nations hurried to strengthen their positions. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> leased a Greek ship, with deck chairs but no radar, for cut-rate tourism. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> built a hotel. Last year, the first commercial flights landed at the South Pole. Now Australian entrepreneurs propose `` Project Oasis'' _ a runway for 747 jet aircraft, a five-story hotel and a hovercraft dock. When the mineral convention was signed, some specialists argued that controlled exploitation was better than no accord at all. If anyone broke the moratorium, no international law would apply. Ideas included carrying out oil in submarines, rather than tankers, to minimize risk. But the picture changed in January when an Argentine supply ship, the <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION>, nosed into waters marked on charts `` dangerous ledges and channels'' and tore open its double hull. The crew and all 81 tourists escaped, but an estimated 170,000 gallons of its 250,000 gallons of fuel oil leaked onto marine habitats, eventually killing seals, penguins and other marine life. Salvage crews were able to stop the leakage but oil still remains in the ship's tanks. The Argentine navy reported after a reconnaissance flight over the area in early September that the <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION> is still aground in ice-free waters and listing at about 140 degrees. Capt. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Pueyrredon </PERSON> of the Argentine navy said the airmen `` saw no evidence of leakage nor any visible ecological damage.'' He added that he was not sure how much oil remained in the vessel but that `` it was very little.'' In a letter to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> in May, the Environmental Defense Fund, an American organization that describes itself as non-profit, said the <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION> still had about 70,000 gallons of fuel on board when the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION> winter set in and still poses a threat to <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>'s environment. `` <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>'s worst environmental disaster has become a forgotten oil spill,'' the letter said.

 Differences over what is and what is not Islam lies at the heart of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s 10-year war. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has been attempting to deflate his foes' main rallying cry _ that his Marxist-based <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> is a pack of godless Soviet stooges _ by transplanting the party's ideology into the country's Islamic heritage. But many Afghans hold deep suspicions that the party is rooted in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> next door. The assault on Islam by <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s predecessors has not been forgotten Islam is the one link the violently competitive Afghan tribes all share. Being recognized as a good Moslem is an ironclad form of acceptance. Doubt in the leaders' faith is strongest among the Shiite Moslem minority known as the Hazara. They make up about 17 percent of the 16 million Afghans, 99 percent of whom are Moslems. The Sunni sect is the overwhelming majority. Hundreds of thousands of Hazara live in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, but most inhabit the mountains at the country's center, an area known as <LOCATION> Hazarajat </LOCATION>. The government has little control there, but the <PERSON> Hazara </PERSON> rejected a government offer of formal autonomy earlier this year. `` The Hazara want to be part of the government, but not their -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- government,'' said one 52-year-old professional interviewed at the <LOCATION> Chendawul </LOCATION> mosque. `` It is a communist government.'' The group was officially discriminated against for years, kept out of the army and their rituals banned in public. The Hazara now have religious freedom, but they contend the government ignores their development needs. `` If you go to <LOCATION> Hazarajat </LOCATION>, there are no houses, there are no schools, there are no hospitals,'' said a mullah, or prayer leader, at the <LOCATION> Chendawul </LOCATION> mosque. The Hazara spoke in interviews only on condition of anonymity, saying that many who publicly denounced the government in the past were sent to prison. They said the government's wooing them is in part motivated by the desire to improve relations with neighboring <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, founded by the late <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, is run by <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> clergymen and supports the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> branches of the Moslem rebels, the mujahedeen, seeking to overthrow the government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The Hazara say they respect <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> as a religious figure but do not look to his revolution to solve their problems. Many Hazara reject fellow Shiites who have joined the government, such as Prime Minister Sultan <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Kishtmand </PERSON>. `` The people in the party, it makes no difference from what place, what religion they are, we still think they are communist,'' said the mullah. <PERSON> Najmuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawyani </PERSON>, secretary of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committeee </ORGANIZATION>, says, `` Our party is not a communist party, our ideology is not a communist one.'' Government officials say development will come in time. They point out that President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, who uses just one name, went to the <LOCATION> Chendawul </LOCATION> mosque in August and pledged 10 million afghans, about $ 180,000, for reconstruction. Suspicions about the religious faith of the government also are held by other Afghan Moslems, including <PERSON> Maulavi </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> at the upscale <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> mosque, which is surrounded by a rose garden in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s diplomatic quarter. `` Our people are Moslem,'' he said. `` We do n't know about the government.'' The Sunni <PERSON> Maulavi </PERSON>, who is roughly the equivalent of a bishop, spent five months in prison after he assailed Soviet influence in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> at a sermon the president had attended. He also opposes the government's practice of writing sermons in support of its policies for the 20,000 mullahs on its payroll. `` Religion should be free,'' <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> said. The role of the government is `` to build more mosques, persuade people to pray more, to establish the conditions so people will want to pray,'' he said. The lack of trust in the party stems from alleged atrocities that followed the April 1978 Marxist revolution. Independent studies put the number of Afghans killed in those early days of the revolution at 50,000 to 100,000, with <PERSON> Hazara </PERSON> and clergymen a particular target. Hazara claim 13,000 of their tribesman disappeared from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in one day. The government's land redistribution program was seen as an attempt to rewrite Moslem inheritance laws and a heavy-handed literacy campaign as an attack on the clergy as teachers. Even the study of Islamic art was banned. These measures helped spark the rebellion against the government and all have been reversed since the Soviet intervention in December 1979, after which a more tolerant wing of the party was given power. `` The culture of the people must be taken into considertion,'' said <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghafoor </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahir </PERSON>, minister of Islamic guidance. `` When the revolution came there were some mistakes.'' Islam was enshrined as the state religion in the constitution adopted in 1987, which also stipulates that the president be a Moslem. New laws can not contradict Islamic law. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has won praise for establishing the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The Soviet withdrawel in February gave a major boost to combating his un-Islamic image. The research center publishes books about Islamic history in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, such as a chronicle of the holy place in <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>. It is also a religious cheering section for the party, however. Its walls are plastered with stickers of Koranic quotations used by President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. `` He who destroys the house of one Moslem, he is in truth destroying his own house,'' said one quotation. It is a pointed reference to the destruction wrought by rockets of the mujahedeen, whose name means holy warriors. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddiq </PERSON> <PERSON> Sailani </PERSON>, the university's president, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said that its aim is to educate students and that the religious squabbling impedes progress. `` Some traditional customs that exist among the people are un-Islamic,'' he said. `` We want to replace them with the real Islam.'' Among the customs he listed as un-Islamic was what he described as the lack of equal treatment for women. `` A woman is not a toy,'' he said. `` Islam establishes many rights for women and the rights should never be threatened by men.'' The government viewpoint on this and other issues clashes sharply with that of <PERSON> Gulbuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, leader of the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION> faction of the Pakistani-based mujahedeen. He has a reputation for having all the bars in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> bombed because <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> forbids the consumption of alcohol. His group also is believed responsible for killing two women bus drivers by blowing up their buses when the government briefly experimented with women drivers several years ago. The government also highlights what it calls the atrocities committed in the name of Islam by the Saudi Arabian-financed Wahhabi mercenaries fighting for the mujahedeen. Reports of their mutilating victims and selling women into slavery are widespread. `` In our opinion, it is because of lack of knowledge of the Koran that makes people act like this,'' said <PERSON> Gholam </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Manzur </PERSON>, president of the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clergy </ORGANIZATION>. Afghans in general say they basically want Islam respected by the government.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Look Who's Talking''</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Film opens nationwide Oct. 13.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Remember the `` Bachelor Mother'' kind of movie in which <PERSON> Ginger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> seeks a husband so her baby will have a father? `` Look Who's Talking'' is a 1989 replay with all the old gimmicks intact -LRB- `` I do n't like to fly,'' she insists. Next scene, she's flying in his plane -RRB-. The only innovation: the baby talks. Not only that, the voice is that of <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>. The title, get it? It's a pleasant sitcom with amiable performances, especially by the four infants who play <PERSON> Mikey </PERSON>. The scenes under the titles will no doubt arouse controversy. A large round object floats amid translucent, undulating folds of matter, bouncing gently at the bottom of a pit. A flock of flittering, chattering polliwogs enters the space, and one of them joyfully discovers the round object and climbs inside. A new kind of sex education. Throughout the film, the voice of <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> makes comments, enjoying his nine-month swim, complaining about his abrupt emergence, conversing with other infants and generally observing the human comedy. The one-liners wear thin, but some of it is funny stuff. <PERSON> Mikey </PERSON>'s mother is <LOCATION> Kirstie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alley </LOCATION>, a thirtysomething accountant who has been impregnated by her client, a lecherous, charmless fast-food entrepreneur -LRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON> -RRB-. When she goes into labor, she hails a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> cab driven by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Travolta </PERSON>, who races her to the hospital, then dons a mask and gown and witnesses the delivery. As you can guess, he falls for <PERSON> Kirstie </PERSON> and her baby, but she considers him a loser. He becomes the sitter while she prowls for prospective fathers, not realizing that <PERSON> Travolta </PERSON> is really a struggling flight instructor. To illustrate his compassion, there is a subplot about his concern for his senile grandfather -LRB- <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Vigoda </PERSON> -RRB-. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckerling </PERSON> -LRB- `` Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' -RRB- directed her own script, a loose affair that allows the actors to ad lib aimlessly. The veracity of the film was not helped by filming it in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The producers saved money, but there's no way that <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> can double for <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kirstie </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> manages an endearing portrait of the beleaguered mother; she's as appealing on the big screen as she is in `` Cheers.'' <PERSON> Travolta </PERSON> is so laid back that he seems invisible at times, but it's good to see him back. <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has some bright moments as the worrying grandmother. `` Look Who's Talking'' is a Tri-Star release produced by <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krane </PERSON>. The rating is PG-13, mostly for adult situations. Running time: 103 minutes.

 `` Edge of Sanity'' -LRB- Virgin Vision. VHS-Beta, $ 89.95. Rated R -RRB- In `` Edge of Sanity'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> remakes the classic Dr. <PERSON> Jekyll </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> role into cheap buffoonery. As the good doctor <PERSON> Jekyll </PERSON>, he discovers the anesthetic powers of a remarkable new drug, cocaine. His research elevates him in the eyes of his peers. It advances the causes of medicine. It gives him vigor and vitality. It's great. But it also leads to his downfall. In a laboratory mishap, <PERSON> Jekyll </PERSON> is exposed to spooky dry-ice-like fumes, apparently from the cocaine, that _ presto _ change him into a ghoulish monster. As <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, he is unable to resist his most base desire, which, as it turns out, is slashing the throats of prostitutes on the streets of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Also as <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, he gets a ridiculous makeup job. His face is slathered with a white film that looks suspiciously like Crisco. His eyes are lined with auburn rings and his lips are painted with cracking ruby-red grease. The pursuit of the murderer, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> the Ripper-Hyde, has <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard in a dither. Even though <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> kills many of his victims in plain view, has several witnesses and leaves behind mounds of indicting evidence, the poor blokes ca n't seem to nab the killer. If you can get beyond those leaps of logic, you might find some humor and entertainment value in the movie. If you take it seriously and consider it a legitimate suspense thriller, you will certainly be on ... the edge of sanity. _ By <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bibby </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Working Girl'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>. VHS-Beta, $ 89.98. Rated R -RRB- With the possible exception of the gorgeous panoramic opening view of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from the Statue of Liberty, `` Working Girl'' is as charming and fun to watch at home as it was in the theater. And the charm is the problem. In the guise of a tale of one of the little people making it big on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, `` Working Girl'' reinforces stereotypes: Most of the secretaries are good-hearted but not real bright and not too classy. The one woman at the top, <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Sigourney </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> -RRB-, is perfectly tailored but a manipulative liar who tramples other women and men to keep her place. <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> <PERSON> McGill </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> -RRB-, the secretary who breaks out of the typing pool, lies and cheats her way out, using as an excuse that she had no part in making the rules she's breaking. And she's also escaping her working-class boyfriend and crowd stuck out on dumpy <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Assisting <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> in her meteoric rise is _ of course _ a modern Prince Charming, a broker played by <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. From the start this is not just a business partnership, and even <PERSON> Tess </PERSON>' friend -LRB- played wonderfully by <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON> -RRB- can see the obvious and warns <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> not to expect him to take her `` away from all this,'' though the audience certainly expects that to happen. And the movie can be sloppy: If <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> is so determined to make it on Wall Street that she takes class after class and can show up the male traders, then how could she possibly have overlooked the `` dress for success'' advice? The acting is superior _ <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> all are a treat to watch. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>'s screenplay is witty and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>' direction is lively _ almost covering up the lack of freshness underneath _ By <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> MacVean </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bruford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wakeman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Arista </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- At least when <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakeman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> were members of Yes, it took comparatively few strokes of the computer keyboard to dismiss them. Now that they bill themselves as <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bruford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wakeman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> it's a bit more time-consuming. So let's be brief. Their record is as ponderous as the group's name, all the worst tendencies of 1970s art rock brought back to life in digital sound <PERSON> Wakeman </PERSON>'s pompous synthesizer playing and <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s soprano are even more annoying than they were 15 years ago. Such titles as `` Fist of Fire'' and `` Rock Gives Courage'' tell you not much is happening lyrically, either. Even worse, these men choose to noodle and drone for 60 minutes, making this record a real endurance test. Do n't encourage them. Just say no. _ By <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 Piano Quintet in A, the `` Trout,'' by <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON>; Piano Quartet in G minor, by <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Amadeus </PERSON> <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>; <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnabel </PERSON> and the Pro Arte Quartet -LRB- EMI -RRB-. <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnabel </PERSON>, giant of 20th century pianists and superlative <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> interpreter, is reported to have said: `` I play <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON> to make my living; Schubert I play for love.'' His loving treatment of the `` Trout'' can be heard on this <ORGANIZATION> EMI </ORGANIZATION> reissue of a 1935 recording, previously released on Arabesque. The interpretation may put off some listeners at first, but it grows on you after a number of hearings. <PERSON> Schnabel </PERSON>'s occasional rhythmic flexing evokes an earlier romantic style, as do the string players' tendency to slide between notes. The sound quality is not the greatest. The remastering from 78s is uneven, and background noise considerable. But first violinst <PERSON> Alphonse </PERSON> <PERSON> Ounnou </PERSON>'s sweet tone and <PERSON> Schnabel </PERSON>'s direct, lucid reading of the notes shine through. The performance is brisk and muscular, but not so much that <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON>'s fleeting changes of color and mood are sacrificed. In the first movement, phrases seem to build through their own natural momentum. The cello and viola of the Pro Arte, a Belgian quartet founded in 1912 and one of the most prominent before World War II, sing beautifully in the Andante. The scherzo is the least successful of the movements, with a not very appealing percussive, militaristic quality. The tempi in the fourth movement variations never seem quite right, but that problem is straightened out in the forceful finale. The wonderful Mozart G minor quartet was recorded a year earlier. <PERSON> Schnabel </PERSON> and the Pro Arte members give a clean, square-cut rendition. More than in the <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON>, the pianist's singing tone and uncluttered phrasing come out. _ By <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 Piano Concerto in G minor, by <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Introduction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Allegro Appassionato, by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumann </PERSON>; <PERSON> Andras </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Vienna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION>, conducted by <PERSON> Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Dohnanyi </PERSON> -LRB- <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> -RRB-. The G minor piano concerto was written in 1876, midway through <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON>'s happy career. Behind the Bohemian master were five symphonies, a good deal of chamber music and his first opera. He had yet to write his last symphonic masterpieces, including `` From the New Work,'' the opera `` Rusalka'' and his best concerto, the B minor for cello. The 35-year-old composer was still 16 years away from coming to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservatory </ORGANIZATION>, where he was affectionately known as Old Borax. The G minor is a middling sort of work, a little long in the first movement, sometimes amorphous and lacking truly memorable moments. Yet the sunny melodies, Slavonic motifs and beautiful orchestration are there. The orchestra is no mere accompaniment but collaborates with the soloist in a joint symphonic effort. <PERSON> Dohnanyi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> play it that way. Pianist and orchestra players beautifully link their passages, picking up and gently handing back themes. The <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> strings show an amazing sweetness in the highest reaches. The performance is live and shows few of the drawbacks of that medium, with the usual advantages of freshness, immediacy and excitement. <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> and the orchestra are close to flawless technically, and the audience is incredibly quiet. No tubercular ward of coughers here. But the piano's recorded sound lacks richness and sounds almost thin in the upper register. In the <PERSON> Schumann </PERSON>, not recorded live, <PERSON> Dohnanyi </PERSON> draws particularly tasteful and melding phrases from the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> plays well, though the inspiration level seems to dip. Maybe that is due to a comparison with the live <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON> performance. _ By <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriquez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> y <PERSON> Velazquez </PERSON> managed to fill his canvases with spirit and dignity, whether his subject was a nobleman or a twisted dwarf. His exquisite use of color and the fluidity of his paint made him one of the most celebrated and honored artists of the 17th century Spanish School. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is showing the stylistic intellect of <PERSON> Velazquez </PERSON> at an exhibit through Jan. 7. The show includes his `` An Old Woman Cooking Eggs'' -LRB- 1618 -RRB- with its haunting reality and `` The Forge of Vulcan'' and `` <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>'s Coat,'' two large works painted during a trip to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in 1629-31. Born in <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Velazquez </PERSON> was apprenticed to <PERSON> Franciso </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> at age 11, and later to <PERSON> Franciso </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacheco </PERSON>. `` Christ and the Pilgrims of <LOCATION> Emmaus </LOCATION>'' is among his early work and shows his developing tendencies toward naturalism. He was made court painter at the age of 25. In his later years, when he painted `` Coronation of the Virgin'' and `` The Maids of Honor,'' <PERSON> Velazquez </PERSON> had mastered the subtleties of color. The exhibit of 38 compositions is the largest ever of <PERSON> Velazquez </PERSON>'s work. About half are on loan from the Prado in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 For a political activist such as <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, the experience of playing the role of an Afrikaner who becomes a fighter against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid was something to `` kick-start'' his soul. The film is `` A Dry White Season,'' which so moved another actor, <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brando </PERSON>, that he ended a nine-year retirement to take the brief role of a civil rights lawyer. The MGM release is also notable as the first major film by <ORGANIZATION> Euzhan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palcy </ORGANIZATION>, a 32-year-old from <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION> who directed her only other feature, `` Sugar Cane Alley,'' on a $ 1 million budget. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> and Palcy were here to help kick off `` A Dry White Season,'' and in separate interviews both had high praise for <PERSON> Brando </PERSON>. `` He's a genius,'' declared <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>. `` A genius as a performer but also as a human being. He has this immense wealth of observation, culture and literary reserves. You start to talk to him, and you can see the ripples of the little stone you throw into the water. `` As a fellow actor, he is blissful and so sharing. He makes you feel so secure. I'm 54, and to work with this man that I used to see in movie theaters and giggle at because he was so perfect, it was incredibly intimidating. I had this crush on him; I just wanted to be next to him.'' `` He was wonderful,'' said <PERSON> Palcy </PERSON>, a stunning beauty with a dark helmet of tiny braids. `` When <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> came to the set the first day of shooting _ dead silence. Nobody was talking. It was magical, the myth was there. At the end of the first shot, he did something very funny: He said, ` And now I'm going to pee.' Everybody laughed, realizing he was a human being.'' Expectedly, <PERSON> Brando </PERSON> brought his own concepts to the role of the defense lawyer: rumpled hair, a limp, a cane and an English accent _ `` <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> did n't want to portray an Afrikaner, so he wanted the character to be an English South African barrister,'' the director said. Palcy's involvement with `` A Dry White Season'' began in 1984, when she read the <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Brink </PERSON> novel about an Afrikaner school teacher whose tolerance for apartheid turns to activism at the sight of the regime's atrocities. Two years later she joined forces with <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> producer <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, who had been seeking a project about <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The pair developed the script at <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, which decided not to proceed. MGM's then boss, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, agreed to sponsor the project. A key element in getting `` A Dry White Season'' made was the participation of <PERSON> Brando </PERSON>. The connection was made through the actor's close friend, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanter </PERSON>, then <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON>'s associate. When <PERSON> Brando </PERSON> approved the script, <ORGANIZATION> Palcy </ORGANIZATION> warned that the $ 9 million budget did not permit big salaries. He replied, `` I'll do it for nothing.'' <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> became involved in `` A Dry White Season'' through his former agent, <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paula </PERSON>'s mother. <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> also served as his agent before moving on to production posts at major studios. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> signed on at one-third his usual salary. `` I thought it had the potential to be an entertaining film in the best sense of entertainment,'' said the actor, who has never visited <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` I did n't want it to be just a message picture. `` I loved the idea of this film being about an Afrikaner, not about a white Anglo liberal, but an Afrikaner whose forebears had forged their way through on that great trek to set up their own community. It was not unlike what we did in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: We came in and wiped out the local people, put them into reserves.'' The locations for `` A Dry White Season'' were filmed in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> rhapsodized about such experiences as watching 79 elephants walking noiselessly in the moonlight. `` Of all of the places I've been, including <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> is the only place where my wife and I want to go back on vacation,'' he said. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> has traveled far from <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>, where he grew up plagued by shyness, ill health and gawkiness that prompted playmates to call him <PERSON> Dumbo </PERSON> and Goofus. He withdrew into a world of imagination, fashioning puppets and performing his own plays. He claims a 40-year career. `` At 14 I was a radio announcer in <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Then I went to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> and got involved in theater there. I studied at the Academy of Music and Dramatic Art in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. I worked in the professional theater in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> until I got a walk-on part in a film called ` The Dirty Dozen.''' He recalled sitting around a table with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON> and other members of the cast. <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> complained to director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrich </PERSON> that he did n't want to impersonate a general because it was n't fitting for his role as an Indian. `` So <PERSON> Aldrich </PERSON>, who made decisions faster than you can imagine, looked down the table, saw my shaved head but did n't know my name. He said, ` You with the big ears, you do it.' That changed everything,'' <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> recalled. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> became one of the screen's busiest actors, with such achievements as `` M-A-S-H,'' `` Klute'' and `` Ordinary People,'' as well as duds such as `` Start the Revolution Without Me,'' `` Casanova'' and `` Die! Die! My Darling!'' Now his son, <PERSON> Kiefer </PERSON>, is following his father's footsteps. `` He's terrific,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>. `` He has what I used to have before I went to school and had it trained out of me: a kind of purity.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Symphony Star Started Career Late, at Age Nine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Finnish conducter <ORGANIZATION> Esa-Pekka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salonen </ORGANIZATION> is a star in the symphony orchestra world, and his only lament is that his career in classical music started late _ at age 9. `` In this business people start at age 4 or 5,'' said the 31-year-old <PERSON> Salonen </PERSON>, named in August as musical director of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION>. `` I realized young that this would have to be my life. I had no other hobbies.'' <PERSON> Salonen </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> recently as a guest conducter, said he looks forward to settling down with the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> orchestra after years of nomadic conducting. He begins with the 1992-93 season. He succeeds <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Previn </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. ` When I got the offer from <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>, I did a hell of a lot of thinking ... finally, after some time, I decided it made a lot of sense,'' <PERSON> Salonen </PERSON> said. `` With the L.A. Philharmonic I have an instrument that is capable of anything. I have no other plans beyond it. It is definitely one of the world's most important symphonies and the possibilities are unlimited.'' Between bites of an apple during an interview in a hotel lobby, the boyishly handsome <PERSON> Salonen </PERSON> said, `` Frankly I'm fed up with hotels and guest conducting.'' He currently conducts the <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> and is principal guest conducter of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> Philharmonic. These and other engagements keep him on the road up to 44 weeks a year. He speaks five languages, but countries often blur and, `` in the morning it does n't matter what I say, its always in the wrong language.'' <PERSON> Salonen </PERSON>, in jeans and a blazer, said his weariness goes deeper than jet lag. `` Guest conducting is almost doomed to be superficial unless you know the orchestra very well. You work with one orchestra and then a week later you go to another place,'' he said. `` What really excites me ... is getting beneath the skin of an orchestra, which is not possible as a guest conducter. It takes a long time to build up trust. You have to establish certain musical habits in an orchestra to be able to express yourself.'' So he will take a `` semi-sabbatical'' in 1991. `` I will lay down in my hammock and remain there until I feel the urge to do something.'' But he will remain open about guest conducting in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> and elsewhere and about renewing his Swedish contract, which overlaps with his <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> contract for the 1992-93 season. <PERSON> Salonen </PERSON> drew international attention in 1983 when he conducted, with one week's notice, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonia </LOCATION> performance of <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>'s Third Symphony. It was followed by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debut with the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION> and concerts in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philidelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I always have so much work to do that I have n't really had time to think about such concepts as success,'' he said. <PERSON> Salonen </PERSON> was raised in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>. His classical music training began at age 9. He studied composition and conducted at <ORGANIZATION> Sibelius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. He eventually began to give concerts in <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>. `` I happened to be part of a stimulating group and we had a music society,'' he said of his childhood experience. `` I loved the instant feedback. It was fun.'' He still joins young Finns who compose and play their own music in a group called Avanti! A a composer, french horn player and pianist, <PERSON> Salonen </PERSON> began conducting to make a living, and `` because I needed a conducter who was sympathetic to my music, and that was me. `` Now I would rather see someone else conduct my music ... I get very nervous about conducting my own music.'' He is known as a champion of contempory music and avant-garde experimentation. A philharmonic has a dual function, he said: as a guardian of traditional music and as a forum for new ideas. `` Contemperary music allows you to understand old musical phenomena in new ways,'' he said. A conductor's frustration is having to depend on others, he said. `` You never make your own sound. You depend on the orchestra. The chemistry ... is essential. `` It's hard to describe what I will do in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. It must be something organic, something that emerges by itself from the collaboration between the orchestra and me.'' <PERSON> Salonen </PERSON> got to know the orchestra as a regular guest since 1984. His youth and small-country origins will be no problem, he said. In <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, talent finds encouragement. `` I never felt the age question as a problem in the States. The society favors youth ... and age does n't help if you ca n't deliver,'' he said Being a hot property presents other problems. `` You know three or four years in advance exactly where you will be on any given date. It creates a claustrophobic feeling, like your life is being taken away from you. You talk and think about things that are five years in the future, but by that time you will be five years older,'' he said. <PERSON> Salonen </PERSON> still has few hobbies. An avid reader and movie buff, he occasionally listens to pop music so he can know what's going on, and he can not relax with classical music. `` If I listen to classical music when I'm relaxing I immediately go to work, thinking about how I would do it,'' he said. `` I relax to enthic music, Indian and Japanese, because I can just listen.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Not the Average Rock Band</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Combine a mail deliverer, a dishwasher, a tour guide and a certified driller of bowling balls and you have `` Katrina and the Waves,'' not the average rock' n' roll band. Take the name, for instance. Former postal worker <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Rew </PERSON> is the acknowledged leader, the band's principal writer and arranger. So who gets top billing? Singer and ex-dishwasher <PERSON> Katrina </PERSON> <PERSON> Leskanich </PERSON>, of course. `` At first <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> was doing the singing and the group was called ` The Waves,''' explained drummer <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, the band's one-time tour guide `` But once <PERSON> Katrina </PERSON> started singing, we became ` Katrina and the Waves.' Someone said we'd get more dates at the military camps because the soldiers will come out for a girl's name. Military camps are important because both <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leskanich </PERSON> grew up in military families that traveled all over the world. <PERSON> Leskanich </PERSON> alone has lived in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. The group's first live performances were at military bases, before crowds that responded to a singer called Katrina. `` We used to play on these horrible naval bases up in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> where these guys had in been submarines for six months and I was the first female they'd seen,'' <PERSON> Leskanich </PERSON> said. `` They'd go absolutely wild, they were up to here in liquor. They'd pull down their pants right on the dance floor. We just collapsed laughing, it was all a joke. We're trying to do our number and it was just ridiculous.'' In 1981, <PERSON> Rew </PERSON> wrote `` Walking on Sunshine,'' a good old-fashioned rock' n' roll summer song _ bouncy melody, memorable guitar riffs and <PERSON> Katrina </PERSON>'s joyous vocals on top. It sounded like a sure hit, and was: four years later. `` We took it around to all the stations and all the companies, and nothing happened,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. `` Then we were signed at the end of'84 to Capitol and at the end of'85 they put it out, pow! A classic! It was released at the right time, just one of those things.'' After finally cracking the charts, Katrina and the Waves could be expected to get right to work on a new album. They did, but the record did n't come out until recently. `` We thought we had finished the record,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. `` But we took it back home and listened to it, and said: ` Oh dear. I think we'll start again.' We did that twice.'' The Waves consider their group a democracy; whoever shouts loudest wins. Nothing is considered finished until everyone is satisfied, and with four very distinct personalities, that can take time. `` <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> is dad. I'd sit home all the time if I could. ` C'mon,' he'll say, ` let's get on the bus,''' said bassist and bowling ball surgeon <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> is the mad professor. Katrina is chief brat. I just try to do as little as possible.'' The band agrees that <PERSON> Katrina </PERSON>'s voice and <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>'s guitar and songwriting are the key to their sound. But since Katrina wo n't sing anything that does n't feel right, `` creative differences'' can emerge `` <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s songs are brilliant and he's still going to write songs on his own that the band's not going to touch,'' <PERSON> Katrina </PERSON> said. `` But he's trying to write songs from my point of view and sometimes I did n't agree.'' She cited `` Crush on You,'' a ballad off the new album. `` At first, I thought it was a little too boy-meets-girl. That's a good example of one of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s ` boy-meets-girl' songs I tried to change but when I did, it lost the innocence `` I have to sing a song from my point of view. I feel it's going to be believed. But when you are trying to write from someone else's point of view, you start getting into cliches.'' While all due admiration for <PERSON> Rew </PERSON>, the fellow Waves have started contributing their own material. Katrina and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> co-wrote `` To Have and to Hold'' and `` Love Calculator.'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> share credits on `` Rock Myself to Sleep,'' and the whole band contributed to `` Chain Lover,'' `` Rock' n' Roll Girls'' and the hit single `` Break of Hearts.'' `` We've only started doing that in the last six months,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> tended to always just come to us with songs, but he suggested himself after about eight years that we should contribute. It's taken us eight years to get confident enough to work on our own ideas.'' Sharing material has helped keep the band together; so has separating their private lives. `` You live a very tense existence,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said, `` but we all have interests outside the band that are not musical and not similar to each other's interests. `` <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>'s happy to be working 24 hours a day, seven days a week on music. It's a complete obsession. We love music, too, but not with that kind of intensity.''

 Money matters to <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>. But the author does n't yearn for luxury hotels or billion-dollar deals, just simple things _ a nice apartment or a good movie. The characters in her second novel, `` Disappearing Acts'' -LRB- Viking, $ 18.95 -RRB-, think a lot about money, too. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> works off and on as a construction worker. Zora is a school teacher dreaming of making it as a singer and songwriter. They're two warm, intelligent people living in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> who meet by accident and fall in love. But if savings are low, luck matters, and <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> and Zora are nearly destroyed by events they're incapable of controlling `` She loves <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said. `` That's the whole point of the story. How much is enough? How much do you give before you say, ` I ca n't do this anymore'? `` It's like real life. Every relationship starts out great and then reality sets in and there are things you have to deal with. A lot of it boils down to how much of an investment you're willing to make in order to make a marriage, or whatever, work.'' The novel is a tapestry of exits and entrances, disappearances and reappearances. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>'s moods fluctuate like the Dow Jones average, ranging from playfulness to self-pity and violence. Zora, hiding a case of epilepsy she fears will drive her man away, juggles career and family, finding release in music, friends and the son conceived with <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>. `` The title of the book came to me in a dream,'' <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said. `` I was in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and I knew I wanted to tell the story about what can happen between a man and a woman when they fall in love and all these other things happen. `` I was in a similar situation where I could n't believe I had arrived at this point. I stopped seeing my friends, I stopped going to certain places because he was n't interested. I just disappeared. I went to sleep and when I woke up that morning, I said, ` Disappearing Acts.''' <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> lets <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> and Zora tell their own stories, trading chapters between the two. She began with the names, originally wanting to call <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Langston </PERSON>,'' after author and poet <PERSON> Langston </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, and Zora `` <PERSON> Mona </PERSON>.'' But somehow, `` <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>,'' with its soft first syllable running into the hard `` k'' and gently trailing off again, fit the powerful, sensitive man tortured by his inability to find steady work. And the sophisticated but streetwise woman he alternately loves and torments was renamed `` Zora'' in honor of the great writer <PERSON> Zora </PERSON> <PERSON> Neale </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurston </PERSON>. The voices followed _ <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>'s earthy and angry, tender and romantic. A self-educated black man trying to win Zora's trust while battling a racist society and his own feelings of inadequacy. His voice is mirrored in the following passage: `` I could see that she was a little scared at first. I mean, sparks was flying so fast and everything, and I was just waiting for her to tell me that her heart had been broke so many times she did n't trust men no more. I was all set to tell her, ` This time, baby, do n't be scared. This man ai n't interested in breaking your heart _ he's interested in gluing it back together and keeping it for hisself.''' Zora's voice is hopeful and frightened. She's smart enough to know what she wants but too dependent on <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> to contend with his bitterness and physical power: `` One of the things I've loved about <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> from the start is how safe he makes me feel. Protected. I'm not even talking about his job situation. I'm talking about his heart. When he puts his arms around me, if the wind was blowing a hundred miles an hour, I would n't know it. ... One thing I'm sure of _ when <PERSON> God </PERSON> made him, he should've been cloned. More women need to feel like this.'' Zora was harder for <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> to write than <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>. `` I wanted her to have some street smarts, but I did n't want her to be one of these prissy <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> types,'' the author said. `` There are a lot of educated black people who sound white. I did n't want her to sound like that. There's a rhythm to her sentences.'' Much of <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>'s childhood can be traced by reading her first novel, `` Mama.'' She grew up in a poor section of Point Haven, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, but escaped to the sunshine and promise of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as a teen-ager in the late 1960s. A love affair at 18 inspired her to write poetry, and soon <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> was writing vignettes. She attended the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, joining a fiction workshop run by novelist and poet <PERSON> Ishmael </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, who encouraged <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> to tap her writing talents. `` It was so easy, so gratifying,'' said <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, who now lives in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> `` Not to say I actually wrote and finished real stories, but the whole thing was emerging and it was just wonderful.'' Vignettes soon gave way to short stories and one short story gave way to `` Mama,'' published in 1985. <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> needed just two weeks to write the book's first draft and another two weeks to complete the second. `` My mother raised a houseful of kids, sort of alone, and I think she did a good job of it,'' she said. `` I could n't figure out how she did it. It was more of an exploration, or a recounting, of where she got her strength from. `` ` Mama' was autobiographical and so is ` Disappearing Acts.' When I say autobiographical, I mean being able to relate and identify with things that I have witnessed, seen, observed or experienced or a combination of all of them.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Urban Cowboy Johnny Lee Lost It All</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was an unknown honky-tonk performer before his song `` Lookin' for Love'' from the movie `` Urban Cowboy'' climbed the charts. His stardom, though, was merely a blink in time. His career, finances and personal life all plunged, and now he's trying to regain some of what he lost. He has a 10-album contract with Curb Records. He's selling another LP, `` <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Water,'' through TV marketing. His biography, `` Lookin' for Love,'' has just been published by <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION>. `` The negative stuff is in the past,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` Things are positive now. I look forward to making good records, having a family, being happy and healthy and being alive.'' When `` Urban Cowboy,'' with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Travolta </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Debra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winger </ORGANIZATION>, came out in 1980, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s `` Lookin' for Love'' became a hit on both the country music and pop charts. Another song, `` Cherokee Fiddle,'' was also on the movie's soundtrack LP, which sold 3 million copies. He and his country buddy, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON>, came to represent country chic in their snappy cowboy hats, spiffy Western shirts and expensive cowboy boots. They appeared on TV shows such as `` Fantasy Island,'' `` CHIPs,'' `` The Dukes of Hazzard'' and `` The Fall Guy.'' And <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> married actress <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilton </PERSON>, who portrayed <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON> on TV's `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.'' Today, he and <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> are hardly friends. He went four years without making a record. All the money he thought he made during his peak years has vanished. He and <PERSON> Tilton </PERSON> divorced. They had a child, <PERSON> Cherish </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, 7. `` I lost everything except my talent,'' the 43-year-old singer said. `` I never saw a dime.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> has since remarried, to <PERSON> Deb </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> in November 1986. That marriage was a year after he released `` Keep Me Hanging On,'' his last album until this fall's `` New Directions.'' For reasons still unclear to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, no record company wanted him. `` I felt absolutely useless,'' he said. `` My dignity was taken away. I just worked jobs at clubs here and there _ did whatever I could do. It was quite devastating for a while.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was a nightclub singer in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> area when he was chosen to sing `` Lookin' for Love'' in the `` Urban Cowboy'' movie. `` Everybody related to it,'' he said. `` It's a meaningful, simple song. To this day, everyone still knows the words to that song.'' He followed it with hit records such as `` One in a Million,'' `` Pickin' Up Strangers,'' `` You Could've Heard a Heart Break'' and `` Yellow Rose,'' which also was the theme song for the former TV series. But he had trouble getting money he felt was due him from his career. An associate who was handling money <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> earned from performing told him the money had been deposited in safe accounts, but when <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> tried to get his money back he was unable to do so. He hired lawyers to try to get the money, but legal fees mounted and he finally could afford them no longer. He gave up. `` I was ready to get on with my life and start over. That's what I had to do, start over,'' he said. He and <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> went their separate ways under strained circumstances, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said, because <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> apparently felt <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> did n't support him in his own legal battles `` I still think the world of <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` I love him like a brother. But I've called him numerous times and he's never returned my calls. I'm a little let down with him. It hurts me to think so much of someone ... you can only do that for so long. If they do n't think the same about you, what are you going to do? `` I still think he's a great talent and a great guy and I miss the relationship we had.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> estimates that he owns at least 100 cowboy hats. `` I just always have worn them,'' he said. `` All the clothes I have go with them.''

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> began to ponder his own mortality after his father died 20 years ago, and wondered how to extend his own life. Two years later, <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> found a way to help find an answer. He enlisted as one of 1,000 volunteers in what has become the longest-running comprehensive study of growing old, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging. `` We owe it to ourselves,'' said <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON>, 57 _ a year older than his father was when he died. `` I'm a great believer in what it is trying to do.'' <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> comes every two years from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Gerontology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Key </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for 2 -LCB- days of tests. `` A great deal of energy has been spent by scientists who have worked in this study for over a quarter of a century to prove that aging is not a disease and does not necessarily end in a disease process,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fozard </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> BLSA </ORGANIZATION>'s scientific director since 1985. `` Many of the things that we used to blame on age ... are indeed modifiable -LRB- by lifestyle -RRB- and probably add to the life expectancy and add to the quality of life of people.'' The BLSA, a component of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on Aging in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, was founded in 1958 by Dr. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shock </PERSON>, regarded as the founder of modern research on aging. He started the first NIH section on gerontology in 1941 at <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. `` Dr. Shock wanted to measure such things as the rate of aging,'' said <PERSON> Fozard </PERSON>. `` As it turns out, this hope sort of disintegrated and was replaced by a number of more specific questions.'' BLSA researchers have studied aging's effects on more than 1,800 people, who are given physical examinations. Tests are done each visit on all of the organ systems, the condition of the blood, muscles, bones, hearing and vision. Electrocardiograms and tests using radiation are given less frequently. Volunteers also are tested on their memory, reasoning and problem-solving abilities, intelligence and personality, a history of each person's aging that is used in more than 50 studies under way as part of the overall project. Among the findings is that `` there is no single biological master clock which drives all of the physiological aging that we see,'' <PERSON> Fozard </PERSON> said. Volunteers pay their own way to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and spend more than two days every 2 -LCB- years undergoing as many as 103 medical and behavioral tests. `` I know of no other study that makes that kind of demand,'' he said. `` We ask them for a lifetime'' of commitment, and many agree to be autopsied after they die. The study pays for lodging and meals while volunteers are here, as well as for the tests, which could total $ 4,000 at a doctor's office or hospital The volunteers range in age from 20 to 97. Sixty-five percent are men, 70 percent are college educated, and half of those have advanced degrees. Most are middle - or upper-middle-class and only 5 percent are black `` In some of the studies the social class definitely makes a difference,'' <PERSON> Fozard </PERSON> said. `` In that sense, the study may not be as representative'' as one with a more varied sample. But `` when you compare all types of biological results, these things do n't vary much on social class.'' Scientists who use data from the <ORGANIZATION> BLSA </ORGANIZATION> say the racial and social structure of the study is one of its weaknesses. `` In an ideal world, we'd have it truly representative of all groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Wilmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` But you have to be realistic. There is a variety of people there and everybody is going to die. Everybody gets old.'' Researchers say the study's history explains its sociological profile. The first subject, Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, recruited participants from among family and friends, a practice that continues among volunteers today. The study has a waiting list of about 1,000 people, and researchers have not made an effort to broaden its base, <PERSON> Fozard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>'s grandfather volunteered shortly after the study began. Since then, <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Glenwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, his father, brother and three sisters became involved. His wife, <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON>, and a sister's husband also have volunteered The involvement of nine members of a single family could help the <ORGANIZATION> BLSA </ORGANIZATION> determine whether heredity determines aging, <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> said. `` If they can see a trend in different generations of a family, they might find a genetic link.'' That genetic link still has scientists baffled, <PERSON> Fozard </PERSON> said. `` We are constantly looking for ways to measure to get a handle on the genetic component of aging. We think there are only a few genes involved with aging, but where they are and what they are is still a mystery.'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, 86, of <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, joined the study in 1960. He recently completed his 13th checkup for the study, which he said has `` made me more cognizant of aging and the aging population.'' <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> said he also has modified his diet and made other changes in his lifestyle as a result of information gleaned during his visit. Information on any medical problem detected is given to the volunteers, and their family physicians are notified so treatment can be prescribed. `` The longer I have cooperated, the more they are providing information to us,'' <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> said. `` They give me good advice and that is very helpful.'' Fifteen scientists work with the <ORGANIZATION> BLSA </ORGANIZATION> full-time, <PERSON> Fozard </PERSON> said. As many as 10 other scientists collaborate periodically through agreements with universities around the country. The study has an annual budget of about $ 3 million. Volunteers say the <ORGANIZATION> BLSA </ORGANIZATION>'s impact on society is enormous. `` The longer it can run, the more value they will get out of it,'' said <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>. `` I would certainly hate to see it stopped.''

<HEAD>New Rules Ease Threat of Poverty When Spouse Enters Nursing Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Husbands and wives struggling with the staggering costs of nursing home care for a spouse have new protections against the threat of poverty under rules that kick in this month as part of the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> catastrohic health insurance program. The `` spousal impoverishment'' rules have broad support on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and appear safe from repeal as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> debates whether to scrap major provisions of the catastrophic-care package to appease senior citizens angry at the costs of the coverage. The new nursing home protections most typically will benefit older women who might otherwise be left destitute when their husbands are institutionalized at costs averaging more than $ 25,000 a year, advocates say. In the past, Medicaid would help pay nursing home bills only after couples spent most assets and income of the institutionalized spouse, often leaving the at-home spouse little to live on. `` It was really a very tragic situation,'' said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> of the Older Women's League. `` With women living on average about eight years longer than men, these older women were forced to live out their remaining years in poverty.'' Attorney <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemore </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said that if most of a couple's assets and income were listed in the name of the spouse who went into the nursing home, `` you could lose pretty much everything.'' Some couples were driven to divorce to establish court-ordered property and income rights for the non-institutionalized spouse. A 1987 congressional study found that the high costs of nursing-home care were quickly exhausting many couples' resources, leaving more than half of all couples impoverished within six months after one spouse entered a nursing home. About 15 percent of the nation's 1.5 million nursing home residents are married. `` Most often it is the wife who remains in the community, and she often is left with little or no money with which to meet her own health care and other needs,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging reported last year. Under rules that took effect Sept. 30 and being implemented by states this month, the spouse in the community will be able to keep more of the couple's combined assets and income. Where couples in the past could qualify for Medicaid help only after spending all but about $ 2,000 - $ 3,000 in assets other than their homes and certain personal belongings, now they will be able to keep $ 12,000 - $ 60,000, depending on the level set by their The minimum monthly income allowed in the past was set at the Supplemental Security Income level, $ 368 in 1989, but now rises to 122 percent of poverty, or $ 815, and will increase to 133 percent in July 1991 and 150 percent in July 1992. States will be allowed to let couples keep up to $ 1,500 a month in 1989, with the maximum rising in future years. Income and asset limits could be even higher if ordered by the courts. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Families </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, an advocacy group for the elderly, said that while the new protection does n't solve the problem of rising costs for long-term care, `` it certainly provides tremendous relief. `` For somebody who has lived relatively well, the amount they can keep still may be seen as a hardship, but for those of moderate to middle income, it is going to substantially improve the protection that they had before,'' <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that in fiscal 1990 the new protections will cost the federal government $ 165 million and state governments $ 135 million. The federal share will rise to $ 245 million in 1991 and the state share to $ 200 million. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rother </PERSON>, legislative director for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>, said the costs are `` a drop in the bucket'' yet produce a benefit that is `` a real lifesaver'' for many older Americans. `` It does n't do anything for the person without a spouse, but it does protect many of the people who've sacrificed the most,'' husbands and wives who already have spent years taking care of a spouse at home, <PERSON> Rother </PERSON> said. The new impoverishment rules were enacted as part of a program to insure the elderly against the costs of catastrophic illness, but even before all the program's benefits have taken effect, many senior citizens are demanding its repeal because they say it is too costly. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is expected to scrap much of the program or cut it back, but even legislators leading the call for repeal favor preserving the new impoverishment rules as a worthwhile and inexpensive protection. Advocates for the elderly, meanwhile, say that even if the whole catastrophic program survives, the nation still needs a solution to the high costs of long-term care, largely overlooked in the package. `` Spousal impoverishment is a result of the fact that our health care system does n't cover these costs,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>. `` We still need some sort of public program that provides protection for the really catastrophic costs of nursing and home health care.''

<HEAD>Unusual Home For Seniors Provides Alternative To Nursing Home</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiel </PERSON> is 80, nearly blind and ca n't live on her own. Yet she bristles at talk of a nursing home. But Wiel lives at <ORGANIZATION> Tam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a communal home on a tree-lined street in the shadow of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tamalpais </LOCATION>, with seven other women and two men. Its directors call <ORGANIZATION> Tam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> an idea whose time has come; residents are simply thankful it exists. `` It's perfect for someone like me. I needed to be around people but I needed to be independent and on my own,'' said <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 70, who moved in 18 months ago after separating from her husband of 46 years. Now <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> spends her time gardening, playing bingo, visiting nearby senior centers and hiking six miles a day. `` It's great to be able to walk to a good trout fishing lake from your home,'' she said. <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON>, 79, came to <ORGANIZATION> Tam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after staying with a cousin on his houseboat in <LOCATION> Sausalito </LOCATION>. Now she would n't feel comfortable going back. `` If I did n't live here, I could n't afford to live anywhere else,'' she said. The 7-year-old, private, non-profit home owned and operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecumenical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, offers more independence than a board-and-care home, while fostering companionship and support. Although there is a waiting list, there has n't always been. Communal living is n't for everyone. It took more than a year to fill the six-bedroom main house and four-bedroom annex, said <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> RVEHA </ORGANIZATION> executive director. `` It was a new idea. Shared living was not a real popular idea with seniors.'' Many wanted their own apartment and were reluctant to squeeze a lifetime's belongings into a bedroom, <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> said. And for many, <ORGANIZATION> Tam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also is the first time they've lived with a group since they were youngsters. Tam House is the product of a group of local church members who started meeting in 1975 to discuss senior housing. In 1980, they found the house, which was bought and renovated with federal development funds. Residents must be at least 55 and able to live independently when they move in. Rents range from $ 400 to $ 425 a month, including dinner and food for do-it-yourself breakfasts. Operating costs were $ 78,780 in 1988, <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> said. Advocates for the elderly expect shared group housing to become increasingly common among seniors. `` It's very common among young people, it's just not been an acceptable mode of living among old people until recently,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Caulfield </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Marin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on Aging. `` I think it is an extraordinarily viable concept but it takes the right mix of people.'' This year, for the first time, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> expanded its senior housing program to include funds for such shared group residences. For those who do n't mind paring down, group housing offers a balance of privacy and company. <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON>'s tidy room disguises the fact that she has boxes and crates under the bed, jammed in the closet and covered with afghans in the corner. Little things can rankle, she admitted, laughing at her own annoyance when others forget to refill the ice cube tray or replace a roll of toilet paper. But the good outweighs the bad, she said. Tam House is within walking distance of shopping, restaurants, entertainment and public transit. Although residents must be independent, <ORGANIZATION> Tam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is small enough to accommodate changes. <PERSON> Wiel </PERSON>'s glaucoma has reduced her vision since she moved in so `` that they would n't take me this way now.'' But residents help her with chores, and all agree she is coping remarkably well with her handicap. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>, 81, is a senior member of the house, having moved in in 1983. Boxes of files create a maze-like pattern on his floor, and books and more files practically spill off the bookshelves. A portable computer hums in the corner. <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> is writing his memoirs. He is a survivor of German concentration camps and was a spy for the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> who worked to rescue Jews during World War II. He was imprisoned for refusing to divorce his Jewish wife, who escaped. Family photos hang on the wall beside framed commendations from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Although his two daughters have each offered to share their homes, <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> will never accept. `` I would have the feeling that I am burdening someone. We have a wonderful relationship but I would n't want to encroach on their privacy. Even if you have a big house, it's a problem to have old people around.'' Although only one person, who had a drinking problem, has been evicted, <ORGANIZATION> Tam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> residents are sensitive to the ruptures that conflicts can cause. <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> said he is sometimes bothered by noise but uses earplugs rather than complain because `` it would establish a certain tension.'' `` This is 10 crotchety old people,'' said <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, 81. `` We're all set in our ways before we get here. It's simply amazing how we all get along.''

 <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> has retired from a 27-year <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> career that included the command of two ships, but he's still giving plenty of orders. `` You ca n't do anything now but sit in your seat.'' `` I want everything off the desk.'' `` Listen to me. If you're not listening, you're not going to do well.'' The orders are directed at fourth - and fifth-graders at <ORGANIZATION> Larchmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, 50, became their teacher this year after completing an Old Dominion University program that offers a master's degree and teaching certification to retiring military personnel. `` I believe that I can help these kids,'' the former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> commander said of his 16 students, all of whom have failed a grade and have difficulty learning. Between commanding a destroyer and a salvage ship, <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> spent much of his career teaching ROTC courses. Fed up with administrative work, he chose his new career because it lets him work with a small number of students all day long. <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> is one of the first graduates of the Old Dominion program, which has attracted 162 military personnel nearing retirement. All but four are men. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, professor of educational curriculum and instruction at Old Dominion, has no trouble recruiting students or finding schools for them. `` The school divisions are calling and asking for these guys,'' said <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>. Their military backgrounds make them good planners, counselors and negotiators, and `` all those are teacher skills. They also bring to education just extensive life experiences.'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has found the retired officers are no more authoritarian than anyone else. They are unfamiliar with young children, though, so the program sends them into the schools to talk with students and teachers before they decide whether teaching is right for them. A half-dozen have done their student teaching at <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION>, where Assistant Principal <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> DuLaney </PERSON> said, `` They're wonderful. They come in with a lot of experiences that we can use. They're used to dealing with the public. They've got lots of managerial skills.'' One Indian River mother wanted to know if her son could have a retired military officer for his teacher again this year because the one her son had last year was the only teacher who ever made him work, Ms. <PERSON> DuLaney </PERSON> said. The military retirees also provide good role models for teen-age boys, she said. `` For so many of our kids the father figure is absent.'' Similar programs are offered in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, which have large military populations, but <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dominion </ORGANIZATION>'s is the largest, said <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> Many of the retired officers are interested in teaching math or science, both areas where teacher shortages have developed. <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> went into his new job with realistic expectations, so he's had few surprises. He has learned that teaching rambunctious children takes a lot more patience than giving orders to sailors on a ship. `` It takes an awful lot of patience and you have to grab every success that you have and remember it because the successes are few and long in coming.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karp </PERSON> is only 45 but he's convinced his worst years are just around the corner. <PERSON> Karp </PERSON> is n't afraid of old age, he just fears the 50s. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> sociologist believes too much attention is paid to the trauma of turning 30, the midlife crises of the 40s and the infirmities of old age. The 50s may be the most neglected decade _ and the most frightening. The 50s, he says, is when one's mortality first comes sharply into focus `` The basic idea of the science of aging is how other people define us,'' said <PERSON> Karp </PERSON>, who studied 72 people between 50 and 60. `` You're as young or old as other people make you feel. `` I think that during the 50s, those messages pick up steam. During this period, people begin to think in terms of how long they have to live.'' Writing in a recent issue of The Gerontologist, in a piece titled `` A Decade of Reminders,'' <PERSON> Karp </PERSON> outlines the ominous signs of aging that appear for the first time in the 50s. He begins with the `` body reminders.'' `` In the 50s, people's bodies begin to betray them. Some develop life-threatening disabilities. For others, it's as simple as playing ball with your kid and noticing you ca n't throw the ball that far anymore.'' Then come the `` generational reminders.'' Those in their 50s are `` sandwiched'' between generations in a way that makes them face their own growing limitations, <PERSON> Karp </PERSON> said. Their elderly parents may be aging rapidly or about to die, and their children may be growing more independent, often making them grandparents. Finally, there are `` contextual'' reminders, like the perennial Wunderkind who suddenly realizes his days as a whiz kid are long over. `` People find themselves the oldest in many settings. People want you to be their mentor. People start to read the obituary pages. Collectively, they give rise to a changing conception of time _ they recognize the finiteness of time. `` The sharpness of the recognition that you're aging, the discrepancy between mental and physical selves, becomes harder and harder to maintain.'' Men and women may cope with these psychological crises differently. By their early 50s, men, especially professionals, have usually reached the peak of the their careers, <PERSON> Karp </PERSON> said. It's often depressing to them to realize they may never go higher. But many women who sublimated career ambitions to home and family may have just joined the work force in their 40s. They feel they still have a lot to do. `` Whereas men in their 50s are beginning to develop an exit consciousness, women ca n't even thing about it,'' <PERSON> Karp </PERSON> said. But all is not just `` doom and gloom,'' he said. Though the signs of aging are there, `` nothing is said. Married couples in their 50s, their children often already launched, may live together for another 15 years. `` People are working longer. At the same time, many of the people talk about a growing wisdom. They see things more holistically. They look forward to life. They sometimes see the empty nest as a liberating time.''

 Journalism careers begin humbly under <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON>, a 93-year-old patriarch of the profession who starts the process by having bright young students restock newspaper vending machines. <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON> teaches an old school of journalism, the small-town kind known unkindly in big-city newsrooms as `` chicken dinner news.'' It's the toughest journalism there is, and the most important, he believes. <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON> bought the <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crier </LOCATION> for his students and the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ignace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> for himself. At both weeklies, reporters and interns write about ice cream socials and summer parades. They sell ads, take subscriptions, paste up the paper and collect quarters from the stands. They also probe social issues and pry truth from rumor. And they listen for the beat of the community heart. `` The idea to know about journalism is to know the whole thing,'' <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON> says. That means living with the people you write about and to whom you sell the stories and the ads. Shed your cynicism and tell readers of their own decency, grace and commonweal, <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON> says. You might not expect to learn such high ideals selling ads for an obstinate man who can hardly hear, who sits dwarfed in his dim office beneath a wall of books, ripping into newspaper stories. Here is a man who advocates such old-school and now taboo ideas as doctoring quotes to improve their clarity. Some of <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON>'s students start their summers on <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> thinking they're entering a museum. The necessity for reporters to cover their beats by riding bicycles on the motorless island does n't help. `` I think they look at him, in a way, just as an old man. I hate to see it but I know where it's coming from,'' said one of <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON>'s disciples, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, a publisher who came out of retirement to be advertising manager `` I know they respect him but they wonder with his age that he might be out of touch with reality. ... They look at him as a stodgy old professor. `` Then, all of a sudden, it's a rude awakening. Here's this man tearing into their copy and they're not prima donnas anymore.'' There is more to <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON> than this. He works every day of every week and always wears a suit with a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> pin _ he joined the faculty in 1928 and was journalism chairman for two decades starting in 1947 _ and a tie with a perfect <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> knot, even when weeding his beloved roses. Sunday mornings, he gathers his interns for three-hour lectures on topics ranging from the Cold War to why papers did n't sell. `` He called me back into his office once and I thought there was something wrong with one of my stories,'' said former <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ignace </LOCATION> reporter <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Esper </PERSON>, now at the <ORGANIZATION> Ironwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. `` Instead, he leans back in his chair and says ` Light can illuminate but it can also blind.''' Vintage <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON>. The reporters he has coached, encouraged and tormented have gone on to become correspondents, editors and publishers around the world. `` He is a terrific teacher, a very stimulating fellow. He makes you think,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottschalk </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON>'s first island interns, now senior writer for the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> bureau of the Wall Street Journal. <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON>'s students tell of a relentless teacher and perfectionist. The idiosyncrasies are tolerated. The ideologies are cherished. `` I feel every moment I can spend with him is worthwhile. He is forever the teacher,'' says senior intern <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Reavie </PERSON>. `` I know new students see this 90-year-old man waddling around and they say, ` What can he do for us?' But they genuinely love the man at the end of the summer.'' And how <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON> loves them. `` I get always connected with young people. It's a delight. I find them interesting.'' Age now is wedging itself between <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON> and the business he loves. Bypass surgery last fall knocked him off his feet. `` Despite doctors' orders, he would come down here and be on his feet to check the paper,'' <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said. `` He was just obstinate. I know he had said to me at one time when he was recovering, that he thought it could be the beginning of the end. `` I had never seen that attitude in him.'' <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON> has, however, turned over more of the daily newspaper work to his son, <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and to <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>. Neither man has a journalism degree, but both are lifelong students of <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON>'s community news `` I'm an old man who does n't know when to retire,'' <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON> says. `` As long as I can, I will do some kind of work, because I think that keeps you alive.''

 A revolution called Xeriscape is sweeping home and public landscapes of the West. Manicured lawns and carefully tended plants seem out of place. Native plants requiring minimal care and water are popular. Water shortages are the primary catalyst, of course. But the big push comes when folks realize many native plants are things of beauty that can be grown with minimal effort and expense. In <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, for example, a water department brochure suggests a number of outstanding plants that grow well with little or no water beyond what nature provides, and reports savings of from 30 percent to 60 percent. `` Lots of greenery does not have to mean lots of water,'' says a brochure published by the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>; the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>; the Salt River Project, which manages reservoirs; and the cities of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>. `` Xeriscape News'' is the official publication of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Xeriscape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 940 E. 51st <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 78751. A recent edition featured the opening of a xeriscape garden in a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> park, though most material is aimed at the average homeowner. The more than 50 Xeriscape projects nationwide include a demonstration garden in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON>. The national council has trademarked the term Xeriscape to prevent its use as a product or corporate name for private gain. The Xeriscape concept, which means water conservation through creative landscaping, is generally credited to a 1981 idea of the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The idea, of course, has been around for years, especially in the arid <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>. One of the earliest advocates was <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, then a professor of landscape architecture at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION>. He won hoots of derision when he first suggested limiting lawns to 10-by-10 feet. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, now retired, is a director of the national council, and removing most of the lawn is generally the first recommendation to homeowners switching from conventional landscaping. The second recommendation is to use plants adapted to one's area, grouping them according to moisture, light, climate and other needs `` Be sure to learn the needs of any plant and have a use for it in your landscape before purchase,'' advises the <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Range </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Xeriscape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. The concept involves using numerous attractive trees, shrubs, flowers and ground covers, plus mulches. Pruning, weeding, fertilizing, pest control and similar maintenance often is n't required because of plant adaptability While low water use is a must, there is some dispute over whether this is a sufficient criteria. `` Few things are more beautiful than our desert's natural low-care, low-water-using plants,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Breunig </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>'s Desert Botanical Garden. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichardt </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Native </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, says `` our native mesquites, desert willows, palo verdes and acacias help to distinguish'' the state. `` Olives, eucalyptus and Italian cypress are examples of things that will thrive in <LOCATION> Perth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, as well as here. If we focus only on water-saving plants, we open the doors to their widespread use.'' <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> assistant professor of landscape architecture, recently studied the landscaping value of the native palo verde and the non-native mulberry, a popular shade tree in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. Starting with 5-year-old trees, he found it cost $ 25 a year more to irrigate the mulberry although it provided about equivalent savings in air conditioning. Most native trees also grow much quicker than non-native ones. The desert willow, for example, can grow three feet a year in the the summer before reaching its eventual height of around 25 feet. And it's always included in lists of highly desirable local trees.

<TEXT>
 More than half of all cancers occur in people 65 and older, but many people mistakenly assume that once they reach retirement age they are powerless to prevent the disease _ that it's just too late to try. Age is one of the greatest risk factors for developing cancer. At 25, the chance of being diagnosed with cancer within five years is one in 700; at 65 it is one in 14. However, scientists are convinced we can improve those odds. It's never too late to prevent cancer. Here's how. Stop smoking. Cigarette smoking causes 85 percent of lung cancers in men and 75 percent in women. Smokers also are more likely to develop cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, pancreas and bladder. Once you quit _ no matter what your age _ your risk of cancer begins to decline right away. Eat a variety of good foods. Researchers have found that a high-fat diet increases the risk of breast, colon and prostate cancers, which are common in older people; a well-balanced diet reduces the risk. In particular, eat more high-fiber foods -LRB- whole-grain cereals, fruits and vegetables -RRB- and fewer fatty foods -LRB- butter, cream and high-fat cheese -RRB-. It's not as hard as it sounds. You do n't have to give up all of the foods you like; eat more of the foods that reduce your risk of cancer and less of those that increase it. Drink alcohol only in moderation. Cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus and liver occur more often among heavy drinkers of alcohol. Avoid too much sun. Almost all skin cancers are caused by exposure to the sun. Repeated exposure is especially dangerous for people with fair skin and those who freckle easily. The sun is strongest from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sunscreen lotions and protective clothing, like a hat or long-sleeved shirt, can help. Use hormones carefully. Estrogen has been associated with higher-than-average rates of uterine cancer. Women who take it to relieve hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause should discuss the benefits and risks with their doctor. In addition to changing your lifestyle, enlist your doctor. The chances of surviving cancer are greatest with early detection and prompt treatment. Even before symptoms appear, doctors can detect cancers of the breast, colon, prostate and cervix. As part of your regular checkup, your doctor may recommend a number of tests to look for these and other forms of cancer. For example, all women should have their breasts examined regularly by a doctor, and should learn how to perform monthly breast self-examination. After menopause, women should examine their breasts the same day each month. An X-ray of the breast -LRB- mammogram -RRB- can detect a cancer too small to be felt. Beginning at 50, women should have a mammogram each year or as recommended by a doctor. Men and women over 40 should have a digital rectal exam on an initial visit to a primary care doctor and at least every three years after that. This is the most reliable test for prostate cancer in men; it also can detect cancer of the rectum in men and women. The stool blood test for rectal and colon cancers is recommended yearly after age 50. In addition, most cancer specialists recommend sigmoidoscopy, an examination of the colon and rectum with a thin, hollow, lighted instrument which can detect cancer and noncancerous growths. This exam is recommended at least once after age 50 and then every three to five years after two negative exams a year apart. Most cases of cervical cancer could be prevented if every woman had a Pap test and pelvic exam regularly. The Pap test detects cancerous cells in and around the cervix. After women have normal test results three years in a row, their doctors may suggest they have a Pap test less often. Many people automatically attribute aches and pains to growing older. They may ignore their symptoms, assuming they are an unavoidable part of aging. Most symptoms are not serious, but only a doctor can tell for sure. To be safe, tell your doctor about any unusual symptoms that last two weeks or more. Cancer frightens everyone. But many older people are reluctant to discuss it with their families or doctors because they believe a number of myths about the disease and its treatment. When they grew up, nothing could stop cancer's deadly progress. Even the word was whispered behind the patient's back. Today, however, many cancers can be treated successfully if found early. Even better news is that the chances of surviving are greater than ever. The best news of all is that many cancers can even be prevented.

<TEXT>
 Blind Americans aged 60 and over will be recruited as volunteers to help other visually handicapped elderly people under a project being launched as part of the government's Senior Companion Program <ORGANIZATION> SCP </ORGANIZATION> announced Sept. 15 that it had awarded a $ 220,000 grant to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the <PERSON> Blind </PERSON>, which will help find and train visually impaired senior volunteers and locate other blind seniors who need help. The Senior Companion Program uses low-income citizens 60 and older to provide care and companionship to other adults to help them live independently. The program is sponsored by ACTION, the federal domestic volunteer agency. Acting ACTION Director <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> said the new program targeting the blind is designed `` to focus attention on the abilities of the disabled.'' Under the grant, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blind </ORGANIZATION> will assist four local <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION> in developing two-year demonstration projects, which have not been selected.

 More than 3 million Americans ignore leg ache, pain or cramps during walking or exercise as simply signs of aging, but they could have an easily diagnosed and treated disease that could be incapacitating. Peripheral arterial disease is a narrowing or blockage of arteries, generally in the lower abdomen or extremities and especially in the legs. The most common cause is atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. P.A.D. most often afflicts people over 50 and has most commonly hit men, though women also are at increased risk because more women are smoking. Other risk factors include diabetes, hypertension and high fat levels in the blood. `` P.A.D. is easily treated if detected in its early stages,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilo </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. LEG ALERT, a 3-year-old program established by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst-Roussel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has screened over 34,000 people.

<HEAD>Outreach Program Aims to Increase Access to Government Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An advocacy group for older Americans is expanding its outreach program to help more elderly and disabled poor people get the government benefits to which they are eligible. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION> said it will help people in 30 communities nationwide learn about and apply for Medicaid, food stamps, low-income home energy assistance and Supplemental Security Income benefits. The outreach program earlier had been planned for 10 cities and was focused on helping eligible people obtain <ORGANIZATION> SSI </ORGANIZATION> benefits, which provide a minimal income floor for the nation's blind, aged and disabled. A pilot SSI outreach program in 1988 in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, resulted in a 97 percent increase in <ORGANIZATION> SSI </ORGANIZATION> applications and a 58 percent jump in SSI awards, <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> said. Training, community presentations and publicity are among the methods used to reach people who may be eligible for benefits, the group said. <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION>'s expanded outreach program, scheduled to run through 1990, is being financed with help from The <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Elderly People Living Alone. Cities to be included in the project will be selected after local organizations apply to assist in the outreach program.

<HEAD>Billions Wasted on Unneeded Medical Care, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans waste billions of dollars on unneeded medical costs while nearly half the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population ca n't pay for decent care, says a report to a congressional study group Witnesses before the panel recommend national health insurance, national care standards to avoid unnecessary treatments, an emphasis on preventive medicine, and a shift of more research dollars to health problems affecting the elderly, according to the report. The American health care system is `` expensive, wasteful and denies millions of Americans even the most basic medical attention,'' Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said today in releasing the report. `` We spend $ 1.5 billion a day on health care, much more as a share of GNP than any other industrialized nation,'' he said. `` Are we getting our money's worth? Absolutely not.'' The report was based on nine days of hearings conducted in 1988 by the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on education and health, chaired by <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON>. The 18-member committee is a bipartisan economic advisory group with membership weighted in favor of the majority party. Some of the findings: _ Of the $ 500 billion spent in 1988 by Americans on health care, $ 125 billion was spent on unneeded tests and procedures, including many caesarean sections, pacemaker implants and coronary bypasses Paperwork imposes a $ 20 surcharge on every $ 100 spent for health care, with malpractice premiums adding to that. _ Some 37 million Americans have no insurance, 70 million more are underinsured and 23 million are served by Medicaid, which has declined in its ability to provide basic or equitable coverage The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population is 240 million. _ Twelve percent of the population is 65 and older, a group that generates high health care costs That will grow to one in four in 2050, with 20 percent of that group expected to be 85 and over. Yet while incontinence, dementia and arthritis, all problems of the elderly, produce $ 60 billion a year in health care costs, only $ 200 million is spent annually on research to combat those afflictions. The report recommended that until national health insurance can be provided, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> must be required to implement a fee schedule and encourage preferred provider organizations. Those are physicians who meet cost, quality and volume expectations. Standards of care must be developed to prevent unnecessary treatments, it said. People must be encouraged to develop good habits _ such as diet and exercise _ that will prevent illness, the report said, adding that research priorities `` must be drastically reordered'' to focus on diseases of the elderly. It also suggested seeking alternatives to malpractice lawsuits. The subcommittee members are Reps. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif.; <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON>; <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>; and Sens <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Tenn.; and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif

<TEXT>
 Land prices in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s residential areas have fallen for the first time since the government began keeping records in 1975, but real estate costs have been rising elsewhere in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a report released Monday said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said residential land prices in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> were down 4.4 percent as of July 1 from 1988, when they rose 8.1 percent. The highest residential land price in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was $ 88,000 a square meter, or 10.76 square feet, in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> area, said an agency official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official declined to say who lives there, but <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> lives in an apartment house in that area, and owns his apartment. Last year's highest price was $ 79,000 a square meter. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s most expensive commercial land was $ 254,000 a square meter at the site of a building of <ORGANIZATION> Meidi-Ya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a trading firm, in the <LOCATION> Ginza </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s leading shopping district. That area also was most expensive last year, at $ 242,000, the official said. He said the report was based on a survey of land prices conducted on July 1 at 25,216 spots throughout the nation. The official said the nation's average land price went up by 6.8 percent from a year earlier in residential areas and 7.5 percent in commercial areas, compared with 7.4 percent for residential land and 8.0 percent for commercial land last year. In <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> and neighboring areas in western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, residential land prices rose 37.3 percent from a year earlier, compared with an increase of 26.9 percent last year.

<TEXT>
 The company that held a monopoly on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s international telephone service will cut its rates by 14 percent next month to compete with two new rivals, officials said Monday <ORGANIZATION> Kokusai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Denshin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Denwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Ltd. began receiving telephone service competition Sunday from the new <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> The new companies started with service to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, the two places called most frequently from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, company officials said. <ORGANIZATION> IDC </ORGANIZATION> plans to extend its services to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> later this year, and to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> next year, company spokesman <PERSON> Koyo </PERSON> <PERSON> Taura </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> ITJ </ORGANIZATION> said it also would be serving <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> by November, and such places as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> next year. Government officials said they hoped the new competition would help the international telephone business grow in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. While domestic phone calls produce about $ 33.7 billion a year in profit, the international phone business in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been worth only $ 1.44 billion in annual profit, said <PERSON> Takaharu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Two years ago, the average Japanese called overseas only once a year, he said. The two newcomers' normal daytime rates for three-minute calls to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are $ 4.86, lower than <ORGANIZATION> KDD </ORGANIZATION>'s current $ 6.35, <PERSON> Taura </PERSON> said. The Post and <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s recent approval for <ORGANIZATION> KDD </ORGANIZATION>'s percent rate cut starting Nov. 1, to $ 5.20, would narrow the price gap, making competition keener, he added. <ORGANIZATION> KDD </ORGANIZATION> has reduced its rates nine times since 1979, said <ORGANIZATION> KDD </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Shinichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Terada </PERSON>. The largest reduction was last year's 21 percent cut, said the post ministry's <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> long has been criticized for expensive international phone call rates. `` It used to be almost twice as expensive to call from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, we admit that,'' <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> said. But the gap has been narrowing, and will narrow further with healthy competition in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> added. Currrently, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest long distance carrier, charges $ 6.02 for a three-minute daytime call to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a competitor, charges $ 5.67, <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> said.

 The stock market declined slightly today, getting off to a sluggish start on the last quarter of 1989. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 4.37 to 2,688.45 in the first half hour of trading. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 371 up, 548 down and 474 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 16.07 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Analysts said prices backtracked a bit in the absence of the end-of-quarter buying by investing institutions that helped support the market last week. They said the atmosphere was characterized more by an absence of demand than by any pickup in selling pressure. The results of a monthly survey of corporate purchasing executives, released this morning, showed continued softness in the manufacturing sector of the economy during September. But brokers noted that the report contained few surprises for investors, and actually indicated a modest improvement from August. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> rose -RRB- to 109 |; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> gained \ to 56 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> dropped \ to 29 -LCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> was down \ at 46 -LRB- The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks fell .26 to 193.71.

 Construction spending rose 1.8 percent in August, its first advance in three months and the largest this year, the government said today in a report indicating the building industry may be pulling out of its slump. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said spending increased $ 7.3 billion to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 421.8 billion last month. That followed decreases of 0.6 percent in July and 0.8 percent in June. Spending rose 1.4 percent in May. The August advance was the biggest since a 2.3 percent gain in December 1988. It was thought earlier the industry decline had bottomed out when the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that July construction spending posted a tiny fractional increase of 0.02 percent. However, additional information caused a downward revision in that report. Analysts have been looking for a pickup in construction spending ever since interest rates began falling earlier in the year. Fixed-rate mortgage rates declined from a peak of 11.22 percent in March to 10.22 at the end of August, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In today's report, the department said residential construction dropped a miniscule 0.05 percent to an annual rate of $ 198.9 billion, with single-family construction off 0.2 percent to an annual rate of $ 113.1 billion. Apartment buildings gained 0.4 percent to $ 23.5 billion on an annual rate. Non-residential construction showed a 2.9 percent increase to an annual rate of $ 100.3 billion. A 4.5 percent increase in office buildings and a 1.8 percent gain in factory buildings led the advance. Government construction rose 5.3 percent to an annual rate of $ 86 billion as the largest government category, highway building, rebounded 4.2 percent after falling 4.5 percent in July. The total construction figure was up 3.4 percent from the level of building a year ago.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s `` bullet train,'' named for its shape and high-speed, is 25 years old. The train began service on Oct. 1, 1964, running at speeds of up to 131 miles an hour and making the 324-mile run between <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>, in western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, in 3 hours, 20 minutes. `` Since then, the bullet trains have carried 2.7 billion passengers between <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Tomoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimokawa </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railways </ORGANIZATION>, the private company that replaced the government-owned railroad in April 1987. The train never has been involved in a major accident. The introduction of bullet train services in 1964, shortly before the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Olympic Games, was seen as a symbol of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s remarkable postwar economic recovery The <LOCATION> Tokyo-Osaka </LOCATION> run has since been cut to three hours, with trains running at up to 138 miles an hour, Ms. <PERSON> Shimokawa </PERSON> said Monday. In 1975, the original line from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> was extended past <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hakata </LOCATION>, on the southernmost main island of <LOCATION> Kyushu </LOCATION>, 563 miles west of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. In the late 1980s, new lines were added from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Morioka </LOCATION>, 289 miles to the north, and from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Niigata </LOCATION>, 160 miles northwest of the capital. The fastest train on the line to <LOCATION> Morioka </LOCATION> runs at up to 150 miles an hour, the railway says.

 <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said today it was selling its fast-growing computer group to the French company <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bull </ORGANIZATION> to concentrate on consumer electronics, the weaker segment of its business. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> is the last major U.S.-headquartered manufacturer of televisions, a business that has usually lost money for the company in recent years. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement it expected the purchase price for the computer business to be less than $ 635 million, with the exact amount to be based on the net asset value of the computer business when the deal is closed, probably by the end of the year. The deal is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. Sales of <LOCATION> Glenview </LOCATION>, Ill.-based <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s computer systems and components expanded by 23 percent to $ 1.6 billion last year compared to a 2.7 percent increase in consumer-electronics sales, which totaled $ 1.1 billion. Despite its fast growth, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> said the computer business was saddled with a large amount of debt that had restricted <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to realize the full potential of its consumer electronics division. `` <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> will emerge as a conservatively financed company better prepared to capitalize on our strengths in consumer electronics,'' <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> said it will concentrate on `` new consumer electronics and component technologies, particularly high-definition television and advanced high-resolution color displays.'' <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s stock surged more than $ 2 a share, to $ 16.75 from Friday's close of $ 14.50, in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> estimated the book value of <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s stock after the sale at $ 19 a share. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the deal represented good value for stockholders. He said that with the proceeds from the sale, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> could retire about $ 300 million of its debt load and invest heavily in emerging video technologies such as high-definition television and its own flat-mask video display, an industry standard. `` This takes a company in the red that was becoming quite financially shaky into very sound financial condition,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said the company had $ 167 million in short-term debt and $ 309 million in long-term debt at the end of the second quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> turned a profit of $ 11.7 million last year _ its first annual profit in four years _ but had a net loss of $ 17 million for the first half of 1989.

 More than 350 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> members walked off their jobs in two states today in a strike against coal mines the union claims are filling orders for the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, subject of a months-long strike. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> ordered selective strikes at <ORGANIZATION> Sunglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rob </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> to begin at midnight Sunday, said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> representative. <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> and company officials today confirmed that the mines, with about 250 union workers total, had been shut down. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, about 120 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members went on strike today at five coal companies, a spokesman there said. `` The union found them doing business with <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>, they found them aligning themselves with them and supporting them,'' said <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, executive board member at <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 17 in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. He said `` there's no way to tell'' how long it will last. <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and company officials reported no problems on the picket lines, and <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said the situation was also peaceful in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Members of the union's international committee met Sunday with <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> Local 1468, representing about 200 Sunglo miners, and Local 1812, representing about 50 workers at Rob Fork Mining, formerly known as <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>. Both mines are in southern <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. `` They said they had solid proof -LRB- the mines -RRB- were selling coal to <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> and that's the reason the local is being called out on selective strike,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Spartman </PERSON>, an officer of Local 1468. The companies affected in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, all in <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, are the <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> H </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Auger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Can </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, Well said. About 1,700 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members went on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> in April after working more than a year without a contract. Among the issues the union has been unable to resolve with <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> include insurance and pension benefits, and hiring non-union labor. Wildcat strikes related to the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> dispute affected tens of thousands of union miners at other companies in June and July. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, superintendent of <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Fork </PERSON> Mine 29 and processing plant, said he did n't know if the company was filling <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s orders He said the company has salesmen who handle coal shipments but could not provide their names or any other details. There was no comment from <LOCATION> Sunglo </LOCATION> mine manager I.C. <PERSON> Spotte </PERSON>. People who answered the telephone at one Sunglow mine said <PERSON> Spotte </PERSON> was at another mine, where there was no answer. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, co-administrator for <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 30 in <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Spotte </PERSON> has denied to the union that the company was helping <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>, but he was `` confident w can prove our case in any court of law that they are filling <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s order.'' <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> said the union is looking at other unspecified companies in the three states to see if they also are assisting <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 An importer of fine Spanish porcelain that accuses another company of illegally selling the product in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at a discount lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal today. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that permitted the so-called `` gray market'' import of Lladro porcelain. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> had ruled last May in favor of <ORGANIZATION> Jalyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and against <ORGANIZATION> Weil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ceramics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm. The appeals court relied in part on a 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that upheld a lion's share of the multibillion-dollar gray market. The justices said then that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> does not have to shut down the gray market _ famous-name, foreign-made goods bearing valid <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trademarks sold in this country at reduced prices without approval from trademark owners. <ORGANIZATION> Weil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ceramics </ORGANIZATION> is a wholly owned subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Lladro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exportadora </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Weil </PERSON> became the exclusive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> distributor of the hand-made porcelain in 1966, and later was acquired by the Spanish company. <ORGANIZATION> Jalyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its president, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dash </PERSON>, began importing Lladro porcelain in 1982. <PERSON> Weil </PERSON>, seeking to collect damages and block the rival imports, sued <PERSON> Jalyn </PERSON> over alleged trademark infringement. The 3rd Circuit court rejected <PERSON> Weil </PERSON>'s arguments that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 ruling does not apply to it because it is the independent owner of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trademark for Lladro porcelain. `` Although <PERSON> Weil </PERSON> was not a sham incorporated by <PERSON> Lladro </PERSON> with the specific intent to benefit from the protection of the trademark act, its present relationship with Lladro nonetheless presents the potential for undesired monopoly of the domestic -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- market,'' the appeals court said. <PERSON> Weil </PERSON> said it should have exclusive rights to sell the porcelain in this country because its marketing, promotion and distribution efforts have built the popularity of the Lladro name. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Weil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ceramics </ORGANIZATION> vs. Dash, 89-173.

Rumors of an impending Soviet corn purchase had simmered through the markets last week despite statements last month by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s grain-buying agency that the country would purchase no more grain this year.

 You have the assurance of a person with 60 years of experience that there will be no recession so long as interest rates remain high. That might sound odd, because conventional thinking associates high or rising interest rates with a downturn sometime in the future. This fellow says high rates will protect us from recession. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON> has been analyzing public and economic opinion for close to six decades, during the past three of them through information gathered from an average of 110 telephone calls a day, seven days a week. The staff of <ORGANIZATION> Sindlinger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> asks probing personal questions of a scientific sample of households, and obtains remarkably straight answers. Out of each interview comes about 95 pieces of information. The staff is especially interested in levels of income compared with six months earlier, and income expectations for the next six months. They ask about job security, and about the household's view of business six months ahead. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON>, a pioneer in consumer research, analyzes the data. Of late, that data has suggested a lot of Americans feel rather well-heeled. As usual, he wanted to know why and made sure his staff probed into the subject. Answer any question asked by a canny interviewer and you're likely to provide more information than you realize One bit of information stood out: People felt comfortable because they are getting good returns on their savings. This is part of what often is referred to as the wealth effect, although it is a lot more complicated than that. With banks deregulated _ remember the old days of 5.25 percent interest a year _ people know they can get good returns. To say that they have gone `` yield crazy'' may be an exaggeration, although <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON> used the term a couple of times. But they are squeezing every nickel they can out of their assets in savings bonds, certificates of deposit, corporate and junk bonds. It is an accepted dictum of market psychology that when consumers feel comfortable they are inclined to spend. This being so, says <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON>, there's a real question of whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can wrestle inflation by raising rates. But these people also carry a lot of debt, too. Sure they do, says <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON>, but never forget that you ca n't go into debt unless you have assets _ not just a nest egg of collateral but a good secure job too. This situation tends to feed inflation, but there is more: For the first time in seven years, <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON> is finding an ominous rise in the wage demands of service workers. That also is an inflationary sign. The stock market? <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON> is finding that while households might have debts, some of those debts are going to finance stock purchases, adding to the wealth effect. This debt situation, household and corporate, might cause problems down the road, but he believes the immediate impact is to sustain a relatively high level of stock prices, together with a sense of financial well-being. Many people feel capitalistic today, he said. About 20 years ago fewer than 25 percent of households had $ 100,000 of liquid assets. Now, he says, 55 percent do. It's a bullish feeling, even if $ 100,000 is n't what it used to be. As <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON> sees it, the household financial condition explains why <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats lost the battle of capital gains taxes. He says too many of their old constituents think of themselves as taxpayers rather than tax recipients. But the biggest lesson of all, he maintains, is for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. That August body, he says, appears to be in the position of trying to fight inflation via high interest rates, but is fueling it instead.

<HEAD>Court Opens Term With Rulings on Worker Safety, Energy Exploration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday allowed states to file criminal charges against companies accused of neglecting the health and safety of workers and limited <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s efforts to control offshore energy exploration. In another business-related decision as the court opened a new term, the justices refused to take up an antitrust controversy stemming from the once-planned acquisition by <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lipton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Celestial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seasonings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> two years ago. Competitor R.C. <ORGANIZATION> Bigelow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> had claimed in a federal lawsuit that a merger would create a monopoly. A federal judged favored <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON>, but an appeals court reinstated the suit, saying the deal, which was later canceled, was in apparent violation of antitrust laws. In the worker-safety decision, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> let stand a ruling in an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case that federal workplace regulations do n't bar state prosecutions Five officials of <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magnet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> await trial on charges of recklessly injuring 42 workers by exposing them to toxic chemicals, extreme heat and other unsafe conditions at a wire-coating plant. But <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Magnet Wire officials argued criminal charges should be dropped because the federal government pre-empted state prosecutions when it enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The company said worker safety should be part of uniform national standards. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last February ruled that state criminal law `` can provide a valuable and forceful supplement to insure that workers are adequately protected.'' In the case involving <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, the high court left intact rulings that allowed the federal government last year to sell leases on 5.6 million acres of <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s southwestern coast. The court turned away warnings by <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> and others that an oil spill in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> could do more environmental harm than the massive Exxon Valdez spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> last March. The disputed leases were sold for nearly $ 100 million after a federal judge and the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> rejected a challenge by <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> and numerous enviromental groups, fishing associations and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> communities. Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> voted to hear arguments in the case but four votes are needed to grant such review. In other business-related decisions Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>: _ Asked the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for its views on broadening the power of states to sue on behalf of gas consumers allegedly overcharged by utility companies _ Agreed to decide whether a federal law unfairly makes it too difficult for coal miners who contract `` black lung'' disease to obtain a lawyer's help when seeking benefits _ Agreed to decide whether farm workers who suffer transportation-related injuries may sue their employers after receiving worker-compensation benefits _ Decided to consider placing new limits on the ability of convicted criminals to avoid making restitution to their victims by declaring bankruptcy _ Refused to hear an appeal by non-union <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> state employees who oppose paying the equivalent of dues to a union that represents them in collective bargaining _ Refused to reinstate a $ 3.5 million damage award a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> television station owner won, and then lost, against <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ Let stand a ruling that allows the so-called `` gray market'' import of Lladro porcelain by permitting a firm to sell the product even though another company is the exclusive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> _ Let stand a $ 1.2 million bonus in fees awarded to the lawyers for consumers who sued over allegedly defective transmissions in some <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> cars _ Refused to disturb a state's ban on telephone solicitation for pre-arranged funerals

<TEXT>
 State legal and consumer officials said Monday that, after a successful sting operation, they were suing a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> company over alleged deceptive techniques in marketing the `` Contour Chair'' _ a chair advertised on television by entertainer <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Linkletter </PERSON>. Acting Attorney General <PERSON> Clarine </PERSON> <PERSON> Nardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Riddle </PERSON> said claims that the chairs, which are sold through presentations in customers' homes, were custom fitted for individual consumers were false She also said salesmen deceived buyers in offering senior-citizen and other discounts when there was no original retail price for the chair, which she said sells for anywhere from $ 2,800 to more than $ 4,000. The suit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Sept. 19, charges use of false and deceptive sales techniques by the distributor, <ORGANIZATION> Contour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lounge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Bensalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, its president, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinthan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and the manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Craftmatic-Contour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Trevose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. The suit seeks to have the company barred from doing business in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Riddle </PERSON> said that the state of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has already obtained a cease-and-desist order against the company and others _ <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, as well as the city of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> _ are trying. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernofsky </PERSON>, the lawyer for Craftmatic-Contour, said the company's sales techniques were standard in the business. `` I'm sorry for the way they feel, but ... Contour is really doing nothing that I've been able to determine ... that's wrong,'' <PERSON> Chernofsky </PERSON> said. He said the chairs are, in fact, `` custom made for each customer'' including the size, fabric and various configurations of `` viviration units'' _ vibrators and heating units _ preferred by each customer. All those factors, he said, affect the price of the chair, accounting for differences in prices that customers paid. <PERSON> Riddle </PERSON> said the sting included employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> posing as interested customers. The employees were secretly `` wired'' and taped the sales presentations that allegedly used false and deceptive claims, including offering discounts that did n't exist, according to Consumer Protection Commissioner <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heslin </PERSON>. `` This is an important case because these chairs are advertised extensively on television and also because we've had problems with their sales techniques before,'' <PERSON> Riddle </PERSON> said, adding that 281 of the chairs had been sold in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. She said the sales techniques violated terms of a court settlement two years ago between the company and the state. She also said that the salesmen claimed that the chairs were medical devices and endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and claimed that the company's sales materials and business practices had been approved by <PERSON> Riddle </PERSON>'s office. <PERSON> Chernofsky </PERSON> said the problems encountered in other states were not directly related to the chairs themselves, but with distributors who had difficulty filling orders. He said the company would vigorously challenge the allegations in court.

 A round of afternoon buying carried the stock market to a four-week high in light trading Monday, getting Wall Street off to a positive start on the last quarter of 1989. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 20.90 to 2,713.72, its highest close since it stood at 2,719.79 on Sept. 6. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 861 up, 598 down and 509 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 127.41 million shares, down from 155.30 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 150.85 million shares. Analysts said traders had been braced for a pullback in the absence of the end-of-quarter buying by investing institutions that helped support the market last week. But in early trading prices steadied after a brief and shallow decline, suggesting that the market faced little selling pressure. The results of a monthly survey of corporate purchasing executives, released this morning, showed continued softness in the manufacturing sector of the economy during September. Brokers noted, however, that the report contained few surprises for investors, and actually indicated a modest improvement from August. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>, which said it was looking for buyers for the oil and gas reserves of its <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gas subsidiary, climbed 1 -RCB- to 34 ~, making a health contribution to the Dow's gain <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, rose 1 -LCB- to 68 -LCB-.

<HEAD>Two-Year Extension of Coffee Agreement Is Backed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A two-year extension of the International Coffee Agreement has received the necessary backing of importing and exporting nations, allowing it to take effect without new provisions for price supports, officials said Monday. The announcement by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> coincided with the resumption of talks among coffee-trading nations aimed at reopening negotiations on a replacement accord. Some 41 exporting and 18 importing countries have notified the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> that they accept the extended coffee agreement, said <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltrao </PERSON>, the coffee organization's executive director. The backers include <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> and all other key exporters. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the world biggest importer, all members of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have also accepted the extended agreement. The agreement maintains the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> as a forum for discussing matters of mutual concern to exporters and importers including the shape of any possible new agreement on quotas. The coffee pact's price-support clauses, allowing exports to be controlled by quotas to stabilize prices, were suspended indefinitely on July 4. Since then, the market has dropped to a 14-year low, triggering efforts by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to bring coffee-trading nations back to the negotiating table to agree a new pact. But talks in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> last week failed to remove the obstacles in the way of reopening negotiations.

 <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Monday offered to sell the natural gas and oil reserves of its <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary in what is being viewed on Wall Street as a concession to shareholders <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gas has been a disappointment to <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> since it was acquired in 1986 in a $ 3 billion stock swap. `` I think shareholders have just lost their patience,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> is showing a willingness to part with assets that probably will appreciate if held long enough but could enhance the stock's value now by being sold, he said `` This is a very strong statement that they're committed to shareholders,'' <PERSON> Fleischer </PERSON> said. Chief among the shareholders who stand to benefit is corporate raider <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who is holding an 11 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fleischer </PERSON> and analyst <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracken </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> said they valued the reserves at around $ 1.5 billion.

The reserves are principally located in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>.

The sale, besides boosting <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gas's earnings, will help with <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>'s goal of reducing debt and may lead to the repurchase of stock or raise the dividend, he said. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> had been pinning its hopes for a turnaround at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gas on the prospect that natural gas prices will surge. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gas has 1.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in reserve, about a quarter of the 3.5 trillion cubic feet held by the other <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Marathon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gas has 28 million barrels of oil, or 3 percent of Marathon's 766 million The sale would not affect gas gathering, the bulk of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gas's business, or contract drilling, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> car sales should drop in 1990 although it expects its truck sales to increase, led by its new four-door Pathfinder sport-utility vehicle, a <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> executive said Monday. Overall, sales throughout the industry in 1990 will drop to about 14 million cars and trucks from nearly 15 million in 1989, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> Division of <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>, the Japanese company's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marketing arm. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s share of that market should be about 660,000 vehicles in each year. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales in 1990 should drop by about 0.8 percent but truck sales should rise by 2.5 percent. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> estimated the four-door Pathfinder would make up 90 percent of the vehicle's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of about 31,000 vehicles. About 24,000 two-door Pathfinders were sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the 1989 model year, but <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said that number would drop drastically because of price increases needed to recover tariff costs effective on the 1990 models. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, under rules announced earlier this year, classified the four-door version of the imported Pathfinder as a car, making it subject to a 2.5 percent tariff. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> officials had worried that the four-door Pathfinder would be classified as a truck, making it subject to a 25 percent import duty. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> now makes pickup trucks and Sentra automobiles at its <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, plant. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> projected that Sentra sales will fall to about 180,000 cars in the 1990 model year, down 21.1 percent from the 228,000 the company expects to sell in the 1989 model year. Sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> built pickup trucks should increase slightly, he said. When asked if a larger car would be made at the <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> plant, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said only that it would be two to three model years away. However, he later said a redesigned Stanza would be offered at about the same time, and with design work done in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, `` at that time it could be an all-American vehicle.'' He predicted the newly redesigned 1990 Stanza would more than double <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales for the nameplate during the 1990 model year. He also forecast that sales of the 300ZX sports car would rise in 1990, with sales of other cars flat or lower.

 Striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilots and Machinists unions said Monday they filed a civil racketeering lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, company chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and two subsidiary airlines. The lawsuit seeks relief for damages to employees and shareholders from a pattern of `` fraudulent empire-building, misrepresentation, extortion, asset-stripping and criminal activity against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> unions,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said. A spokesman for the clerk's office at the federal court in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> was unable to confirm receipt of the documents on Monday afternoon, but <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON> confirmed that he had filed the papers. The action, a counterclaim to an earlier lawsuit filed by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, charges violations of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act by the company. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said many of the allegations have been made to the bankruptcy court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but the racketeering complaint was filed because the progress of the bankruptcy case has been slow. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattell </PERSON> said the lawsuit was without merit. In a separate action Monday, a federal bankruptcy judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> granted an injunction to Eastern blocking another union lawsuit from being tried in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> district court. That suit, filed by <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> alone on Sept. 1, challenges <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s recent practice of leasing DC-9 jets and flight crews from sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. In a hearing before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> contended that Eastern violated its collective bargaining agreement with the pilots union by leasing the planes and crews from Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Zirinsky </PERSON>, a lawyer for Eastern, insisted that the leasing arrangement did n't violate any labor agreements and was vital to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s rebuilding effort. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> agreed, saying that the loss of the leasing arrangement _ now involving 16 jets and crews _ could cause `` irreparable harm'' to Eastern. In the corruption countersuit, the unions alleged a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of the securities laws, mail and wire fraud statutes and other federal laws. In addition to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, the lawsuit names subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The lawsuit seeks multimillion-dollar damages and relief to be determined by the court. The civil RICO statute allows juries to award triple damages. Because Eastern is in bankruptcy proceedings in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the unions said they will ask for a release from the bankruptcy court to press the claims against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> filed a civil RICO lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> in May 1988 accusing Eastern unions of trying to wreck the airline in order to force its sale at a loss. Eastern's Machinists, pilots and flight attendants walked off the job last March 4 and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors five days later.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy's manufacturing sector remained weak in September, although orders for exports increased sharply in spite of a stronger dollar, the nation's corporate purchasing managers said Monday. The Purchasing Managers' Index, a widely watched barometer of the economy's direction, rose to 46 percent from 45.2 percent in August and matched the rate for July. A reading below 50 percent indicates the manufacturing sector of the economy is in decline while a reading above 50 percent indicates growth, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. Survey responses indicated new export orders rose during the month while prices continued falling, and production, employment, new orders and inventories all declined. The mixed picture painted by the managers left economists divided in their opinions of where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing is headed in coming months. `` This is a report that is filled with cross currents. It does n't have a black and white picture that the economy is doing great,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, economist with <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The monthly report is based on a survey of purchasing executives in more than 250 industrial companies. The index is a composite of five separate indicators, including new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment. The September overall index represented only a slight upturn from the August reading, which had been the lowest for the index since December 1982, although the overall index averaged 49.5 percent for the first three quarters of 1989. `` Past experience indicates that if this average were to continue for the final quarter, it would be consistent with real GNP growth of about 1.7 percent for all of 1989,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bretz </PERSON>, survey chairman. But <PERSON> Bretz </PERSON> also said the index would have to fall below 44 percent to show economic contraction for the year. A sharp increase in export orders came despite the strength in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar during September. Some 60.5 percent of those surveyed reported their volume of new export orders rose during the month, compared with 56 percent in August. It was the highest level since April when the New Export Order index was 62 percent. The seasonally adjusted indexes for the five separate indicators represent the net change between those reporting positive, negative and similar responses from the previous month. The report also indicated inflation eased for the fourth consecutive month in September, with the index remaining at 43.1 percent. Ten percent of those surveyed reported higher prices, compared with 13 percent in August, and 25 percent reported lower prices, compared with 30 percent in August. The production index rose to 48.5 percent from 46.5 percent in August while the employment index rose to 45.9 percent from 44.7 percent. The index for new orders moved up to 45.4 percent from 45.1 percent in the previous month. And the inventories index rose to 45.1 percent from 43.3 percent in August. `` Manufacturing related to exports, particularly capital goods and capital goods spending and equipment were strong, while the automobile sector and related areas remained soft,'' <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said. `` The report is reflecting this mixture of pluses and minuses.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Solloway </PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said that given the likely decline in car sales and corporate profitability as well as other sectors, `` the report would seem to point to a deepening weakness into October and probably into the end of the year.'' A slowdown in home construction would affect demand for lumber and other building-related materials and equipment, <PERSON> Solloway </PERSON> said. `` I still would n't rule out recession starting toward the end of the year,'' <PERSON> Solloway </PERSON> said. `` It's a minority view but one that can still be argued.'' Some economists said the data showed a more positive outlook. `` The manufacturing sector seems to be coming back a little,'' said <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>. `` It is consistent with continuing strong growth in exports and equipment spending.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose in quiet trading Monday, resisting continued intervention by central banks to weaken the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. Gold prices were mixed. `` Trading was dominated by profit-taking with central bank intervention less effective,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>, currency broker with <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and foreign central banks continued for the second consecutive week to sell dollars in a concerted effort to push the dollar lower. Last week the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency lost more than 4 percent of its value against the West German mark and Japanese yen. The action has followed a recent agreement by the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized democracies that the dollar's recent rise was `` inconsistent with longer run economic fundamentals.'' The seven nations in the group are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Currency analysts said many traders remained bullish and repeatedly challenged the intervention. `` The underlying pro-dollar sentiment was coming back out of the closet, and every time it came out the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> came in and intervened along with other central banks,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar ended slightly lower at 139.30 Japanese yen compared with 139.35 at Friday's close.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Touch 16-Year Low On Ivory Coast Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Cocoa futures prices plunged to a 16-year low Monday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on indications that more cocoa from the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> may be headed for an already overburdened world market. On other commodity markets Monday, cotton futures rallied strongly, grains and soybeans were sharply higher, most energy futures fell, livestock and meat futures were mixed, and precious metals were mixed. Cocoa settled $ 25 to $ 34 lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 1,008 per metric ton. The December contract traded as low as $ 995 during the session, marking cocoa's first dip below $ 1,000 since 1973. The close was also the lowest since 1973. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds. Analysts attributed much of the market's weakness to confirmation that the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, the world's largest cocoa producer, had slashed by 50 percent the support price it pays to cocoa farmers. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the price-support cut had been urged by international lending agencies and could signal a more aggressive selling posture on the part of the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, rumors resurfaced that a 500,000-ton Ivorian cocoa deal involving two trade houses had collapsed. `` It just means there is that much more cocoa to be sold,'' <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> said. Cotton futures soared on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Cotton Exchange, largely reflecting bullish chart signals. Further buying was linked to speculation that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s cotton crop may be smaller than forecast and to position-evening by traders in a market that has fluctuated wildly in recent weeks. `` A lot of people have been whipsawed by this market,'' said analyst <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganes </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Corn futures prices soared on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid rumblings of a major Soviet purchase of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, and the other grain and soybean markets went along for the ride. Rumors that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had bought as much as 3 million metric tons of corn over the weekend sent futures prices for corn up the permitted daily limit of 10 cents a bushel shortly after the opening. The other markets rose in sympathy with corn, but prices retreated from their highs across the board in afternooon profit-taking. Wheat futures settled unchanged to 4 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 4.07 \ a bushel; corn was 6 cents to 8 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.41 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 2 -RCB- cents to 4 \ cents higher with December at $ 1.46 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 4 -LCB- cents to 9 cents higher with November at $ 5.77 a Energy futures finished mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, led by a drop in near-term heating oil contracts that was viewed as a technical correction following five days of steady gains.

 Oil futures prices fell Monday as a recent rally inspired by a new <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production agreement ran out of steam. The November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, slipped 12 cents to close at $ 20.01 per 42-gallon barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The contract had gained 27 cents on Friday. Friday's advance was sparked by an agreement among the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> that raised the ceiling on the cartel's overall output to 20.5 million barrels of oil a day from the previous limit of 19.5 million barrels. Oil investors were encouraged by the group's ability to reach an agreement to limit production. On Monday, though, many traders sold futures contracts to cash in their profits and halted the rally, analysts said. `` There was a feeling the market was overbought'' on Friday, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON>, a vice president of energy futures trading at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>AMR Plane-Buying Spree Continues With $850 Million Airbus Deal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced another airplane purchase Monday, a deal for six <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> jets and options for six more, giving the parent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> firm orders for 248 jets with options for 302 more as it continues to expand what is already the largest fleet in the non-Communist world. Neither company would reveal the cost of the deal, but previous estimates have placed it above $ 850 million. The deal means that in the last 31 months, the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth-based </LOCATION> company has placed firm orders and options for more than $ 22 billion worth of planes for American, which last year became the nation's largest carrier. In addition, its <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> commuter airline has placed orders and options for another 250 jets valued at about $ 1.45 billion. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> continued to be one of the most actively traded issues on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Monday as 1.6 million shares changed hands and the price declined $ 1.12 -LCB- a share to close at $ 85. The activity has been attributed to speculation involving a possible takeover of the airline. <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> said it would use the six widebody A300-600Rs ordered Monday to expand its <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> service, and return to domestic service some of the DC-10s now flying those routes. Five of the jets, valued at about $ 71 million each, will be delivered in 1991, with one the following year. <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> also has options for six more of the jets to be delivered in 1992 and 1993. The jets are powered by two <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> CF6-80C2 engines. The planes, which meet the strictest noise requirements, are designed to carry about 267 passengers, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Venz </PERSON>, spokesman for the French manufacturer. `` The point is that we are a growing and expanding airline company with a great need for airplanes,'' <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said. `` We are always looking for aircraft. Most of the planes purchased during the buying binge have been intended for expansion and not replacement of older aircraft, <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said. American's fleet already numbers 485, and <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said the carrier plans to have 575 planes by 1994. That does not count the options the airline holds for an additional 302 jets. `` Admittedly it's blue sky,'' <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said, but <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> is in position to have a 900-plane fleet by the end of the next decade. With Monday's order, American now has firm orders for 85 MD-80s and eight MD-11s from <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; 70 757-200s and 10 767-399ERs from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; and 75 <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> 100s from the Dutch manufacture. The airline also has options on 100 MD-80 and 42 MD-11s, 85 options split between the two <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> aircraft and 75 options on the <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> 100s.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday a plan to reduce its 105,000-employee workforce by some 2,500 people through a program emphasizing what the electronics company called `` enhanced voluntary severance.'' `` This is aimed primarily at salaried employees,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Sengstock </PERSON>. `` We've improved our normal voluntary severance package. Those applying who are accepted will now receive two weeks' severance pay for each year of service.'' The program, which is restricted primarily to <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations, goes into effect immediately, <PERSON> Sengstock </PERSON> said. He said most of those being urged to take the severance package work in the company's communications and semiconductor products groups. `` If we do not have enough people volunteering for severance, some involuntary severances may occur, but we wo n't know about that for at least six weeks,'' said <PERSON> Sengstock </PERSON>. `` We're hoping we can meet our goals through voluntary severance, normal attrition and internal business transfers.'' The company said a pretax provision of approximately $ 43 million to cover the cost of the severance would be reflected in third-quarter earnings to be announced next week. `` We retain our confidence in the company's growth prospects,'' said company president <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. `` This program simply reflects what we at <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> consider to be good and prudent management and provides a means for us to reduce our cost base through a voluntary process which is in the best interest of our employees.'' The package will be offered to workers at selected <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> facilities until approximately mid-November, <PERSON> Sengstock </PERSON> said. He mentioned plants in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Boynton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, as among the facilities where salaried employees would be encouraged to take severance. <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in this <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb, has plants or other facilities at some 24 locations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sengstock </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, expressing concern about the economy, announced Monday it was diverting $ 370 million from its earnings to increase its reserve for possible loan losses. <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepanian </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said based on current estimates, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> will have a third-quarter loss of approximately $ 125 million after placing the money in its reserve for credit losses. But he said <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> should end the first nine months of 1989 with a profit. `` It's a good deal of money,'' said bank spokesman <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. `` It's certainly a big hit for us.'' In a separate matter, <PERSON> Stepanian </PERSON> said the bank has taken steps to strengthen its internal controls, real estate lending and review of credit risk, as suggested by federal regulators after a review by the office of the Comptroller of the Currency. `` The issues raised by the regulators are ones we take very seriously,'' <PERSON> Stepanian </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. On the new reserve, <PERSON> Stepanian </PERSON> said the bank was taking a leadership position similar to 1987, when it shifted money to cover loans to Third World countries. Among the reasons he cited for Monday's action were continued weakness in the real estate industry and `` further signs of softness in general economic conditions.'' The bank already had 100 percent reserves against its non-trade-related lending to Third World countries. Also, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said, one of the bank's business customers assumed a large amount of debt for a transaction, and now the bank is concerned that the company might have trouble paying off the loan. He declined to name the company or the amount of the loan. By shifting money into the reserve account, `` it does n't just forgive the debt,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` We're taking it off the books so it does n't just hang there,'' he said, adding that the bank would still try to recover the money. The additional reserve, combined with $ 70 million in charge-offs for bad loans in the quarter, brings the total reserve to about $ 945 million, or 3.5 percent of total loans and leases. <PERSON> Stepanian </PERSON> said the bank expects to enter an agreement with the federal agency in which the board of directors will review steps to improve its performance in those areas cited in the governmental review.

 <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, using $ 49 one-way flights to lure passengers, on Monday resumed about 20 percent of its 256-flight network virtually shut down when the carrier filed its second bankruptcy reorganization in seven years. Meanwhile, the list of creditors against the cash-squeezed airline continued to grow as laid-off union workers prepared petitions for back wages and benefits. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>, which has lost nearly $ 1.6 million a week this year, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Thursday and announced plans to cut its work force to about 2,000 from 4,791. Officials at the Orlando-based carrier say they plan to reorganize as a smaller airline. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> operated four flights linking its <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, hub with <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. Eight flights were run daily on the weekend using 160-seat <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 aircraft, and 46 flights were scheduled for Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the most crowded weekend flight was Sunday from Los Angles to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, with about 73 percent of the seats filled. On Saturday, only 13 percent of seats were occupied on a flight from <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. From <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> on Monday scheduled flights to and from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. From <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, round-trip flights were scheduled to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guardia </LOCATION>. Before the bankruptcy filing, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> flew to 39 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities and <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the carrier will not likely consider boosting service until mid October. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 49 one-way fare ends Wednesday, but $ 99 fares will be in effect until Oct. 31. Teamster officials Monday held meetings in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> for the more than 1,800 laid-off <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> union workers, said <LOCATION> Teamster </LOCATION> business representative <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Belans </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> employed about 2,250 Teamster members, mostly customer service agents, clerical workers and other support personnel. <PERSON> Belans </PERSON> said the meetings were called to instruct workers on how to petition the bankruptcy court for back pay and benefits. The airline withheld final paychecks to many laid-off workers. The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents 900 <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> employees, plans to establish some type of relief effort for laid-off members who need food, clothing and other assistance, said union spokeswoman <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinsey </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. `` We have the work force now to support the flights and I ca n't speculate when we may need more,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> He said the company has set up a toll-free telephone number to assist laid-off employees find job-training programs and other resources. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>, acquired last year in a leveraged buyout by a group of investors led by <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, lost $ 31.8 million on revenue of $ 293 million from February to July. The carrier's net worth _ assets minus debts _ declined from $ 33.6 million on Jan. 31, 1988, to a negative $ 23 million July 31. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy in 1982, shortly after industry deregulation, and emerged in 1984 as a smaller carrier. It relocated its headquarters from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> in May. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> hopes to settle the $ 1.5 billion in claims from the first bankruptcy filing by the end of the year. A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 20 before Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 2 billion agreement to acquire 50 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> A320 jets, <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the world's largest supercomputer manufacturers, announced Monday it is laying off 400 employees at two <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> plants. The layoffs are due to a failure to meet sales projections and the fact that fewer employees are needed to manufacture today's supercomputer systems, the Minneapolis-based company said <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> said it has essentially completed the transition from the Cray X-MP system to the more advanced <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> Y-MP product line. <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> has about 5,400 employees worldwide. `` We never have had a major layoff in our 17-year history, largely because growth in market demand has more than made up for efficiencies realized in the manufacturing process,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollwagen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. `` Today, however, our rate of growth has slowed, and the technical advances move as fast, if not faster, than before,'' he said. The company said all costs associated with the manufacturing work force reduction would be incurred in 1989, and are expected to total about $ 3 million. <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> said it was eliminating 280 jobs at <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> and 120 at its <LOCATION> Rice </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> plant. The company offered full salary to the end of year for any employees who left voluntarily at the end of the month. Any layoffs will be based on seniority, <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> said. Workers who lose their jobs would also get $ 4,000 in education grants, the company said.

<HEAD>Lockheed To Take $165 Million in Charges Against 3rd-Quarter Profits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALABASAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it would take a charge of about $ 165 million against its third-quarter profits because of overruns on fixed-price contracts. The writeoffs will result in an after-tax loss of about $ 35 million for the three months ended Sept. 31, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tellep </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. The charges stem mainly from a subcontract for wing parts on the C-17 transport that <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is building for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and a contract to modify 12 EP-3E patrol planes for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. Also included in the charge are overruns on some smaller fixed-price development contracts and certain other programs, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s initial cost figure was $ 1.3 billion for the C-17 wing work, and $ 59.8 million for the EP-3E modifications. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Slayman </PERSON> said the company is continuing efforts to persuade the government that <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> should be paid more because hundreds of changes were made in design specifications after the contracts were made. `` The assumption was these were build to -LRB- blue -RRB- print,'' he said. `` But then there were many changes made in those prints.'' Despite the expected third-quarter loss, <PERSON> Slayman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> expected the year to be profitable as a whole.

<HEAD>Coal Strike Blamed for Profit Decline at CSX</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s third-quarter profit declined, due in part to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the Richmond-based railroad, barge and natural resources company said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> said third-quarter earnings totaled $ 94 million, or 91 cents per share, compared with $ 120 million, or 75 cents a share, for the same period last year. Revenue for the quarter totaled $ 1.9 billion, $ 1 million less than last year's third quarter. The disparity in the per-share earnings between the two quarters reflects an ongoing share-repurchase program. In addition to lower coal traffic caused by the ongoing coal strike, which began April 5, <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> cited an overall weakening of the economy's industrial sector as well as service disruptions and damage caused by Hurricane Hugo for its lower earnings. The company said earnings for the first nine months of 1989 totaled $ 327 million, or $ 3.10 per share, compared with earnings of $ 25 million, or 11 cents a share, for the first nine months of 1988. Last year's results reflected a post-tax special charge of $ 492 million, or $ 3.16 per share. Revenue for the first nine months was $ 5.7 billion, compared with $ 5.5 billion for the same 1988 period.

<HEAD>Belzbergs Seek Special Stockholders Meeting In Armstrong Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANCASTER, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Canadian family considering a hostile takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has asked the board of directors to allow a special stockholders meeting. Lancaster-based <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures interior furnishings, said in a news release Monday it is examining the request from the <PERSON> Belzberg </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, which has interests in real estate and a financial company. The family's petition asks the board to amend its articles of incorporation to allow investors holding 20 percent of the company's stock to call a special meeting. According to the petition, two companies controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Belzbergs </ORGANIZATION> own 4.56 million shares, or 9.85 percent of the company. The shares were purchased for $ 181 million this summer. The petition, which was filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, indicates the <ORGANIZATION> Belzbergs </ORGANIZATION> have not acquired any more <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> stock since announcing their initial stake July 5.

The Belzbergs asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to approve the petition's requests.
