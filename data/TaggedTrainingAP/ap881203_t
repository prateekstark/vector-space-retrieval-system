<HEAD>France Lifts Embargo on Iranian Crude Oil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has lifted its 15-month embargo on imports of crude oil from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, once its largest oil supplier. The Industry Ministry informed oil companies operating in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Friday that imports of Iranian crude are henceforth subject to the usual French regulations governing oil imports. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> severed its diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> following the `` Embassy War'' in the summer of 1987 when the <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> refused to allow <PERSON> Wahid </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordji </PERSON>, an interpreter without diplomatic status, to be interrogated by a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> judge in connection with terrorist attacks in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in September 1986. The French police blocked off the embassy and the Iranians retaliated by preventing French diplomats in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> from leaving their embassy. <PERSON> Gordji </PERSON> and the French consul in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> were eventually exchanged in November 1987. The embargo was partially lifted Sept. 9 when <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> resumed normal diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Oil industry officials said the partial lifting of the embargo did not have any practical effect because it simply involved giving authorization to French oil companies on a case-by-case basis to do barter deals involving Iranian crude. The barter deals were negotiated by French trading houses and involved exchanges of French food and farm products, notably sugar and meat, for Iranian crude. Industry sources said none of the barter deals was ever concluded, however, because the Iranian asking price was felt to be too high in view of the bearishness of the oil market at the time. Latest oil industry statistics show no imports of Iranian crude by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in the first nine months of this year. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> imported 4.4 million tons of Iranian crude during the first eight months of 1987. Imports totalled 2.9 million tons in 1986. <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Breuil-Jarrige </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> association </ORGANIZATION>, wrote to Industry Minister <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauroux </PERSON> in June after diplomatic relations were restored to point out that the embargo was having no real effect. He argued that French refiners were importing petroleum products made from Iranian crude imported by other European refiners. French oil companies also pointed out at the time that they had a competitive disadvantage compared with European counterparts because <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was selling its crude relatively cheaply.

 The General Assembly slapped its host country with an unprecedented rebuke by voting 154-2 to reconvene in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> so <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, barred from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, can address the delegates. The resolution adopted Friday `` deplores'' the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' refusal to grant <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa `` Once again, within hours, the international body in this community has stood together for what is right against what is wrong,'' said <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Zuhdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Labib </PERSON> <PERSON> Terzi </PERSON>. Only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> voted against the Arab-sponsored resolution. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> abstained, having previously said the criticism in the resolution was too harsh. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, `` who specialized in hijacking of airplanes and cruise ships, are expanding their efforts and hijacking the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s acting ambassador, <PERSON> Johanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bein </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON>, the acting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative, said the move was unnecessary. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> contended that another <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegate could present <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s viewpoints. But the highest ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> sided with critics, saying <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s action had done `` incalculable damage to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> credibility in the world arena.'' The comments were written by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, undersecretary-general for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> affairs, in a letter to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The assembly took the historic step of moving to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s European headquarters because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rejected <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> appeals to admit <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, who last visited <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1974 <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did n't object to the move and would participate in debate there. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> wants to address the 159-nation assembly to explain the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s declaration of an independent state and its implicit recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The Palestinian issue will be discussed Dec. 13-15 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. It will be the first session the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has convened outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> since moving into its building in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> in 1952. <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was justified in denying a visa to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, whom the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration called an `` accessory to terrorism.'' Critics said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action violated the 1947 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Headquarters Agreement, under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is obligated to grant visas to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomats and guests. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has estimated the cost of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> session at $ 645,500, including $ 159,000 for first-class round-trip tickets to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for delegates of the world's 40 poorest countries. Since 1946, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has paid travel expenses of the least developed nations so they can be represented in deliberations. The cost also includes travel for at least 30 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials and staff, translation and documentation in six official languages and other expenses. On Wednesday, the assembly overwhelmingly denounced the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> denial of a visa to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and gave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 24 hours to reconsider. Again, only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> voted against the resolution. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> abstained. On Thursday night, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government said it would not change its position. The resolution to move to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> was introduced early Friday. In his letter to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, written after the Wednesday vote, <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> position `` is baffling and contradictory because Chairman <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has already addressed the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, in 1974, and thus set a precedent for being granted an entry visa.'' <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION> was not present for Friday's vote, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has not had voting rights since 1974 because of its policy of apartheid.

 A retired <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> official faces a maximum 36-year prison term when he's sentenced Feb. 3 for receiving $ 24,185 in bribes to provide inside information to two businessmen who were found guilty of conspiracy. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Finotti </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 56, a former manager in <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION>'s transportation audit branch, was convicted by a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury of receiving the money and the use of a luxury automobile during an 18-month period ending in September 1986 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, 59, and <PERSON> Carmine </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> DePietro </PERSON>, 53, the former president and former executive vice president, respectively, of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, were convicted of conspiracy to defraud the government. The charge carries a five-year term. The three defendants were allowed to remain free on bond until their sentencing Feb. 3 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>. The scheme involved an effort to obtain inside information from <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> to help the <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, company, which purchased bills-of-lading at a discount from moving companies that hauled furniture of government employees. Under the arrangement known as factoring, the moving companies in effect paid <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> a premium to receive their money faster than if they waited for the government to pay them directly. Southern Investment, in turn, assumed total liability for any claims for damaged freight that the government filed against the trucking companies. The prosecution presented evidence that <PERSON> Finotti </PERSON> provided information about the reliability of freight haulers that enabled White and <PERSON> DePietro </PERSON> to decide whether to factor a company's bills-of-lading Such information would enable <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> to avoid purchasing moving bills from companies that would likely incur large damage claims, the prosecution contended. The indictment charged that <PERSON> Finotti </PERSON> manipulated the payment of bills-of-lading to benefit Southern Investment. Finotti, of <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, was convicted of conspiracy, bribery, conflict-of-interest, and filing a false government financial disclosure statement that did not report his financial arrangement with <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>More Than 200 Soviet Jews, Armenians Denied Admission As Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities have refused to grant refugee status to more than 200 Soviet Jews and Armenians, but a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official says they could be eligible to enter this country through a system known as parole. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Friday that the would-be refugees were unable to demonstrate `` a well-founded fear of persecution.'' But one way or another, he said, `` we continue to admit all Soviet Jewish applicants who choose to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The issue was raised by the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews. The private group released two petitions from Soviet Jews in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> awaiting entrance visas to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Most Jews who are permitted to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have exit permits to emigrate to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But an overwhelming majority choose to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after they reach <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said of more than 4,000 applications in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in October and November, less than 200 were found not to qualify for refugees status. But, he said, `` if this occurs, the applicants are, without exception, given the opportunity to apply for parole.'' To be granted parole, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, applicants must show they would be supported by a relative or a sponsor in the event jobs were not found. The idea is to avoid additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> welfare costs. Entering as a refugee provides certain benefits that are not available under parole. These include transportation expenses, some support for resettlement and access to Medicaid. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, he said, 99 applicants, most of whom were Armenians, did not qualify for refugee status during the two months. But, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, they also may seek admission under the parole system. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said there was no change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to call for freedom of emigration for all and continues to admit all Soviet Jewish applicants who choose to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Most qualify as refugees, and in addition some enter as parolees.''

 Fire raced through the attic of a downtown motel late Friday night, leaving guests homeless, causing minor injuries to three people and gutting the top floor of the two-story building, officials said. The fire was reported at 11:30 p.m., Fire Chief <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said he did n't know how many guests were evacuated from the Village Inn Motel, but said the fire gutted at least 26 rooms. A woman who jumped from a second-story balcony was treated for a minor ankle injury and smoke inhalation, and two people were treated for smoke inhalation, said a paramedic who refused to give his name. A number of people lost belongings to the blaze, <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said. The fire began in a corner of the U-shaped motel, and moved through the attic around the building. All the rooms on the top floor suffered heavy fire damage, and most of the room beneath sustained water and smoke damage, officials said. About 60 <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> firefighters responded to the blaze, which sent smoke over several blocks of the city's old <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> neighborhood. Residents of a nearby apartment complex were evacuated as a precaution because of the smoke, <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Some 200 U.S., Soviet Satellites Spying on Earth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The new military spy satellite carried into space is viewed by some experts as capable of gathering such important information that it is only a matter of time before the Soviets begin to think of ways of destroying it in the event of war. Like the roughly 200 military satellites already deployed in space by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the $ 500 million Lacrosse satellite reportedly aboard the space shuttle Atlantis is not armed. It is a surveillance satellite, carrying a sophisticated radar that can look down from space, piercing even cloud cover to reveal what's happening on the ground. `` As military satellites become more directly applicable to actual combat, they become much more attractive targets for destruction,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, an expert on space systems with the Federation of American Scientists here. `` Lacrosse provides a good example of that,'' he said. `` It's going up there to find targets for the new stealth bomber and to look for long-range targets deep behind the lines in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact Now, if I've got all that riding on my satellites, the Soviets would be crazy not to try to shoot them down.'' `` Space is already militarized,'' agreed <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON>, an authority on nuclear weaponry with the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal think tank in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The question is whether we're going to avoid the weaponization of space. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now has approximately 75 to 80 military satellites in space, while roughly 125 of the 150-plus Russian satellites now in orbit are thought to have some military use. The numbers are approximate, because neither government talks about the matter. The Pentagon, for example, considers the Atlantis launch a classified military mission for which no information will be provided. It will neither confirm nor deny that the cargo is a radar-imaging satellite. As approximate as the tallies are, they demonstrate the growing reliance of the two superpowers on military space systems. It was only three decades ago _ in 1957 with <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>'s Sputnik _ that mankind developed the ability to put a manmade object into orbit. Now, military satellites are in orbit spying on facilities and forces, scanning the radio waves as electronic ferrets, watching for nuclear explosions or missile launches and mapping the Earth's surface Even the seemingly mundane tasks in space have become important for war-fighting. Communications is an obvious example, but there are others. For example, the latest generation of navigation satellites help provide the pinpoint accuracy now claimed for nuclear missiles like the giant MX. Among other functions, these satellites allow the military to synchronize its watches down to billionths of a second. And scrutinizing the weather becomes essential in the event of a war. Both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are operating advanced meteorological satellites to aid low-level bombers, detect solar flares and find holes in cloud cover for reconnaissance work. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now has 20 military satellites of various types waiting to go into orbit _ victims of the launch hiatus forced by the Challenger disaster and unrelated problems with unmanned Titan boosters. As that backlog is slowly erased, <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> and others suggest the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> _ and perhaps the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> _ will face other problems with their satellite hardware besides protecting them as tempting targets. `` The expense of these new types of satellites is not to be believed,'' says <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON>. `` We're going to have to look at a single satellite the way we look at an aircraft carrier. These satellites alone are costing $ 250 million and up.'' Such complaints do n't bother <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials, because they see no alternative. As outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> `` Pete'' <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> observed recently: `` We must put a large part of our investment ... into the satellites which meet mission needs today and tomorrow. Simply stated, we must be able to conduct operations in space, at all times, in any environment _ peace or war.''

He signed autographs for Israeli reporters and agreed to be photographed with a Hebrew-language magazine in his hands. The hijackers were flown to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after seizing a bus with 30 children in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and trading it for a plane, crew and $ 3.3 million ransom. `` They were playing cards,'' during the flight, <PERSON> Yermilov </PERSON> said. `` At some point, some of them were in the cockpit behind us, and they were watching us. They had guns, but they were not waving them around and threatening us.'' A younger crew member, who did not give his name, added: `` They were counting the money.'' <PERSON> Yermilov </PERSON>, who wore a dark blue <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> uniform, said the hijackers appeared to be in their 30s. He said they never said why they chose <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as their destination. `` They were people who wanted to fly out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. That's why they kidnapped the bus with children,'' <PERSON> Yermilov </PERSON> said. `` They asked for a lift for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and we gave them a lift,'' he added jokingly. He said the crew was appointed for the mission by Soviet authorities. `` We are international pilots. We understood that we have a mission that has to be done,'' <PERSON> Yermilov </PERSON> said, adding that the crew was aware of the danger. `` We were told that our guarantees are zero. But they -LRB- the hijackers -RRB- seemed quite good-natured,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A judge who suggested a child molester was driven to his crimes by his wife's pregnancy has resigned, the lord chancellor said, but he offered to quit before he made his controversial comments. The announcement Friday said that Judge Sir <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassel </PERSON> submitted his resignation Monday and cited health reasons. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Cassel </PERSON> set off a furor by giving two years probation to a 30-year-old man who admitted three indecent assaults on his adolescent stepdaughter. `` It is regrettable that a judge should have expressed himself in a way that suggested that there are any circumstances that can excuse or condone indecent assault on children,'' said <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON>, who as lord chancellor is chief of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s judicial system. <PERSON> Cassel </PERSON>, 72, became a judge 12 years ago. The defendant admitted twice molesting the girl when she was 12 and a third time when the girl was 13 and the mother was in the last month of pregnancy. The mother's condition, <PERSON> Cassel </PERSON> said, led to a `` lack of sexual appetite in the lady and considerable problems for a healthy young husband.'' The judge traced the abuse to the mother's efforts to overcome the girl's resentment of the new man in the house. `` The stepmother encouraged the girl to cuddle her husband and even got into the habit of inviting her into the marital bed,'' the judge said. `` This was not an invitation to a toddler, but to a girl approaching puberty, and the cuddles began to go too far.'' The mother has filed for divorce. More than 20 members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, including lawmakers from all major parties, called for <PERSON> Cassel </PERSON>'s resignation.

<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his staff are defending the way the transition office has handled appointments in a week that produced only one announcement. All week, there was speculation that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would make announcements on more Cabinet members, particularly for the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> and other national security jobs. But the only statement was that <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> would stay on as White House spokesman. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who met Friday with foreign leaders and former presidential rivals, including <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, seemed to bristle when reporters asked him if his appointment process was stalled. `` There's no holdup. We're way ahead of schedule,'' he said, complaining about `` early, premature, needless speculation.'' <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, co-director of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition office, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his aides spent part of the past week talking to experts in defense and national security about running the mammoth agency. `` The whole point of this week has been designed to try to explore how best to manage the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, what kind of challenges await the next secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> remains a contender for the job, and the vice president has `` tremendous confidence'' in his old friend. Though <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said nothing to dispel reports that Tower is the leading candidate for defense secretary, he added, `` There may be others, there may be other approaches.'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is taking an overview of his Cabinet vacancies because he wants to make sure women and minorities claim some of the top jobs. To date, only white males have been named to the positions, although <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, a Hispanic, has been asked to stay on as education secretary. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said it could be a couple of weeks before the Cabinet is in place, but appointments will be made as they are decided upon. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has decided to remove from Cabinet rank the job of ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and not to restore to Cabinet level the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The paper quoted transition officials as saying the decision reflects his belief that the two posts _ both of which he has previously held _ should be less visible in internal policy-making debates. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met for 35 minutes Friday, and the two avoided the negative rhetoric that characterized the presidential campaign. `` I expressed my concern obviously about the deficit,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate, said. He also stressed issues that were important to Democrats _ better health care, housing, education and the environment. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said afterward: `` I want to express my appreciation to Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for coming our way. We had good discussion of the issues that are facing the country in a spirit of good will.'' The vice president also saw <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who tried unsuccessfully to gain the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he talked with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a country the television evangelist recently visited. `` The time has come to recognize the South African government needs a little encouragement,'' said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, an opponent of sanctions and disinvestment as a strategy for forcing change in the white-ruled country. Late in the day <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met at his residence with Argentine President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, who had flown in from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the get-acquainted session. Neither <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commented on reports from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> that troops had moved into position to quell an insurrection at a military base outside <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. The government said later it had put down the rebellion. Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> attended the meeting. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began his day seeing <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> Premier <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Swan </PERSON>, the fourth foreign leader he has met since he was elected. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> was the fifth, and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will be the sixth. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will join President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at a meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Dec. 7. So far, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s only scheduled event over the weekend is to attend a movie entitled `` My Stepmother is an Alien'' on Saturday night. The Bushes usually attend church on Sunday.

 Thirteen people filming a documentary were trapped more than 250 feet under the ground in a cave today after a sudden rainstorm caused the cave's mouth to collapse, police said. Police spokesman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodfield </PERSON> said the group was in no immediate danger and that rescue workers were trying to reach them. `` The rescue team has established a communications line inside the cave and they are all doing fine,'' said <PERSON> Goodfield </PERSON>. The nationalities of the film makers were not known. The group became trapped late Friday while filming in the extensive cave system under the isolated Nullarbor Plain in southwestern <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Goodfield </PERSON> said. The Nullarbor is a huge dry plain but there is an extensive cave system underneath it, containing subterranean water systems linking caves. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who left the Nullarbor group Sunday, said they were filming a documentary on the caves. He said all of those trapped were experienced cave divers but that the cave they were in was not underwater. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said the group radioed for help from their ground crew which in turn notified authorities. `` It was a freak hurricane,'' he said. `` You do n't get a lot of hurricanes on the Nullarbor. So much water washed down the entrance of the cave that it washed enough rubble down to cause a blockage about 100 feet down into the cave.'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said the group was safely beyond that depth in a large chamber about 260 feet below the surface. `` No one's injured, they've got communication with the surface and they've got a reasonable amount of water and food,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said.

 A metal rod probably intended to sabotage a passenger train instead knocked another train carrying <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s mayor off the tracks and sent it tumbling down a ravine, officials said The mayor's wife and the wife of <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION>'s mayor were killed in the crash, which occurred Thursday during an outing to the <LOCATION> Inca </LOCATION> ruins of Machu Picchu, high in the Andes. <PERSON> Jacinto </PERSON> <PERSON> Laguna </PERSON>, an employee of the state-owned railroad <ORGANIZATION> Enafer </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that railroad officials found a piece of metal wedged into the track. <PERSON> Laguna </PERSON> said the rod caused the railway car, a small bus modified to travel on tracks, to jump the track at a curve and plunge into the 200-foot deep ravine.

<HEAD>Ohio Announces Fernald Cleanup Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A historic agreement giving <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> the authority to regulate the federal cleanup of a uranium plant was panned by some neighbors, who plan to pursue their lawsuit against the nuclear weapons factory. Some <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON> residents complained that the agreement between the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> approved by a federal judge Friday fails to commit the agency to spending the $ 1 billion it estimates is needed for the cleanup. `` I do n't really see a commitment that cleanup will be done and I do n't see a timetable as to when it will be done,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Fernald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Residents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. Residents also pointed out that the pact provides no money for victims of alleged radioactive contamination from the plant, and that the state has agreed to give up any right to sue the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> or factory contractors. But officials said the consent decree approved here by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> is a historic document allowing <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to enforce state environmental regulatory power over the cleanup of the plant, which processes uranium for nuclear weapons assembled elsewhere. The agreement also requires the department to pay the state about $ 1 million in penalties and to reimburse <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> for overseeing the cleanup. The Energy Department has admitted that the plant emitted radioactive uranium dust into the atmosphere over three decades. The plant, known as the Feed Materials Production Center, sits on 1,050 acres 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> above the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> aquifer, a water source for 2 million people. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, operations, which include <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON>, said the agreement is evidence of intent to clean up the plant. He said it is not intended as an admission of wrongdoing. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, who announced the agreement with <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said he hoped the decree will prompt <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to give high priority to cleanups of 17 Energy Department plants nationwide, including <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON>. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates it will cost $ 175 billion to clean up the 17 sites over the next 35 years. Only $ 300 million is budgeted for the job next year, he said. <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> will pursue two federal lawsuits against the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The agreement grew out of two years of negotiations in those cases. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> lawyer for the plant's neighbors, said the settlement gives the state no authority over radioactive wastes stored at the plant. <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON> said the neighbors will proceed with their $ 300 million class-action suit at a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing Dec. 16 in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. `` We have every intention of going forward,'' he said. Plant neighbor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Clawson </PERSON>, who's represented in the class-action lawsuit, said the agreement falls short of what the Energy Department should do. `` It mainly addressed the hazardous-waste problem, not the radioactive waste problem,'' said <PERSON> Clawson </PERSON>, who lives four miles from the plant. `` They've hardly admitted to anything yet.'' <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said the decree is historic because it gives a state a court-enforceable order with which to pressure the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to clean up a nuclear facility `` The decree also extends <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s jurisdiction over <ORGANIZATION> Fernald </ORGANIZATION> to all state and federal hazardous-waste law and regulations,'' <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> said. Both men said it is the first such agreement they know of in the nation. The 37-year-old plant has supplied uranium to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Rocky Flats plant in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> reactors in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plant in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> nuclear complex. The <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors are shut down because of problems there, and the closure of the Rocky Flats plant is reportedly being considered. The Fernald plant has been halted by a strike that began Oct. 7. Energy Department officials have said they expect production to resume when the strike ends, but declined to comment on the plant's long-term status A department report is due out Dec. 15 on the status of aging nuclear weapons plants nationwide.

 Public nudity has been banned in <LOCATION> Goa </LOCATION>, whose white sandy beaches have long attracted tourists searching for the allover suntan, <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said today. Plainclothes policemen have been posted on the beaches of the former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> enclave, and patrol boats will keep watch to enforce the ban, <ORGANIZATION> PTI </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Nudism is not allowed and violators are liable to punishment,'' say billboards set up at all major beaches in the west coast resort. <ORGANIZATION> PTI </ORGANIZATION> did not say what the punishment would be. Tens of thousands of foreign and Indian tourists visit <LOCATION> Goa </LOCATION> every year. The ban was imposed because Indians, who usually travel in families, said they were embarrassed by the public display of nudity, <ORGANIZATION> PTI </ORGANIZATION> said. Goans who operate tourist resorts also complained that nude sunbathing was a bad influence on their children, the news agency said.

 Four people freed from a stalled elevator after spending the night said they kept their spirits up by playing cards and imagining worse predicaments. The four were freed Friday morning after more than 14 hours in the 4-foot-square elevator in this <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> city. `` We were trying to decide what would be worse than this,'' <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordgren </PERSON>, 34, said. `` So I asked everyone, Would you rather go into major surgery or go through this again? We all decided surgery.'' <PERSON> Nordgren </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehmann </PERSON>, 39; <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON> `` Kitty'' <PERSON> Reinhart </PERSON>, 59; and her husband, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>, 59, said they shared vitamin C tablets and a common toilet made from a plastic shopping bag neatly tied and tucked in a corner. <PERSON> Nordgren </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lehmann </PERSON> are beauticians at a third-floor beauty shop in the building. `` Normally, we never take the elevator when we leave,'' <PERSON> Nordgren </PERSON> said. But she and <PERSON> Lehmann </PERSON> decided to enter the elevator because the <ORGANIZATION> Reinharts </ORGANIZATION> were already in it and were holding the door for them, she said. The elevator became stuck shortly before 6 p.m. Thursday. `` I did n't think that I was going to get out of there alive,'' <PERSON> Lehmann </PERSON> said. She said she eventually overcame her panic and tore a metal plate from a telephone box inside the elevator. She then used it to pry open the elevator door, so fresh air could enter the elevator. The four were not discovered until shortly after 7 a.m., when the owner of a business in the building arrived.

<HEAD>Quadriplegic Woman Who Plays Keyboard With Mouth Challenging
Anti-begging Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A quadriplegic woman who says she makes $ 2,000 a week playing an electric organ with her mouth is challenging the city's anti-begging ordinance so she can continue her Boardwalk performances in front of casinos. <PERSON> Celestine </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing was postponed Friday, but her lawyers said they were confident they can reach an out-of-court agreement with the city. The 33-year-old woman solicits money from tourists by playing a portable electric keyboard with her tongue and lips. Birth defects left her arms and legs undeveloped, and family members move her on a gurney. Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said she averages $ 2,000 a week, enough to send her two daughters to private school. In the past several years, she has accumulated dozens of summonses from police enforcing this gambling resort's anti-begging ordinance. On Friday, she was in court to face 23 more. Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>'s attorneys presented a motion challenging the ordinance's constitutionality on grounds that it violates her right of self-expression. `` There is a constitutional right to express oneself artistically and musically,'' argued attorney <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Loughry </PERSON>. City Prosecutor <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Smoger </PERSON> said he had inadequate time to review the last-minute motion, and said it should be dismissed. Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weekes </PERSON> agreed to delay the hearing to give <PERSON> Smoger </PERSON> time to go over the motion and to give Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>'s attorneys time to continue negotiating with the city. `` I feel like my head is still on the chopping block, because what they decide will determine my future and my life,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said afterward. `` I believe that the Lord knows somebody's rights were violated, so he sent me here to prove it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said that even though the matter is unresolved, she will return to the Boardwalk today to perform. <PERSON> Smoger </PERSON> had been prepared to argue that Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> violated an agreement made with the city two years ago. After a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trial in 1986, a subsequent lawsuit and a lot of publicity, the city agreed to allow Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> to perform on the <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION>. The conditions were that she must stay near <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> and obtain a permit. <PERSON> Smoger </PERSON> said Friday that Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> had done neither. `` Apparently she became disgruntled because <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>'s -LRB- hotel-casino -RRB- was hiring outdoor bands and it cut into her gratuities, so she moved in front of fire doors at <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION>'s -LRB- Park Place Casino Hotel -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Smoger </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> acknowledged that she failed to buy insurance for a permit. Her attorney, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, said the city offered her standard one-day <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION> permits normally used for parades, which require a $ 1 million insurance bond. `` That's an unreasonable demand on someone who just plays the keyboard with her tongue,'' Ms. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. `` The rolling chairs on the Boardwalk are only required to carry a $ 300,000 policy, and they're carrying passengers.'' <PERSON> Smoger </PERSON> agreed with Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>'s lawyers that the 1986 agreement was vaguely worded. `` But even if this is resolved, we still have to settle the charges,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviet Official Says Internal Exile To Be Eliminated</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will eliminate the infamous practice of forced internal exile in a planned reform of the criminal code, according to a news report. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossia </ORGANIZATION> on Friday quoted Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Katargin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as saying, `` Exile is being ruled out as inexpedient.'' Internal exile as a form of punishment dates to the czars and has been used against criminals, revolutionaries, political prisoners, their relatives and, during the worst of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s purges, people deemed `` socially dangerous.'' Whole populations have been deported from their homes to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and the far north, including returning prisoners of war, farmers during the period of collectivization in the 1930s and residents of the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> republics and ethnic Germans during World War II. <PERSON> Katargin </PERSON> was quoted as saying exile will be eliminated as part of a revision of the entire criminal justice system. The changes will reduce prison sentences and substitute fines, suspended sentences and other lesser punishments for many offenses. Since 1980, the proportion of convicted criminals sentenced to imprisonment has dropped from 56 percent to 32 to 34 percent, <PERSON> Katargin </PERSON> was quoted as saying. After the new criminal code is passed, it is expected to drop to 22 percent to 24 percent, according to the report. It was not clear from <PERSON> Katargin </PERSON>'s statements to the newspaper whether the reform would end deportation from the country as well as internal exile. Nobel Prize-winning author <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> was stripped of his citizenship and deported in 1974, while human rights activist and nuclear scientist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was sentenced to internal exile. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was exiled from his home in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to the city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> in January 1980 for criticizing the Soviet intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He was released in December 1986 after receiving a telephone call from Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Exile has often been used as a secondary punishment following a term of imprisonment. Dissident <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON>, who was sent to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1986 as part of the deal that resulted in the Soviets' release of news correspondent <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniloff </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' release of suspected spy <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakharov </PERSON>, spent two years in the Arctic town of <LOCATION> Kobyai </LOCATION> after completing a term in a labor camp. Some internal exiles have been sent to a specific area, while others are simply banished from living in their hometowns or any of the six largest cities in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In the past, some were exiled to a specific isolated settlement to find on arrival that the only place to live is a labor camp and the only food is delivered to the camp mess hall. More typically, exiles could settle and find work. But for intellectuals, scientists and artists, banishment effectively ended their careers.

 Newsroom employees at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> have a tentative contract for the second time in 10 days, and union and management officials for the city's second-largest newspaper believe the new pact will win approval. `` Short of a strike, this is the best package we can bring to the membership,'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, chief negotiator for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, said after the agreement was announced Friday. `` I feel confident they'll accept it'' in a ratification vote Monday, <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said. The newspaper's chief negotiatior, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fantl </PERSON>, also praised the agreement. `` Both sides have worked hard and hopefully the -LRB- union's -RRB- members will accept it,'' he said. `` We were able to clear up some misunderstandings and reach an agreement.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> workers refused to consider a tentative settlement reached Nov. 22 after a dispute developed over pension conditions. Talks resumed Thursday, with a strike deadline set for noon Friday. Shortly after the deadline, the new agreement was announced. Reporters and others in the newsroom, many of whom had their coats in hand waiting to start a picket line, returned to their desks as word of the settlement spread, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehmann </PERSON>, a union spokesman and religion reporter. About 250 reporters, editorial and other newsroom workers belong to the guild and have been working without a contract since June 1. Friday's settlement calls for a $ 500 cash bonus Jan. 1 rather than July 1, and 3 percent wage increases in the second and third years of the contract. The night city editor's position will be exempt from the union. Pension benefits were increased by about 6 percent, <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said. The pay scale at the newspaper currently ranges from $ 625 a week for starting reporters to $ 895 for reporters with five years' experience The <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> has an estimated circulation of 605,000 daily and 614,000 on Sundays. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>'s circulation is estimated at 765,000 daily and 1.11 million on Sundays.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> is asking children nationwide to keep their gift lists and instead write <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> and his wife about their feelings this holiday season. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, a 39-year-old author of children's books and part-time teacher in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s capital, promises that <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Merry </PERSON> <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> will write back free of charge. `` I want the kids to describe their families, their preparations for Christmas, what they think the spirit of Christmas is, their hopes for world peace and, most importantly, to name somebody who's doing a good deed,'' <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> said recently Bloom's `` Heartlight Letterline'' is not his first holiday letter-writing program. Seven years ago, while living in the western <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> invented the characters `` Bubbie and <PERSON> Zadie </PERSON>'' as a Jewish alternative to Mr. and Mrs. <PERSON> Claus </PERSON>. He invited children to write <PERSON> Bubbie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zadie </PERSON> and share their feelings and joy about the holiday season. `` When I was a kid growing up in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, I felt left out of the -LRB- Christmas -RRB- season,'' recalled <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, who is of Jewish descent. `` That was my main impetus to begin Bubbie and <PERSON> Zadie </PERSON>. I thought maybe there could be something for Jewish kids to participate in.'' After news articles about <PERSON> Bubbie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zadie </PERSON> appeared across the nation, <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> received thousands of letters from children of all faiths. `` In Yiddish, <PERSON> Bubbie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zadie </PERSON> means <PERSON> Grandma </PERSON> and Grandpa, and basically they are everybody's <PERSON> Grandma </PERSON> and Grandpa,'' <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> said. `` They represent the love that grandparents have for grandchildren, and I think that's why it worked. I think if I had created Father Hanukkah or something, it would n't have been as endearing.'' <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> said he was motivated to keep the program going by the wonder and spirit of childhood reflected in the letters. `` I remember one of the first letters I got said, ` Dear Bubbie and <PERSON> Zadie </PERSON>: Do you happen to know my Bubbie and <PERSON> Zadie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>?' _ as if these grandparents in <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> know all grandparents. The children's world is an amazing world,'' he said. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> wrote a 1983 book about Bubbie and <PERSON> Zadie </PERSON>. Sales of the book, which includes an address, have kept dozens of letters coming to the mythical couple each year. Last fall, he decided to apply the same letter-writing idea to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> to open it up to more children and to counter the materialism that has become part of the season. `` There's a lot of these little mail-order things where for $ 5 you can have a Christmas letter sent from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> to your kid, but it's just a commercial thing and there's not much feeling to it,'' <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> said. `` As I see <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Merry </PERSON>, they are everybody's grandparents. It fits in, I think, with the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> myth.'' <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>'s wife figures prominently because `` spiritual things should be male and female whenever possible,'' <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> said. `` A little girl, for instance, might have something personal to tell <PERSON> Merry </PERSON>,'' he said. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> said his Jewish background should not disqualify him from perpetuating a symbol of a Christian holiday. `` Jewish-smewish. We're all related in this world and I, myself, believe in a philosophy of universalism. I'm deeply Jewish in my background and I'm proud of it. But I'm a universalist in that I do n't really believe in any one religion per se.'' <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> said he will answer all the letters and plans to recruit friends to help if necessary. `` I get enormous satisfaction in doing this.''

 A lawyer who helped end prison riots by Cuban detainees criticized the deportation of five men who fled <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in the 1980 Mariel boatlift as an unjustified normalization of relations with <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s government. A federal Marshal's Service airplane ferried five handcuffed Cuban prisoners, all convicted of crimes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> to an airfield near <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, on Friday. They were the first Cubans deported since a repatriation agreement with the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island nation ignited riots at federal prisons in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, last year. `` We hope to have many of these flights,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Vurstion-Wade </PERSON>. `` It's a tragic day for the aspirations of the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> people to a free <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> without <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Penalver </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> attorney who negotiated a settlement with Cuban detainees that ended the riots. `` This is normalization in criminal wrappings.'' When the men, accompanied by two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> guards, got off the plane in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, three of them `` knelt down and kissed the ground,'' Ms. <PERSON> Vurstion-Wade </PERSON> said. She said about 20 Cuban officials met them, exchanged documents with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, and took the five away on a bus. She said she did not know where the bus took them. The agreement with <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> calls for up to 100 Cubans a month to be returned. About 500 are still in custody of the 2,746 <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> agreed in 1984 to take back, <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudeck </PERSON>, coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> to Support Cuban Detainees, said in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The others have been paroled, and some have appeals pending. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> is to rule next week on a temporary injunction against the deportation of 10 other Cubans from a federal prison at <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION>, 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. The judge last week refused to halt deportation of three of the five who left Friday; the other two did not fight repatriation. The three unsuccessfully took their cases to an appellate court in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which ruled 8-1 against them Friday. `` This is a giant leap toward normalization with <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Penalver </PERSON> said. `` It's the normalization of our deportation laws and the application of normal deportation laws to the community. `` For 30 years it has been <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy to defer deportation of Cuban nationals until Cuban rights were restored in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Nothing has changed in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to justify a change of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy at this time. `` Furthermore, I think it's inconsistent and self-defeating for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to send human beings who have completed serving their sentences for whatever wrong they committed here to the very same jails that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> condemns for the atrocities that take place there,'' <PERSON> Penalver </PERSON> said. The Cubans who fought deportation claimed they would face mistreatment in their homeland. In the 1980 boatlift, about 125,000 people, some of them convicts or mentally ill, sailed illegally from <LOCATION> Mariel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Botanical artist and explorer <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Mee </PERSON>, who braved blood-sucking gnats, malaria and drunken gold prospectors in pursuit of rare flowers in the deepest Amazonian rain forests, died in a car accident, her family said. Mrs. <PERSON> Mee </PERSON> was 79. She was killed Wednesday in an auto crash near <LOCATION> Seagrave </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, her family announced Friday. In 1952, she and her second husband, <PERSON> Greville </PERSON> <PERSON> Mee </PERSON>, went to live in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. She had recently returned to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to open an exhibition of her paintings at the <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Botanic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION> in west <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Mee </PERSON> was also in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for the publication last month of her diaries, `` In Search of the Flowers of the <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forests </ORGANIZATION>,'' and a lecture tour. Mrs. <PERSON> Mee </PERSON> was born near <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and studied art as a child. She made the first of her 15 <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> expeditions in 1956 to observe, collect and paint flowers. Her last trip there was in May when she traveled to the <LOCATION> Igapo </LOCATION> forest on <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Negro </LOCATION> to paint the rare, night-blooming Amazonian moonflower. `` As I stood there with the dim outline of the forest all around, I was spellbound. Then the first petal began to move and then another as the flower burst into life,'' she wrote in her diaries. Mrs. <PERSON> Mee </PERSON> packed a gun with her brushes and watercolors. On one journey, drunken gold prospectors burst into her hut in an Indian village, she wrote. She told them it was not proper to enter a lady's hut when the lady was alone, and they left. Hours later, their leader returned, but when he found himself looking down the barrel of a .32 - caliber revolver he left, she wrote, Other hazards included snakes, poisonous spiders, blood-sucking buffalo gnats and several bouts of malaria and Mrs. <PERSON> Mee </PERSON> also became a leader in the campaign to conserve the rain forests and protect the forest Indians. In 1986, she was made a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Linnean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, the prestigious botanical society named after the 18th-century Swedish botanist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Linne </PERSON>.

 A five-year plan to open the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marketplace to products from the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> has been successful despite a 30 percent decline in exports from the region during the program, a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official says. When President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> first proposed the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> Initiative in 1982, the region was suffering from low export earnings, declining commodity prices, stagnant productivity and dried-up private investment, said <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs. `` Now, only five years later, <ORGANIZATION> CBI </ORGANIZATION> countries are turning their economies around,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> told the region's leaders Friday at the 12th annual <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> blamed the 30 percent decline in export earnings on falling oil prices, and said that aside from oil, `` exports from the region have been growing.'' Although <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and Central American nations have long been critical of lowered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> import quotas for such traditional regional exports as oil and sugar, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> sees such cutbacks as vital to the program's success. `` In the final accounting,'' he said, `` It is the growth of non-traditional exports which is the most important and the most promising outcome of the initiative.'' Area nations become more competitive and less economically vulnerable with broader export portfolios, such as fly-fishing lures made in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, fine mahogany furniture in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and installation of free trade zones _ creating more than 80,000 new jobs _ in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. While <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures show $ 1.5 billion has been invested in <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> countries since the program started, continued expansion will depend on efforts towards `` long-term, self-sustaining economic growth,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> also credited the program with fostering democracy in the region. `` The Caribbean of the 1980s has been marked by smooth democratic transitions through open elections,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said on the final day of the conference. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a telephoned message to the conference, agreed. `` Today, freely elected democratic governments are in power in virtually all countries in the region,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in the call from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Through regional cooperation, a totalitarian regime was ousted in <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, and there are now four thriving democracies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> attributed regional economic growth to the initiative and economic reforms undertaken by nations in the region. `` The economic and political achievements of the region over the past eight years do not bear the label ` Made in the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>,''' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` These changes were made by the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> _ all the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>.'' Another vote of confidence in the program came from <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Eugenia </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, who also addressed the conference. `` Anyone who says <ORGANIZATION> CBI </ORGANIZATION> was a case of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> designs being pushed down our throats either does n't know what he's talking about _ or was n't there,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> said.

 Hundreds of shantytown dwellers hurled rocks at police who prevented them from storming the Union Carbide pesticide plant today, the fourth anniversary of a gas leak that killed more than 3,300 people. Police said they arrested at least 200 of the demonstrators. Protest organizers put the arrest total at 500. Most of the protesters, estimated by reporters to number 1,000, came from shantytowns lying in the path of the deadly white cloud of methyl isocyanate that leaked out of the plant Dec. 3, 1984. A few demonstrators suffered minor injuries in scuffles with police, who carried steel-tipped bamboo canes but no firearms. There was no sign of injuries to police. Five activists from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> broke away from police and scaled the 8-foot-high wall surrounding the derelict factory complex, but four of them were grabbed by plainclothes police. The fifth succeeded in climbing a watchtower and briefly hoisted the party flag before police hauled him and the red banner away. `` We want justice! We want justice!'' the crowd shouted in Hindi. Some called for the public hanging of <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who was president of the U.S.-based multinational corporation when the gas leak occurred. Last year, the Indian government filed murder charges against <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and abroad in conjunction with its $ 3 billion damage suit against the <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, Conn.-based company. The damage suit, initiated in 1986, has bogged down in a maze of legal maneuvers in courts in <LOCATION> Madhya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state, which includes <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>, and in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and the others have not responded to summonses on the murder charges. Effigies of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> were set ablaze outside the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> plant Friday night and again today. The Communist Party was the most visible organizer of today's protests, but other opposition parties and activist groups campaigning for the rights of gas victims participated in vigils at the plant gates <PERSON> Balkrishna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> secretary for <ORGANIZATION> Madhya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pradesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, said 500 demonstrators were arrested. Police Superintendent <PERSON> Panna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lal </PERSON> said, `` A couple hundred have been arrested, but we have not yet made a head count.'' Reporters who watched the arrested being taken away in eight government buses estimated the total at 400. Police sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the demonstrators would be released without charge within a few hours. Such detentions are legal under Indian law and are commonly used to break up protests. About 500 uniformed police were on hand for the demonstration. Some had tear gas but did not use it. The government says the official death toll from the 1984 gas leak has reached 3,329. Gas Relief Commissioner <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saytam </PERSON>, a state official whose office records the deaths and administers relief, said gas victims continue to die at a rate of at least one a day. About 20,000 survivors still suffer from exposure to the gas. Most say they have respiratory and eye problems. Union Carbide said the leak was caused by sabotage by a disgruntled employee.

 Searchers traveled the river deltas and channels of southern <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> today looking for more than 3,000 people missing after a cyclone that killed at least 1,300 people. Officials said the death toll from Tuesday night's cyclone had reached 900 in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and 400 in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s neighboring <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> state. <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers said the <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> toll may be as high as 1,500. The core of the cyclone and the hardest winds struck the lightly populated Sunderbans forest, an expanse of mangrove trees that sprawls across the <LOCATION> Bangladesh-India </LOCATION> border. Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said most of the forest dwellers were safe. But fishermen who had established colonies along the Sunderbans coast were hit hard. The independent <ORGANIZATION> Ittefaq </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said hundreds of bodies were seen floating in the Sunderbans channels and in the river deltas of <LOCATION> Khulna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bagerhat </LOCATION> districts east of the forest region. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quereshi </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said the death toll had reached 900 and may exceed 1,000. Another official at the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION>, the Moslem equivalent of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, said 3,000 people, mostly fishermen, were missing. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. Bangladeshi newspapers reported death tolls ranging from 1,000 to 1,500. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> Finance Minister <PERSON> Asim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dasgupta </PERSON> said 400 deaths had been officially confirmed, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> called a special Cabinet meeting Sunday to discuss relief and rehabilitation efforts. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> officials and foreign relief workers estimated that 40 percent to 70 percent of the rice crop, the staple in the national diet, was destroyed or damaged by the storm. The Sunderbans forest is the home of the royal <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> tiger, but there were no official reports of tiger deaths. The Ittefaq newspaper, however, said hundreds of animals were killed in the Sunderbans. Tiger deaths in the forest have gone unreported in the past. Newspapers have said game wardens like to sell the tiger pelts, and if they reported tiger deaths they might have to give the pelts to the government.

 A mental patient being held in the slayings of five people in two states demanded to see `` Highway to Heaven'' star <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> just before he shot two Universal City guards to death, officials say. `` Prior to the shooting, the suspect went on the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> tour,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Roop </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Department. `` He asked several studio employees if he could talk to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON>, but was denied access.'' <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Trupp </PERSON>, asked studio guards Thursday if he could use the telephone in their shack to contact <PERSON> Landon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roop </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Trupp </PERSON> left when a guard told him to use a pay phone, but returned and began shooting, the sergeant said.

<TEXT>
 A proposal for direct talks between Tibetan and Chinese leaders on the future of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> is running into serious difficulties, sources close to <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s government-in-exile said today. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Chinese appear reluctant to meet in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in January, as proposed by the Tibetans, and would prefer to meet in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, a venue long rejected by the Tibetan side. The sources suggested a <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> venue would portray the Tibetan issue as an internal Chinese matter, rather than an international one that could be perceived as Chinese recognition of Tibetan demands for self-rule. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> in 1949 and annexed it a year later. Many Tibetans have long insisted on independence for their Himalayan mountain region, but their spiritual and temporal leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, suggested in June that <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> could become `` a self-governing democratic politicial entity ... in association with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' In his biggest concession so far, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> could continue to handle <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s foreign relations and keep troops on Tibetan soil. Senior Tibetan officials in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> declined to confirm the reports that the Chinese were reluctant to meet in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Lodi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyari </PERSON>, minister for information and international relations in the self-styled government-in-exile, said: `` We are not denying them.'' The Chinese Embassy in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> had no reply to the report. The embassy's chief spokeswoman was out of town, and an aide said no one else could comment. The reports of Chinese reluctance to meet a <LOCATION> Tibetan </LOCATION> delegation in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> surfaced after the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s Cabinet convened a special meeting in <LOCATION> Dharmsala </LOCATION> on Nov. 25. The meeting was attended by the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s elder brother, <PERSON> Gyalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Thondup </PERSON>, who had just returned from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thondup </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong-based </LOCATION> businessman, has long served as a go-between for the Tibetans and Chinese.

It was not possible to independently verify the report, which did not say what motivated the guerrillas to attack the town.

 The federal government has reversed its policy of counting loans as income for welfare recipients after a <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> lawsuit showed the practice violated the law since its inception five years ago, officials said. The lawsuit and similar cases in other states, including <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, prompted the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> to chang the policy Tuesday, according to a motion filed Friday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` We feel good. We feel real good,'' said attorney <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which represents poor people. <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardett </PERSON> said he could not say how many people nationally would be affected by the policy change. The motion filed by Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> asked Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> to delay a final decision in the 1986 class-action lawsuit filed by <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of state residents denied benefits under the loan policy. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was named as a third party in the lawsuit but was not involved in a proposed settlement between the state and <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Anticipating the judge's ruling against the federal government in the case, attorneys for the federal agency requested a 30-day delay in a final order so they also could work out a settlement. The proposed settlement, which must be approved by <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, was filed Wednesday. In the proposed settlement, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> agreed to repay 60 people $ 11,767 for welfare payments that were denied when personal loans were counted as income, making them ineligible for benefits. Deputy state Welfare Division Administrator <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Willden </PERSON> said he was pleased by the federal government's latest move. The Welfare Division had disagreed with the loan-as-income policy since federal authorities forced it on the states in 1983, he said. The Aid to Dependent Children program is funded 50 percent by the federal government. `` The loans should have never been counted,'' <PERSON> Willden </PERSON> said. `` But we had no choice. We would have lost our federal funding. I think this lawsuit did turn the policy around. `` It was clearly shown that the administration's regulations were violating the welfare laws.'' <PERSON> Willden </PERSON> said it cost <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> more than $ 40,000 to locate people unqualified for welfare benefits by the loan policy. Initial estimates showed as many as 3,000 people in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> might have been affected by the policy, but most could not be found. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Welfare Division from counting loans as income in determining benefit eligibility pending the outcome of the lawsuit.

 The blood disease snail fever has been contracted by 1 million people in southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and has made a comeback in some areas where it had previously been wiped out, an official daily said today. The People's Daily said the resurgence of the occasionally fatal disease occurred because of lax control by local governments and a drop in funding to eradicate the disease-bearing oncomelania, a freshwater snail. The overseas edition of the daily said the disease has returned to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and areas of the southern provinces of <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> where it had previously been eliminated. Snail fever, also known as schistosomiasis, is prevalent in 12 provinces, and is most serious in riverside or swampy areas of <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jiangxi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> provinces. The disease, transmitted into the bloodstream by a parasite, results in fever, distended stomach, rashes, inflammation of the liver and in severe cases death. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says it has cured more than 11 million sufferers, or 95 percent of all victims of the disease, since 1949.

<HEAD>Judge to Decide if U.S. Was At War With Nicaragua</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal judge agreed to decide if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was at war with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in the mid-1980s, the key issue in the case against six men accused of illegally providing military aid to the Contras. In a pretrial hearing Friday, the defendants argued that the Neutrality Act, under which they were indicted, applies only to nations with which the nation is at peace, and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> conducted a de facto war against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government. They are asking that the case against them be dismissed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roettger </PERSON> held the hearing on the `` at-peace'' issue over the objections of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, which sought to delay the matter until the trial `` It will indeed be an historical decision, whatever the court determines,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Savitz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roettger </PERSON> continued the hearing until Jan. 5, and said he would decide the issue shortly thereafter. The defense Friday presented volumes of Iran-Contra committee and <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> reports to back up its contention that even during the periods when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> halted military aid to the rebels, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration continued to run a war against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, whose brother <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> is one of the defendants, took the stand to testify that former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> provided the rebels with $ 32 million during the congressional cutoff, much of which was spent on arms. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support actually increased during the 1984-85 period of the aid cutoff and the defendants' alleged illegal activities. `` They told us that the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue to solicit funds for us,'' sai <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>. `` They said they would continue to support us, and that we should not give up.'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Debelier </PERSON> tried to draw distinctions between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military actions, including the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War, saying that in those cases the executive branch received congressional support. The judge seemed to dismiss that argument, however, mentioning <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and raids on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. `` The only distinction with the Nicaraguan situation is that you have one branch of government expressing its displeasure,'' <PERSON> Roettger </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Debelier </PERSON> noted that much of the testimony regarding support for the Contras revolved around commitments made and privately raised funds provided by <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who is under indictment for his role in aiding the rebels. `` You ca n't say that because two or three members of the executive branch are going to solicit funds for the Contras, that is the same as binding the government'' to warlike activities in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the prosecutor said. The group was indicted in June after charges of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration foot-dragging during the highly publicized investigation. Opponents of aid to the Contras accused Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of stalling the case because it threatened to uncover illegal activities by <PERSON> North </PERSON>. When the indictment _ along with a similar one filed against six other men accused of running a Contra training camp in the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> _ was finally made public, it accused Contra supporters of violating the Neutrality Act by launching operations against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soil from October 1984 to March 1985. The seven original defentants were <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Posey </PERSON>, head of the Alabama-based Civilian Material Assistance group; <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, a former supply manager for the rebels; <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>'s former bodyguard; <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON>, a former mercenary who turned against the effort and went to authorities; <PERSON> Maco </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, a wealthy former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> businessman and state official who now lives in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Coutin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> and former <ORGANIZATION> CMA </ORGANIZATION> liaison in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a conservative Cuban-American stockbroker The indictment accuses them of recruiting and training mercenaries to fight with Contras, supplying them with equipment, leading them on expeditions, including one aimed at blowing up a Nicaraguan bridge, and violating firearms laws. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> allegedly financed some of the activities. Some of the defendants, including <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Posey </PERSON>, have produced documents showing the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies were aware of their activities, and have said that knowledge of their activities went all the way to the White House. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> pleaded guilty. He was fined $ 50 and sentenced to a day of probation. The other six defendants continue to fight the charges.

 <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> admitted knocking his illegally adopted daughter, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, to the floor on the night prosecutors say he beat the 6-year-old to death, his former live-in lover testified at his murder trial. `` I knocked her down and she did n't want to get up again. This staring business -LRB- by <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> -RRB- had gotten to be too much,'' <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> as saying. The conversation during a cocaine-smoking session a few hours after the incident the night of Nov. 1, 1987, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> testified Friday in state court. The next morning, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> sounded `` frantic'' as he called for her, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said. `` And I came running back into the bedroom and he said, ` She stopped breathing.' And he was frantically trying to revive her.'' Minutes later, she said, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> told her to call the 911 emergency number and she did. The unconscious girl was taken to a hospital, where she died three days later of a brain hemorrhage. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46, is the key prosecution witness against <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. Her testimony was the first the jury has heard directly implicating him in the blows that the prosecution says killed the girl. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a 47-year-old disbarred lawyer, is charged with second-degree murder. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was also arrested after <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death, but charges against her were dropped and she agreed to testify against him Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> had angrily accused <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> of practicing `` a stare that was supposed to hypnotize the person stared at.'' In her second day of testimony, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said she once viewed <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> as `` godlike'' and tried to protect him when he severely beat and brainwashed her. Speaking deliberately, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said she was cut off for years from her family and friends. During one period, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> forbade her from leaving their apartment without his permission; she lost her job as an editor at <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after repeatedly missing work because of black eyes, she said. `` Most of the time he made me sleep on the floor or in the bathtub if I had displeased him,'' she testified. Asked about her relationship with <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> in late 1983 or early 1984, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> replied, `` At that time, he began beating me severely.'' Prosecutors also submitted as evidence commandments that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> issued to Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> that came under the page heading, `` My goals in terms of <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>'s interest.'' He also would force her to write `` punishment lessons'' much like an errant pupil, writing each item 10 times, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said. Among the things she was forced to write: `` Anger is destructive, not constructive.'' Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> instructed the jury that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was on trial for the crime he is charged with `` and not for being a particular kind of person.'' The judge had agreed to a prosecution argument that the only way it could explain Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was incapable of saving the girl on the night <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was fatally injured was to show the extent to which she had been dominated by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> testified Thursday that she did n't call for emergency help for <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> because she thought <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> had the power to heal the unconscious girl. The trial is scheduled to continue Monday.

<HEAD>Report: U.S.-built Spanish Jet Crashed Due To Mechanics' Error</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Faulty installation and assembly of a jet engine by <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> air force mechanics caused last month's crash of a U.S.-built F-18A Hornet fighter-bomber, a newspaper reported today. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s leading daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pais </ORGANIZATION> said preliminary results of a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> probe indicated the error caused the twin-engine jet to crash and burn Nov. 7 in a field near an air base outside the northern city of <LOCATION> Zaragoza </LOCATION>. The pilot parachuted to safety a minute after takeoff, when an engine caught fire and an anti-fire instrument failed to put out the blaze, the paper said, citing unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> sources. The paper said the sources described the inability of the anti-fire instrument to extinguish the flames as `` very strange'' and made them think oil, lubricants or some other material kept the fire alive. Both engines were new and had been recently installed to replace the original ones. A military guard on duty at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> today that no one would be available to comment on the report until Monday. The accident provoked criticism of the Socialist administration of Premier <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> for buying 72 F-18A Hornets from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> maker <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.6 billion, the country's largest single military purchase. The investigation involved experts from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jet engine maker <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> and was to present its formal findings in the next few days, the paper said.

<HEAD>Reforms Make Effort to Compromise with Republics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today published details of its new government structure that retains central control over the 15 republics while attempting to compromise with their demands for more autonomy. Publication in all major Soviet daily newspapers gave Soviet citizens their first look at the final version of a political structure that will govern them beginning in March. After an intense five-week public debate in which a quarter million suggestions were made for changes, the Supreme Soviet, or parliament, and its Presidium, the country's highest executive body, approved changes in about half the articles. The final project, which President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said is crucial to his reform effort, was approved Thursday by the 1,500-member Supreme Soviet with five `` no'' votes. The reforms will establish a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, two-thirds by popular vote and a third by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, trade unions and other organizations. The deputies will pick members of a smaller two-house Supreme Soviet that will meet twice a year for four months at a time. The current body meets several days a year. The president becomes the head of the the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and has the right to conduct international negotiations and sign treaties. Among the articles apparently watered down in the final draft was one that republics opposed because they said it called into question their right to secede from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The final draft gave the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies the power to `` make decisions on matters of national-state structure which are in the jurisdiction of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.'' Previous language had given it the power to make decisions `` on the composition of the U.S.S.R.'' The new law establishes similar Congresses of People's Deputies in the 15 republics as well, but leaves it to the republics' constitutions to outline their powers The original draft included a lengthy list of powers of the republics' congresses. That also appeared to be an effort to compromise with officials from the republics, especially <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. Estonian President <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruutel </PERSON>, in a speech to the Supreme Soviet, said the republic did not want to be forced to form a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is impossible to find an optimum -LRB- political system -RRB- for all regions of the country,'' <PERSON> Ruutel </PERSON> said. `` So we have created our own.'' <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> has led opposition to the constitutional changes. On Nov. 16 its Supreme Soviet made a `` declaration of sovereignty'' in internal affairs, and proclaimed its right to approve all new national laws. The national government declared the move unconstitutional. The final version of the law gives the republics more representatives in the Soviet of <ORGANIZATION> Nationalities </ORGANIZATION>, one of the two houses of the Supreme Soviet, and also ensures they be represented on a new constitutional oversight commission. It orders directives of the central government to be published in the languages of the republics. But it also gives the national Presidium specific powers to ensure that the constitutions and laws of the republics correspond to the national constitution. There were complaints that giving organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and unions the right to elect one-third of the members of the national <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would violate the principle of one man, one vote, by allowing union or party members to vote more than once, or even hold several seats. The final draft says that in selecting the Supreme Soviet, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> must make sure that members of the party or other organizations not be over-represented. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in a speech Nov. 29, told the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> it would have the right under the law to veto any order from him or from the Presidium. Under the new law, however, the presidency still is more powerful than the largely ceremonial post <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> now holds. The new structure goes into effect with the election of the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies on March 26, 1989.

<TEXT>
 The nation's bicentennial inaugural festivities next month have something for everyone, from glamour-seekers and history buffs to children, chocolate lovers and ordinary citizens trying to get in on the action. `` We want to make sure that everybody who wishes to can participate,'' said <PERSON> Ownie </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the American Bicentennial Presidential Inaugural Committee. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be sworn in Jan. 20 as president in the nation's 51st formal inaugural ceremony, amid <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags from 1789, 1889 and 1989 and red bunting recalling <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s inauguration 200 years ago The oath-taking on the West Front of the Capitol, overlooking the city and the Mall, will be a solemn contrast to four days full of official and unofficial parties, pageants, balls, receptions, galas, salutes, celebrations and festivals. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON>, director of the presidential inaugural committee, has said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> inauguration will feature more free activities than ever before. A sketchy schedule released last week shows at least three major events for children and youth, including a festival entitled `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> to <PERSON> George </PERSON> _ Two Hundred Years.'' Some of the capital's best known landmarks will once again be the sites of inaugural balls, including the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Space Museum, the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the grandly restored Union Station. The inaugural planners' goal of broad participation is in keeping with the open, relaxed style of <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But there will be glamour aplenty, what with nine balls and innumerable other upscale events. Roll Call, the weekly <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> newspaper, published a special inauguration preview section suggesting `` 10 places to throw your inaugural party'' and noting that `` for inaugural week, a limo can be a must.'' The newspaper also canvassed fashion experts at local department stores and concluded that inaugural dress this year will run to `` ultra-formal, sophisticated classics.'' Capital area hotels are pulling out all the stops for inauguration week guests, with special menus, patriotic decorations and individual perks including chocolate elephant lollipops, white chocolate replicas of the White House and six-inch square chocolate pianos filled with sweets. `` It's a grand piano. The lid is up. The truffles and goodies are inside the piano where the strings would be,'' explained Park Hyatt spokeswoman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. `` You can eat the whole blooming piano.'' Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inaugural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> declined to discuss how much money they hope to raise to pay for the festivities. The price tag could be higher than ever before, since a new law requires the committee to reimburse the Pentagon for its expenses in helping plan, staff and execute inaugural activities. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1985 inauguration committee raised more than $ 12 million to pay for its events, but a congressional study found that the use of federal employees cost taxpayers another $ 15.5 million. The Pentagon alone spent $ 10 million and used 8,400 military personnel who served as chauffeurs and escorts, musicians and coat-checkers, photographers and even organizers of receiving lines. The two exceptions to the reimbursement rule are the inaugural ceremony and a lunch for the president, vice president and congressional leaders, both traditionally organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Inaugural Ceremonies. The committee will distribute 70,000 inaugural tickets to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, 40,000 to Republicans and another 30,000 to the press, governors, diplomats and other customary guests. `` If if's too cold to have it outside, the guest list goes from 140,000 to approximately 950,'' the amount that will fit inside the <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rotunda </ORGANIZATION>, said congressional committee director <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruehling </PERSON>. He said preparations for an indoor ceremony will be made in advance, `` which guarantees that it wo n't happen.'' While <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took his first oath outside the Capitol in balmy 55-degree weather, a record high for Inauguration Day, his second inaugural ceremony was forced indoors due to a record low temperature of 7 degrees. The parade was canceled, to the disappointment of hundreds of thousands of prospective spectators and young marching band members. There was one inaugural week parade in 1985 _ a <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> march down <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> led by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a two-time contender for the Democratic presidential nomination. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> capped the march by blasting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for `` taking from the poor and giving to the rich'' and characterized the inaugural goings-on as `` vulgar expressions of ostentatiousness, private airplanes and long limousines and $ 25,000 dresses and diamonds from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' This year the mood is somewhat different. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> lunched with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House last week and came away smiling. `` I'm impressed with the vice president's openness,'' he said `` Whatever I can do in some role, I would.''

<TEXT>
 A resegregation campaign by right-wing town councils is prompting many whites, including government leaders, to denounce racist practices that are legal and a few years ago were commonplace. In effect, the revival of hard-line apartheid launched in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> and half-dozen other towns in the past week has provided whites with a mirror reflecting how blacks nationwide have been treated in recent decades. To a large extent, whites do n't like what they see. `` I feel so embarrassed to be from <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, a housewife, at a meeting convened Thursday by residents opposed to the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> majority which took over the town council in elections Oct. 26. The council voted Nov. 24 to resegregate public facilities _ including the town hall, recreation areas and a large lakeside park _ that had been opened to all races in recent years. In the next few days, several other Conservative-controlled councils announced similar plans _ one said it might impose a curfew barring blacks from the town of <LOCATION> Carletonville </LOCATION> at night. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> accused the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of an `` unnecessary emotional outburst of racism'' and said its actions could intensify the sanctions campaign against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Discrimination `` based merely on the color of skin'' was wrong, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. Yet <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in power for 40 years, has made no moves to repeal laws that require racial classification of all citizens, that allow towns to bar blacks from public facilities, and that mandate segregation of neighborhoods, public schools and public hospitals. Nationalist leaders ousted the mayor of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> from the party recently because he favored integration of all-white beaches. `` I realize there are still -LRB- whites-only -RRB- signs, but the important point is that we are in a process of removing them,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. But in <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s home city, <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, the National Party-controlled council has refused to integrate buses, swimming pools and recreation centers. The last major reforms in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, say opposition politicians, came in 1973 when parks and libraries were integrated. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a spokesman for the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, termed the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s attitude toward the resegregation campaign `` nonsensical hypocrisy.'' `` If they really do n't like it, why do n't they abolish the Separate Amenities Act and legislate against racial discrimination,'' he said. `` I would give the Conservative Party credit at least for greater honesty in this regard.'' Many whites concerned by the <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> controversy have, for the first time, taken up confrontational pressure tactics that in the past were employed almost exclusively by anti-apartheid activists. Business executives have threatened to cancel planned developments in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> and other re-segregated towns. National sports federations say they will prohibit tournaments in those towns unless the aparthied by-laws are rescinded. Foes of the Conservatives in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> are circulating petitions denouncing the council. Black leaders have encouraged a tough response to the Conservative councils. <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>'s black and mixed-race townships, <LOCATION> Vosloorus </LOCATION> and Reiger Park, are boycotting the town's white-owned stores to grant the council their wish for `` a white Christmas.'' <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jantjes </PERSON>, chairman of the management committee of Reiger Park, called on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to abolish remaining apartheid laws. But he commended the government for allowing integration of many public facilities and for `` turning a blind eye'' to some violations, such as the growing number of blacks who live illegally in `` whites-only'' urban areas. The Conservatives, <PERSON> Jantjes </PERSON> said, `` are taking <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> laws off the shelves and dusting them off.'' At the anti-Conservative meeting Thursday night, attended by about 300 whites, the loudest applause _ a standing ovation _ was given to <PERSON> Sidwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofokeng </PERSON>, the top-ranking local official of <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>'s black township, <LOCATION> Vosloorus </LOCATION>. `` Vosloorus is with you,'' he told the cheering whites. `` The struggle is ours together.'' The next day, <PERSON> Mofokeng </PERSON> and 10 other black leaders entered the new whites-only zone around <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, in a protest covered by dozens of reporters but ignored by police. <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Derby-Lewis </PERSON>, a Conservative member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, described the controversy about <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> as `` media hysteria'' and noted that public facilities are segregated in the constituences of many prominent Nationalist leaders. Said another <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker, <PERSON> Koos </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON>: `` The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has opened so few facilities, there is little for the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to close.''

 A Soviet delegation arrived in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> today to bring home five Soviet hijackers who commandeered a jet in southern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and flew to <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> with a hostage air crew. The 19-member delegation will remain in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> until the five hijackers, who seized a busload of children and then traded the cargo for a plane and $ 3.3 million ransom, are extradited. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has not announced a decision on extradition but has indicated it will comply with the Soviet request. The hijackers were held in a prison near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> pending a final decision on extradition. A spokesman at <LOCATION> Ben-Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> near this coastal city said the captured eight-member crew would leave for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Sunday. State-run <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation includes police investigators and doctors who will examine the hijackers and crew. `` Some officials from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have come to pick up the hijackers,'' said <PERSON> Motti </PERSON> <PERSON> Amihai </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` But there has been no final decision on the Israeli side.'' He added, `` Our policy is we do n't see any reason to keep the hijackers.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has no extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but both nations have signed international agreements on punishing and extraditing hijackers. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> said his country was grateful to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` for their understanding on this matter.'' Some Israeli observers said cooperation on the hijacking could accelerate the process of reconciliation between the countries. The hijackers, four men and a woman, surrendered to Israeli police and freed the crew Friday evening after landing at <LOCATION> Ben-Gurion </LOCATION>. The surrender came at 6:15 p.m., 35 minutes after the Aeroflot Ilyushin-76 set down. The five Soviets stepped off the plane clutching bags stuffed with money, then dumped coins and paper bills _ most of it in American currency _ onto the tarmac to show they were n't carrying explosives. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said the hijackers had a sawed-off shotgun and four pistols. But one of the hostages, flight engineer <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yermilov </PERSON>, said the hijackers were not threatening and seemed `` quite good-natured.'' `` They were five simple criminals who wanted to flee the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s chief of staff, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, said at an impromptu news conference a few yards from the jet. Military vehicles surrounded the plane, which sat under the glare of a yellow searchlight. The episode began Thursday, according to Soviet officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. They said hijackers seized a bus with 30 school-children and a teacher that day and demanded a plane to take them out of the country. The bus seizure occurred in <LOCATION> Ordzhonikidze </LOCATION>, a city 900 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In addition to giving the hijackers a plane and a flight crew, the government handed over 2 million rubles, worth about $ 3.3 million, and some food in return for release of the children and teacher. <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponomarev </PERSON>, deputy <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership including President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had been kept closely informed of details of the operation. <PERSON> Ponomarev </PERSON> identified the ringleader as 38-year-old <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakshiants </PERSON> and said he was a drug-user who first asked to go to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Israeli soldiers said much of the money carried by the hijackers was <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. The soldiers helped scoop it up after it was dumped on the ground, and the hijackers held tightly to the bags as they were led to the <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kabir </LOCATION> prison near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the hijack team was made up of two Russians, two Armenians and a person from the Soviet Ossetian republic near <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. The Soviets broke diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized lands from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> allies. A gradual thaw in relations began in July 1987 when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent a consular delegation to <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> set up a delegation in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in April.

<HEAD>Pollution Ravages China, Cleanup Costs Increasing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s breakneck economic development is endangering the country's environment and saddling society with a huge cleanup bill, the leading paper said Saturday. The People's Daily reported that `` if forceful policies are not implemented,'' the nation faces a future of denuded forests, dirty lakes, barren grasslands and smoggy skies. The report said the twin evils of pollution and misuse of natural resources have reached such a state in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that annual cleanup costs are estimated at about $ 23 billion. `` By the end of the century,'' the paper said, `` if the environment continues to worsen, it will become a major factor limiting economic development.'' The paper said about 1 percent of the country's $ 270 billion gross national product _ or $ 2.7 billion _ should be devoted each year to ecology. But the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported that by October only $ 1.8 billion had been allocated for the purpose, although it said the state planned an increase of 50 percent in coming years. Since 1978, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s gross national product has jumped 100 percent, but the economic and industrial growth has come at an enormous ecological cost _ one which the government has only recently begun to realize. A <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> report said that by the year 2000, nearly half of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 2,800 lakes could be polluted. An earlier survey on 58,900 miles of rivers found that 20 percent were polluted and another 8 percent seriously contaminated. Reports have blamed acid rain, caused by burning the high-sulfur coal that predominates in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, for killing trees in <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION>, a beautiful lakeside metropolis south of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. In the countryside, increased use of chemical fertilizers has seriously affected soil quality and water resources. In addition, `` timber poachers,'' who raid forests for firewood and building materials, have been fingered in the country's continuing problem with deforestation. The People's Daily said Saturday's report was based on a four-year study to forecast environmental conditions in the year 2000. The report said that even if `` forceful policies'' were adopted, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would only be able to treat 53 percent of its liquid waste by the turn of the century. It now treats only about 20 percent of the waste. In addition, the study predicted acid rain would continue to plague highly industrialized areas and the output of solid waste would more than double by 2000. The report said that damage to farmland accounted for the lion's share of the annual financial cleanup cost, demanding about $ 9.7 billion dollars a year Water pollution came next, accounting for $ 4.2 billion in damage annually. Third came the financial loss from denuded forests, followed by air pollution, problems caused by chemical fertilizers and the destruction of water resources.

 Panic buying of salt hit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s southern city of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, sending its prices soaring in some privately run food stores, a pro-Beijing newspaper reported Saturday. The Chinese-language New Evening Post said the price rises violated regulations and the merchants would be held responsible. The report did not elaborate. Rumors that vouchers would be needed to buy salt resulted in long customer lines outside several food stores in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> recently, the newspaper said. <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> is about 90 miles west of this British colony. The price of salt rose from 10 cents to 35 cents at the stores, the newspaper reported without giving the unit of measure of the salt. Provincial and city governments said warehouses were stocked and no voucher program existed, the newspaper reported. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic reform policy has been slowed by inflation that has soared to a post-1950s high of more than 26 percent. There have been recent reports of panic buying of textiles in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and salt in 19 areas, where authorities immediately imposed rations.

<TEXT>
 The strongest political group opposing <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s military rulers split Saturday and expelled its chairman, who has formed a new party. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> expelled <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> after he asked the party on Nov. 25 to remove eight communist or pro-communist members, accusing them of `` engaging in activities detrimental to the interest of the league as well as that of the democratic process.'' <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> said he would `` continue the struggle for democracy'' under the banner of a new party, the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. After the chairman's expulsion, the pro-communist members were allowed to retain membership in the National League for Democracy. The party was formed Sept. 27 by <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> and two other opposition leaders, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> and Gen. Tin Oo, to oppose <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s military rulers. The opposition also contests the general elections planned by the ruling <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> which, under another name, has governed <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> since a 1962 military coup as the sole legal party. More than 500,000 people have enrolled as members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, making it the strongest of the opposition groups. Western analysts have said the opposition must unify to defeat the ruling party. Following weeks of violence and pro-democracy demonstrations, the military under Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> staged a Sept. 18 coup and ruthlessly put down pro-democracy opponents. By official count, his troops have killed more than 450 people since the coup. The general has promised general elections and allowed 157 political parties to register, but no election date has been set. Opposition leaders say the tight control over virtually every aspect of life indicates free and fair elections will not be possible. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> is the daughter of assassinated national hero <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>. Tin Oo is a former defense minister fired by former rule Ne Win, who seized power in the 1962 military coup and led <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> for 26 years on a road of isolation, political repression and economic ruin. Ne Win formally retired in July, but diplomats say he still is the real power in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. After Ne Win's resignation, two other leaders preceded <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, whose rise to power diplomats believe was engineered by the former leader.

<TEXT>
 Soviet officials and Afghan guerrillas today began informal talks on prisoners of war, the future relationship between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the future of the Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. The face-to-face talks in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> resort 600 miles from <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>, were the first between the Soviets and a seven-group guerrilla alliance since the 1979 Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Soviets have met other rebel groups on two occasions earlier this year. Formal negotiations were expected to begin later today or Sunday, sources close to the talks said. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> was chosen as a venue by the Afghan resistance groups because of the influence it wields in the Islamic world. The kingdom has said repeatedly it would consider establishing ties with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> only after Soviet troops complete their withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Soviets intervened there in December 1979. The head of the Soviet delegation was <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, a deputy foreign minister who recently was named ambassador to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the sources said on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Burhanuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON>, leader of the loose alliance of Afghan resistance groups based in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, has been in the kingdom for two weeks. Other rebel leaders were expected to join the official talks later. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> is the second Soviet official to visit <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> in less than a year. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON>, another deputy foreign minister, came in February in what was seen then as a move toward rapprochement between the two countrues. <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> has stressed that the overriding focus for the rebels during the talks will be on complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. More than half of the 100,000 troops have left since <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> signed a U.N.-sponsored accord in April calling for withdrawal. The rest of the troops were supposed to be out by Feb. 15, but the Soviets recently halted the withdrawal to protest what they called continued funding of the guerrillas by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the Marxist government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> are now seeking to convene an international conference to demilitarize <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and set up a coalition government with the rebels. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON>, also a Soviet deputy foreign minister, told reporters in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Friday that the <LOCATION> Vorontsov-Rabbani </LOCATION> meeting was arranged by the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> government with the cooperation of the Afghan government. He said no representatives of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government or <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the main backer of the rebels, will attend the meeting.

 Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian boy and wounded 20 Arabs today as stone-throwing rioters clashed with soldiers in the occupied territories, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports and hospital officials said. An army spokeswoman confirmed the death and said several Palestinians were wounded. She said she could not give an exact number of wounded. In response to the unrest, the army clamped curfews on three <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> towns and barred reporters from entering <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> which, with 100,000 Arab residents, is the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city. The 16-year-old boy was killed in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> when troops opened fire on demonstrators who erected barricades and hurled rocks and bottles at soldiers, the army said. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said the boy was taken to the city's <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> after he was shot in the neck and chest. The youth's death raised to at least 318 the number of Arabs killed since the start of the yearlong <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Eleven Israelis also have died. A 27-year-old man was shot in the head with a plastic bullet in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and taken to <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> where he was in critical condition, a hospital official said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said troops shot and wounded at least five youths when nearly 100 demonstrators threw rocks at cars and soldiers outside a Palestinian elementary school. The army said it was checking the report. Witnesses said soldiers opened fire with rubber bullets and live ammunition when stone-throwing youths outside the school in <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> refused to disperse. The youngest of the wounded was an 11-year-old boy shot in the right leg with a plastic bullet, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said.

<TEXT>
 The federal grand jury investigating <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and former associates at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> may return indictments this week, a newspaper reported Saturday. Unidentified sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that they believe prosecutors are ready to end the 17-month investigation and intend to present an indictment for the grand jury to consider. `` I would guess they're going to come back with an indictment next week. I do n't know what day,'' a source told The Observer. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Toms </PERSON>, who has met with prosecutors, said he believes <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> will be charged with mail and wire fraud involving <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> `` lifetime partnerships'' and with tax violations in connection with <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money spent on <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. Lifetime partners received free lodging at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s Christian theme park in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, in exchange for big contributions to the evangelical empire built by <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> before his downfall in a sex and money scandal in 1987. Prosecutors have reserved a courtroom for Monday through Wednesday for the grand jury to meet. <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> and other sources said they believe prosecutors on Monday will explain what charges they believe ought to be brought. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcraft </PERSON> refused to discuss the secret proceedings. Last month, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s former chief builder, received letters from prosecutors informing them that they are targets of the investigation and inviting them to testify. Only <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, contractor, accepted. He refused to talk with reporters after testifying Wednesday and Thursday. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in a scandal over the payment of hush money to <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, with whom he had a sexual encounter in a hotel room in 1980.

<HEAD>Congressman Complains Social Security Refusing To Spend Money For
Homeless</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has bottled up money to be spent on the homeless at the same time the agency's head is considering spending some $ 1.6 million on souvenir certificates, a congressman complained The attack leveled by Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, at Social Security Commissioner <PERSON> Dorcas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> comes at a time she is quietly campaigning for a post in the administration of President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on human resources, denied that his criticism _ contained in a letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ was designed to derail <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>'s career He urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to `` reject the misplaced priorities'' of <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said he and his subcommittee have had differences with <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> on other matters `` at a time when there was never any question about her continuation in office.'' Meanwhile, on a different matter, <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> announced Saturday that she has rejected a controversial draft proposal to narrow disability applicants' appeal rights. She said she remains convinced that the disability appeals process needs reforms, but said the low-level staff proposal _ which was leaked to a newspaper two weeks ago before reaching her desk _ was not equitable, compassionate or efficient. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> has not acted on part of a 1987 budget act authorizing $ 1.25 million last year and $ 2.5 million this year in grants for homeless outreach projects. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> has argued that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> failed to provide money for the program and that it duplicated other government services. She recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> seek repeal of the program or find an agency more familiar with state grant programs to run it. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wanted states to use the money to find and help homeless people eligible for benefits, particularly the mentally and physically disabled who are entitled to Supplemental Security Income, <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said in the Dec. 2 letter. `` It's really the season that warrants it,'' he said in an interview. `` Here we are with winter upon us. There are people out on the streets who are obviously and clearly qualified for SSI benefits. The purpose of the legislation was to help states reach out and identify those individuals. ... We felt we ought to bring it to the attention of the president-elect.'' <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not only failed to allocate money for the outreach grant program but in fact gave the agency less money in its overall budget than it requested for fiscal 1988 and 1989. `` Therefore we have to rely on other alternative means'' to reach the homeless, <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON> said. He said employees at the 1,300 <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> offices nationwide work closely with shelters and advocacy groups to make sure the homeless receive benefits. `` Commissioner <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> is very much concerned that we deliver our services compassionately and fairly to the homeless. We think we're doing a good job of it,'' <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON> said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> called that claim `` baloney. ... They're not doing any kind of outreach that I can see. Obviously it was the congressional view that the kind of work that was needed was not being done.'' He said there was no specific allocation because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> assumed the agency would fund the relatively tiny grant program from its general budget. At the same time she was fighting the homeless program, <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> was supporting a $ 1.6 million plan to send decorative certificates, suitable for framing, to Social Security beneficiaries. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> approved the plan despite a recommendation to scrap it, according to documents supplied by <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>' office. `` It's a nutty idea,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said. `` It contrasts what she thinks money ought to be spent for as opposed to what the real needs of people are.'' <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> still thinks the certificates are a good idea but they have n't been instituted. `` We have n't killed the proposal, but it is not a high priority at this time based on its cost and our funding situation,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> said today the government will not negotiate with more than 400 heavily armed soldiers who took over a giant military base near the capital. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, who returned home from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today to deal with the crisis, met with his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> and top military aides. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignacion </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s spokesman, told reporters the president `` gave the necessary instructions to re-establish discipline and order where it has broken down and hopes that the problem will be resolved.'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> would not disclose the orders but said <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> would not speak with the rebels, as he did to end a similar insurrection in April 1987. At the sprawling <PERSON> Campo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON> army base, rebels remained in control of an infantry school, surrounded by loyalist troops backed by tanks and mortars. The government claimed on Friday that the uprising, in which one soldier reportedly was killed, `` had been overcome.'' However, a spokesmen for rebel leader Col. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> insisted the rebels had only agreed on a truce pending <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s return from a three-day trip to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> At <LOCATION> Campo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mayo </LOCATION> on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> talks continued between <LOCATION> Seineldin </LOCATION> and Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Gassino </PERSON>, commander of the loyal forces who surrounded the rebel position at an infantry school. The Rev. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jardin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest who claimed to be a friend of <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON>, left the infantry school today and told the private news agency <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Argentinas </ORGANIZATION> the rebels had agreed to `` a truce of several days.'' `` Seineldin has not surrendered nor does he intend to,'' said <PERSON> Jardin </PERSON>. The rebels would consider any movement of loyalist forces a violation of the truce, he said. Vice President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was quoted as saying on Friday that <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> `` accepted absolute responsibility for the episodes,'' and he claimed the uprising had ended. `` The insubordinate soldiers at the infantry school at the <PERSON> Campo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON> now accept the orders of the army chief -LRB- of staff Gen. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Caridi </PERSON> -RRB-,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in a communique Friday. But it remained uncertain whether the uprising was over because <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> was permitted to return to the infantry school, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Argentinas </ORGANIZATION> quoted reporters at the base after midnight as saying they `` very clearly heard a series of 15 or 20 detonations of light arms fire.'' The agency did not elaborate. The insurrection began before dawn Thursday when about 50 members of a <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> unit armed themselves and deserted their station. Army officers tried to incite troops at one army base and another communications facility. The latter two attempts failed. The coast guard unit then drove onto the infantry school grounds Friday morning, joining rebel soldiers. The government said the rebels also tried to free ex-Lt. Col. <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rico </PERSON>, leader of the most recent uprisings in April 1987 and January He is being held in a military prison pending trial. Machine guns were positioned at Government House in downtown. The navy, air force, and army remained loyal. Tanks and armored personnel carriers were sent toward the <PERSON> Campo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON> to quell the uprising, Gen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> was quoted as saying by local news reports. After firing mortars at the rebels, which <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> said numbered 400, one officer was reported killed _ it was not clear from which side _ and about five soldiers were wounded, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION> said. A 19-year-old woman was hit by bullets in the neck and stomach as she walked near the base, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s two private news agencies reported. Her condition was not known. The rebel demands were not clear. The news agencies cited military and rebel sources as saying rebels want to end the prosecution of fellow officers accused of rights abuses during the 1976-83 military rule, as well as gain better pay and equipment.

<TEXT>
 One year after a fired airline employee smuggled a gun aboard a jet to kill his former boss, traces of the crash that killed 43 people have disappeared from a cow pasture but left their mark on the nation's airports. Since the Dec. 7, 1987, crash of <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1771, all airline employees, including uniformed pilots, must pass through security checkpoints. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has closed its criminal investigation and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is expected to issue its report this month. In April, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> proposed computed-coded cards that would allow employees only into areas where they work. The system would reject cards of former employees and note when someone tries to reach a restricted area. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has yet to require the computerized system, said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>. But <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where Flight 1771 originated, has adopted a similar computer-aided card that gives security guards instant access to information about the employee, who must also give a personal identification number. The airport also plans to erect concrete barriers and fences topped with barbed wire to keep intruders off the airfield, said manager <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Yee </PERSON>. Could a gunman carry a weapon onto Flight 1771 today? `` Nothing is absolutely impossible but it would be extremely more difficult to accomplish that,'' said <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, airport executive director. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> also called it unlikely, adding, `` At that time he should n't have gotten through, but he apparently used a card that he kept after he was fired.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, a 14-year <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> employee, smuggled a .44 - caliber Magnum revolver aboard the plane that day and probably shot both pilots en route to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, federal authorities The cockpit voice recorder picked up six shots and fell silent with the plane at 22,000 feet. In seconds, the BAe 146 four-engine jetliner smashed into the pasture, killing all aboard. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s airline badge was found amid the wreckage, providing a clue to how he bypassed security with the gun. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> maintains <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> turned in his badge. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> had been fired as a ticket agent three weeks earlier by <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PSA </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, for allegedly stealing $ 69 in cocktail receipts. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, 48, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s former boss was on the plane. Investigators at the crash site found a note on an air sickness bag that read: `` Hi <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, I think it's sort of ironical that we end up like this. I asked for some leniency for my family, remember. Well I got none and you'll get none.'' At least 31 lawsuits have been filed on behalf of passengers' survivors, according to attorney <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakeslee </PERSON> Many of the cases were consolidated and are scheduled for trial May 1. Several cases have been settled. In June, a granite and bronze memorial was erected at a <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cemetery where 11 never-identified victims are buried. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartzell </PERSON> has reseeded his pockmarked pasture. `` You'd never be able to tell that anything happened,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulhall </PERSON> with the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obispo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` It looks like any other hillside.'' <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottesman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Veradale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, whose daughter <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> was killed in the crash, said she remembers taking the 20-year-old flight trainee to the airport a week earlier. She watched pilots walk unchecked through security and recalled thinking, `` Boy, if you wanted to sabotage a plane it'd be really easy to do it.'' Like other relatives, she remains bitter about the security system that allowed <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> to smuggle the gun aboard. `` It would be nice if it did n't happen; if they were doing their job,'' she said. `` Who can say? It's just a damned shame.'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s mother said her son is missed. `` I do n't believe he do any of those things,'' she said in a telephone interview from her home in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` I do n't know what to say. What happened, only the Lord knows.''

 Voters in this country hard-hit by a drop in oil prices will choose from two dozen presidential candidates in Sunday's election, including a liberal front-runner, a conservative and a witch doctor. Opinion polls have consistently projected <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, a former president, solidly ahead in the contest but with his left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> expected to lose its congressional majority. Independent polls gave <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> a lead between 12 and 15 percent points until last week. But aides of conservative <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> rival <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> claimed early this week both had 41 percent of the those polled. An estimated 10 percent of the nation's more than 9 million voters were still undecided, according to independent polls. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, a 66-year-old leader who nationalized the country's rich oil industry in the mid-70s, has promised to seek `` decent repayment terms'' on the country's $ 33 billion foreign debt. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, 48, says he represents a new generation of leadership, embracing an unconcealed sympathy for the private sector. He plans to sell off many state-run enterprises. Besides the two front-runners, 22 other candidates representing a wide political spectrum, from the first woman candidate to a witch doctor who follows a local Spanish-Indian goddess, also ran mostly shoestring campaigns aiming at least to get seats in the 244-seat national congress, all up for grabs this election. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the electoral process, ordered all parties to cease campaigning Friday and give citizens a two-day break before the election. Estimates place the cost of the campaign at some $ 40 million for each of the two major candidates, 14 times the estimated per capita cost of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campaign. Confident of victory, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> paid no attention to persistent demands for public debates with his main rivals. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> launched an all-out attack the last two weeks, accusing <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of selling out Venezuelan rights in a border dispute with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Perez charged <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> of `` anti-patriotism'' and `` irresponsible electioneering'' for bringing it up. Some of the minor parties stand to win greater representation this election according to polls, a swing away from the major party dominance of that branch of government. The gains could come at the expense of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>'s bloc of 24 out of 44 senators and 113 out of 200 deputies. Social Christians are expected to at least maintain their current position with 14 senators and 60 deputies. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, 66, who governed <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> between 1974 and 1979, a period of unparalleled oil affluence, could be the first to win a second term in 30 years of <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> rule. The constitution bans presidents from seeking re-election until 10 years after their first mandate expires. Perez is responsible for at least half of the country's foreign debt. His administration undertook major projects to develop <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s natural resources. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> aides have said the former president will ask for a 30-year repayment period from creditor banks, more than double the current refinancing accord of 14 years. The foreign debt also was exacerbated by the falling price of oil, which accounts for 90 percent of the country's exports. More than 50,000 troops have been placed on full alert to ensure order at voting stations.

<TEXT>
 Space shuttle Atlantis is carrying two space newcomers, part of a new generation of astronauts with a look and background unlike that of the all-white, crew-cut, All American team who rode the Mercury capsules. Nine more rookies have been named to four future flights, and a new class of astronauts is in training to fill spots vacated by veterans who took other jobs after the shuttle Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986. The space program now has 93 men and women astronauts, with a nearly even mix of experienced space travelers and those who have never flown into space. Within 10 years, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is expected to add more as it responds to the demand of more shuttle flights and begins construction of the space station. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s new astronauts are far different from the seven original ones. The first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> astronauts were all military test pilots, all male and all white. All <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrongs </PERSON> in flight suits. The space shuttles, with room for up to seven crew members, opened new opportunities. In 1978, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> selected women and men, pilots and non-pilots, and black, white, Hispanic and Asian candidates. The newest group, chosen last year, includes the first black woman astronaut, Dr. <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jemison </PERSON>, a physician, and the first <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsman </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melnick </PERSON>. Another group is scheduled to be chosen in January 1990. Despite the loss of the seven Challenger astronauts, the number of applications has increased since the accident, <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said. The competition seems to have stiffened over the years, said <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Garver </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based space advocacy group of about 20,000 people from the general public. `` I do n't know how it could get more competitve from the early days, but it seems to have done just that,'' Ms. <PERSON> Garver </PERSON> said. `` They have experience in all kinds of areas. -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- looks at the whole person and what they have to offer.'' The astroanuts are also more aggressive about voicing their opinions about quality and safety since Challenger, said astronaut <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a Marine colonel. `` Now, people have no qualms about speaking out,'' he said. When Challenger exploded there were 95 astronauts. More than a dozen later retired. Some returned to their military branches; others _ like <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Ride </PERSON>, the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman in space _ left <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to pursue other careers. Fifteen people _ 10 military and five civilians _ were added to the astronaut ranks in August 1987. Two of them are women, Ms. <PERSON> Jemison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. It takes at least four years of training before an astronaut can even be assigned to a flight, and crews generally are named a year before their launch date, Ms. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` I did n't understand before I came here how all-encompassing the job is. We do n't just flip switches and follow check lists. We've got to understand what's going on with all these systems,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who has a doctorate in mechanical engineering <ORGANIZATION> Vance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brand </ORGANIZATION>, a civilian pilot who flew on two shuttle flights and the Apollo-Soyuz joint mission, said there has been an evolution of sorts in the astronaut corps, with a greater diversity of skills and backgrounds. <PERSON> Hee </PERSON> said he expects even more diversity in the future. `` Space is like the American West, the Arctic or <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. It's a new locality where you can do all kinds of different things,'' <PERSON> Brand </PERSON> said

 <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s only nuclear power plant has shut down because of a defect in a recently installed transformer, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. It said the damage at the Krsko plant in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> was caused by a short circuit between the electric equipment and the ground connection causing a sudden drop in the power output and the shutdown of the plant.

It said the transformer was installed Wednesday to replace one damaged in a storm. The 632-kilowatt station has been in operation since the 1970s.

<TEXT>
 An exiled Soviet engineer and an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> security consultant say they are nearly ready to market an anti-terrorism system designed to halt gate crashers with their own horsepower. `` It is quite an old Indian trap idea,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorlov </PERSON>, professor of mechanical engineering at <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and chief designer of the Terrorist Vehicle Arresting System, which can demolish a 15,000-pound truck traveling at 50 mph. The trap consists of two cables and a net stretched across an entryway. If an intruder tries to drive through, the tension on the net and cables rotates a 1,500-pound, spiked turnstile that slams into the side of the vehicle, forcing it against a barrier. After the 1986 terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 241 Marines in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, security officials recognized the need for a more reliable defense against car bomb attacks. Steel barricades that rise from the ground to stop intruders in their tracks have been installed at the entrances of the Capitol, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and many other government buildings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Newell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> resident who worked as a law enforcement consultant much of his 77 years, said those 1,500-pound barricades are difficult to maintain. `` You've got to raise and lower that mass for every vehicle that comes and goes all day long, every day, waiting for 10 years for some guy to crash,'' <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> said. `` People walk by and they see this thing standing there and it makes them think that these people -LRB- inside -RRB- have a bunker mentality.'' In the system developed by <PERSON> Gorlov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Newell </PERSON>, only the 150-pound cables and nylon net that hang a foot off the ground need to be raised and lowered. The cables slide into a groove in the ground at the flip of a switch to admit authorized vehicles and can be returned to position in one second. The turnstile stands at the side of the road, swinging into action only when a gate crasher drags on the net. <PERSON> Gorlov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> have some testing to complete. `` But now we've developed all the details and, practically speaking, we're ready for mass production,'' <PERSON> Gorlov </PERSON> said They said believe they can sell the recently patented system for between $ 15,000 and $ 25,000. <PERSON> Gorlov </PERSON>, 56, and his wife, <PERSON> Ella </PERSON>, formerly professors at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> universities, were banished from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> 13 years ago and settled in <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>. He said he was exlied because of his friendship with Nobel laureate <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitzsyn </PERSON>, who chronicled <PERSON> Gorlov </PERSON>'s brush with the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> in his novel `` The Oak and the Calf.''

<HEAD>Reforms Keep Tight Rein on Republics, Restructure Center</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet citizens got their first look Saturday at the fine points of a new political system that keeps a tight rein on the 15 republics, strengthens the presidency and builds a more dynamic parliament. Major daily Soviet newspapers published details of the reforms, which were approved Thursday by the Supreme Soviet parliament and will go into effect with elections next March 26. The reforms, adopted after five weeks of intense public debate, attempt to forge a compromise between demands by the republics for autonomy and the need for central control by the government in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. But a lawyer for a grass-roots Lithuanian movement scoffed at compromises made to the restive republics and said his organization was writing a complaint over President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms that will arrive at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> about the same time the Soviet leader does `` All the things that choked and are choking us are still there,'' <PERSON> Kazimieras </PERSON> <PERSON> Motieka </PERSON>, a member of the governing council of the Sajudis movement, said in a telephone interview from the Lithuanian capital of <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>. The new system establishes a 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies that will include for the first time members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, trade union and other organizations as well as representatives chosen on the basis of geographical districts and ethnic homelands The congress will choose a smaller, more active Supreme Soviet that is to meet eight months instead of several days a year. Several of the 15 republics, especially the Baltic republics of Lithuanian, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, have complained that the laws as proposed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in October concentrated too much power in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Motieka </PERSON> said the new laws give the national parliament wide power over the economy in the republics. By including property under the jurisdication of the national Supreme Soviet, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> established `` that what is in our republic is not our property,'' he said. `` We ca n't organize our own agriculture,'' he said. `` We ca n't even change wages. Among the articles changed in the final draft of the reform was one opposed by republics because they said it called into question their right to secede from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The final version gave the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies power to `` make decisions on matters of national-state structure which are in the jurisdiction of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.'' Previous language had given it the power to make decisions `` on the composition of the U.S.S.R.'' The language appeared weaker, but <PERSON> Motieka </PERSON> contended that the change was in words only. <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> has led opposition to the constitutional changes. On Nov. 16 its Supreme Soviet made a `` declaration of sovereignty'' in internal affairs and proclaimed its right to approve all new national laws. The national government declared that move unconstitutional, but the Estonian parliament meets Monday to discuss further expressions of autonomy. The final version of the law gives republics more representatives in one of the two houses of the Supreme Soviet and representation on a new constitutional oversight commission. It orders directives of the central government to be published in the languages of the republics. But it also gives the national Presidium specific powers to ensure that the constitutions and laws of the republics correspond to the national constitution. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> leaves Monday for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where he will address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and meet with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He then travels to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Motieka </PERSON> said the governing council of <LOCATION> Sajudis </LOCATION> agreed during a session Saturday to send a complaint to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. A draft was being written and a vote would be taken Sunday, he said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has sized up <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> during nearly two hours of meetings in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and concludes that the Soviet leader is tough, self-confident and outgoing _ `` a new and more enlightened'' leader. At the same time there is nothing in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recent marks to contradict his year-old assessment that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also `` is no freedom-loving friend of democracy.'' In contrast to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s newfound optimism about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its leadership, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had taken a more cautious approach. `` The cold war is not over,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said earlier this year, even as he praised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms as revolutionary. From his personal experience, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knows <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> can be a real crowd pleaser _ in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s words, `` a Western-style communicator.'' During the superpower summit last December, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was along for the ride in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s limousine when the Soviet leader abruptly ordered his driver to halt, jumped out of the car and plunged into a noontime crowd in downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The campaign-style stop delighted onlookers who rushed to greet <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, then a candidate, shared <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s limelight, joining him on the street to shake hands and wave. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will fly to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to accompany <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at a meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Governors Island in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be the man <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will have to deal with after Jan. 20, the vice president promises he'll play a back seat role to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It will be President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says. `` I'll be there as vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and I expect they'll be aware they're talking to the next president.'' <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the White House national security adviser, said the Soviets understand that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role will be secondary to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s and that `` it would not be appropriate then for the vice president to have a separate agenda. Even so, the meeting provides an important opportunity for a smooth transition in superpower relations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leader to meet with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> after he became head of the Soviet government. As <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s emissary, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in March, 1985, for the funeral of Soviet leader <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON>. At the conclusion of that trip, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with the newly named Soviet leader: <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The meeting lasted 85 minutes and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> described their discussions as `` useful'' and `` constructive.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> saw each other again during the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was present in each of the plenary sessions during the three days of talks between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. During that summit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also had a private, 23-minute meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before the two men attended breakfast with other guests. It was after that breakfast meeting that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rode together to the White House and made the impromptu stop. At the end of the summit, when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> went to <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> to depart <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> again was in the limousine with the Soviet leader. Reflecting on the summit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was `` an impressive man _ self-confident, gregarious and obviously intelligent. He is forthright and direct and he has a sense of humor and a Western style that makes him different from his predecessors. `` But make no mistake about it, this is no freedom-loving friend of democracy,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last December. `` He is an orthodox, committed Marxist and a formidable and determined competitor for world power.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has praised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s move toward reforms, saying, `` I am impressed by the steps he has taken for more openness, more reform.'' However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> usually couples his praise with a statement that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be judged ultimately by what its actions on arms reductions, human rights, and regional tensions. In some recent speeches, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has struck a more conciliatory tone toward <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. In an address a month before the presidential election, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his foreign minister, <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, were tough but represented `` a new and more enlightened generation of Soviet leaders in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> _ much better able to communicate with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, more committed to openness and internal reform.'' `` This offers promise but in no way should lessen our commitment to peace through strength _ a policy we must continue,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> In another speech a day later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> again referred to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and said: `` They are serious people. They know they must change. After 70 years of the Marxist-Leninist state, it's pretty hard to explain to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people why they do n't have either bread or freedom, why the food situation is worse than it was a decade ago, or why life expectancy has dropped. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` is clearly a different kind of Soviet leader than we have seen recently. He is prepared to take radical steps. He is able to reverse course when Soviet policies fail, when the costs become too high.'' A week before he was elected, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that should he become president, he would be prepared to meet with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` at the earliest time that would serve the interests of world peace.'' He said he would want to engage in `` a serious and direct examination of where we are and how we can best go forward toward further arms reductions, a decrease in regional tensions and further adherence to human rights and thus toward a surer peace.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> met with defense officials in <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> on Saturday at the start of a four-day <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> tour expected to be the last to the region by a top <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was quoted by the official <ORGANIZATION> Omani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> as saying his trip was aimed at `` renewing the -LRB- American -RRB- commitment for stability in the region'' in the aftermath of the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war. He was to visit <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and go aboard several <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Dec. 7, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. They said a flight deck explosion and fire aboard the aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nimitz </ORGANIZATION> four days ago was not likely to deter plans for <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> to visit that ship, which is operating in the north <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. The accident killed two sailors. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators were trying to determine why a gun on an A-7E Corsair fighter-bomber accidentally fired during an overhaul. The gunburst hit a parked KA6-D Intruder tanker plane loaded with 4,000 gallons of aviation fuel and touched off a fire that damaged seven aircraft. The Arab states on <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s itinerary have provided support for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to protect commercial shipping during the gulf war, which ended in a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire Aug. 20. The Omanis allow <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships to refuel at a base on the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and to have access to other facilities. The arrangements are a particularly sensitive matter in <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, which shares with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> the control of the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the entrance to the gulf, and has maintained the closest ties of any gulf state with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> during the war. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Muscat </LOCATION>, the Omani capital, accompanied by <ORGANIZATION> Assistant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Armitage </PERSON> and other officials. On Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> chief met with <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>'s defense minister, deputy prime minister for security and defense, foreign affairs minister and deputy prime minister for legal affairs, the official news agency said. Senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and diplomats contend that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s relations with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> are the best ever as a result of the American effort to protect shipping President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he will choose his own man to replace <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, but he is expected to maintain the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's stated policy of scaling back <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces if the Iraq-Iran truce holds up. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fleet already has been trimmed by two ships since the cease-fire, to 25 at present _ by far the largest naval force in the region. The number of fleets in the gulf will be down to four by year's end as the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> pull out The remaining fleets are from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was to visit the Nimitz, the flagship <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salle </ORGANIZATION>, the missile cruiser USS <PERSON> Josephus </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> and perhaps one of the six gulf-based <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> minesweepers.

 The atmosphere for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s final meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has brightened with positive human rights moves in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and confidence here that the successful superpower agenda can be passed on to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s decision to end the jamming of U.S.-financed Russian language broadcasts and to ease restrictions on some Jewish dissidents seeking exit permits symbolizes both an improved U.S.-Soviet relationship and the `` pride of place'' human rights has on the agenda. Steps by the Soviet leader to liberalize the Soviet political system are viewed more cautiously. A foreign policy aide to President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did not think <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` democratization'' drive `` has any immediate bearing'' on the meeting Wednesday on Governors Island `` But as you think towards the future, the effort as it proceeds, hopefully with application of the rule of law, it is a positive thing,'' he said Friday. `` This and the end to jamming are the kinds of steps that create a sense of hopefulness.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that even though <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is directing a `` process of change,'' Soviet defense spending has not slowed and emphasized that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intends to approach <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with considerable caution after he takes office Jan. 20. The Dec. 7 meeting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is apt to be marked by goodwill and, as Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said last week, some `` substantive'' conversation. Apart from seeking validation of the four-part agenda that stresses human rights, arms control and cooperation in resolving regional disputes, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will prod <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for a renewed promise to withdraw all Soviet forces from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15. Mindful of the <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> summit two years ago, in which a bouncy <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pressed far-reaching arms control proposals, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side is determined not to be taken by surprise by anything the dynamic Soviet leader might place on the luncheon table. `` We are prepared to deal with any surprise they may come up with,'' Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the president's national security adviser, said Friday. That is, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said, `` we will take it under advisement.'' That indicates <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> does not intend to swap sweeping proposals with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. With only six weeks left in his administration, the president does not intend to negotiate for his successor. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, even if he has an unscheduled separate meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, will not be president for six weeks. Behind the scenes, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> may meet separately with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> for what would be more detailed work than the leaders will undertake at luncheon on Governors Island. `` We have no major new proposals to put on the table,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` I am not aware of anything they propose to put down.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Friday again accusing the Soviets of flouting various arms control agreements with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He threatened to take some unspecified `` proportionate response.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said that unless the Soviets dismantle a disputed radar installation in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> `` we can not conclude new strategic arms control agreements.'' But he stopped short of charging <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with a `` material breach'' of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. And he said the Soviets corrected technical violations of the 1987 treaty to abolish intermediate-range nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges were unlikely to be a `` major issue'' at Wednesday's meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. The Soviet concessions on human rights could do more than contribute to a good atmosphere for the meeting. By putting an end to radio jamming and clearing the way for up to 120 Jewish `` refuseniks'' to emigrate, the Soviets moved closer to meeting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> test for holding a human rights conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration would like to see some other steps taken. These include freeing all prisoners the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> claims are held for political reasons, and allowing members of divided families to emigrate. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s international political moves are also getting a positive, though cautious, reception here. They are viewed as not so much an effort to promote democracy but to make economic reconstruction workable. Still, the Soviet leader plans to establish a new legislature with broad powers and to permit political competition, although within the Communist Party. `` There are a lot of reasons to be hopeful,'' the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> foreign policy aide said.

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who has not been allowed to leave <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since 1981, has been given permission to travel to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> later this month, his wife said Saturday. The change in policy will allow him to attend a ceremony in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Dec. 10 marking the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who was invited by French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, applied for a passport last week and was informed on Saturday that he may pick it up Monday, said <PERSON> Danuta </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, speaking from the couple's home in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was suffering from a flu and cold and was unable to come to the telephone. `` He has gotten a passport. Someone called from the passport office and said he can come and pick it up on Monday,'' she said. `` He's happy that he's going to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and will breathe some different air.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said she would remain in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and take care of the couple's eight children. An aide, <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> would work his travel plans out soon and decide whether to take along other members of the banned Solidarity union. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Olechowski </PERSON> was due to return Sunday from an official visit to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Asked about <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s passport application earlier in the week, he had said he expected it to be issued.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today he feels nostalgic as he faces his last session with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and will use the meeting to introduce his successor as a man who represents `` change, yes, but also continuity.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his weekly rado address delivered from Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said he was looking forward to the upcoming meeting and luncheon on Wednesday, set on Governors Island in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The president recalled that since he first met the Soviet leader in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1985, the U.S.-Soviet relationship has developed and resulted in the first agreement to get rid of an entire class of nuclear weapons. `` This will be our last such meeting, and I must admit that I would not have predicted after first taking office, that some day I would be waxing nostalgic about my meetings with Soviet leaders,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, in a reference to his days as an ardent anti-communist. `` But here we are, for the fifth time, Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and I together, in the hope of furthering peace.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pointed out that despite their agreement on arms control, there is much work to be done over differences on that subject, and on human rights, regional problems, and in bilateral relations. The goal of improved U.S.-Sviet relations `` must continue byond any single presidency or term of office,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, adding that he is `` particularly delighted'' that President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will join the meeting. `` No one is better versed in the details of Soviet-American relations or has a stronger foreign policy portfolio than our vice president,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` So, on our get-together next week ... you can be sure I'll be telling Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> represents change, yes, but also continuity,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials expect no surprises at the luncheon meeting next week, and that if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> presents some totally unexpected proposal, as the Soviet leader did in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> two years ago, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials will not allow themselves to be forced to make a snap reply. The <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> summit collapsed when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> disagreed over the Soviet leader's demand that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president substantially downgrade his Star Wars missile-defense program. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were widely criticized after the October 1986 summit, with political opponents accusing the American side of having been unprepared to cope with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s bold proposal. `` Based on what we have heard from the Soviets, I am not aware of any that they're planning to put down on the table,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` But I do n't have, obviously, complete control over what the general secretary might suggest,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> continued. `` And if he does have some ideas that we have not heard before, we will listen carefully, respond or take them under advisement as the case may be.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> also said that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have `` no major new proposals to put down on the table'' on Governors Island in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> next Wednesday.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> on Saturday ordered about 1,000 political prisoners released and commuted all death sentences in her first official act after assuming power. She also promised to free all women prisoners except those convicted of murder. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, sworn in Friday, told a news conference her <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> amnesty program will be handed over to President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> for approval. Her new law minister, <PERSON> Etiaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahssan </PERSON>, refused to say where <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> stood on the amnesty but said the president had to act on the advice of the prime minister. In her first nationally televised address, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> on Friday promised sweeping reforms, including lifting bans on student and trade unions and launching a new education program to help fight the nation's 75 percent illiteracy rate. All prisoners over 60 years old are to be released providing they have served five years of their sentence, <PERSON> Ahssan </PERSON> said. He said all prisoners except military officers convicted of non-criminal offenses by military courts under late President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> are to be freed. The military will review its own cases, said <PERSON> Ahssan </PERSON>. In addition, all sentences are to be reduced by three months, he said. The prime minister offered freedom to `` all persons convicted and sentenced by a military court for offenses not involving drugs, smuggling, corruption, embezzlement, bank fraud, robbery, dacoity, murder and rape.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> tempered far-reaching economic promises with a warning that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s financial books were deep in red ink. `` We are anxious to have foreign investment in our country to have economic growth,'' she said. `` But ultimately it's the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> labor we are looking toward'' to help rebuild the economy. She said the economy left by Gen. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s military and civilian governments has `` left the country close to bankruptcy.'' However, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> gave few details. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> died in a mysterious plane crash Aug. 17, weeks after announcing the Nov. 16 general elections that swept Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s party to power Authorities suspect sabotage in the crash, and a probe is continuing. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, was overthrown by <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> in a bloodless coup in 1977 and executed in 1979 after his conviction for killing a political rival. The <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> family has denied the charge. `` I think he would be proud of me,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said of her father. `` He was a pragmatist. I'm his daughter but he brought us up to be our own person.'' This month Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> will meet leaders of countries of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION>. On Thursday, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> expelled two <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> diplomats, charging them with spying, and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> reciprocated with the expulsion of two Indian diplomats the following day. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said she's optimistic that the Dec. 29-31 regional summit can be used to `` defuse the tensions between our countries.'' The party's stand on the 10-year war in neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, which has resulted in more than 3 million refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, wo n't change, said Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are staunch backer of Moslem rebels fighting <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed government. `` We look forward to a successful conclusion of the Soviet withdrawal by next February and the induction of a government representative of the national aspirations of the people of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' she said. The Soviets agreed under a U.N.-mediated accord to withdraw all of its more than 100,000 combat troops by next Feb. 15. In her Friday speech, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> also dissolved the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, which was established in 1960s to control 11 publications, many of them influential. The chairman of the board was appointed by the president.

<HEAD>Cambodia Shells Guerrilla Positions, Aid Not Reaching Refugees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Cambodian gunners pounded <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla positions in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, and aid officials said Saturday they have not been able to reach Cambodian refugees who may have been wounded or killed. The shelling was directed at an area inside eastern <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Trat </LOCATION> province, a border area where the guerrillas have herded about 7,000 refugees from the U.N.-aided camp of Ta <PERSON> Luan </PERSON> The communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the largest guerrilla gruop opposing the Vietnam-backed Cambodian government, apparently plan to use the refugees to populate areas of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from which Vietnamese forces have withdrawn. The shelling peaked in mid-November in the most intense cross-border bombardment since 1985. On Tuesday, an aid official who visited Ta <PERSON> Luan </PERSON> and the nearby <PERSON> Sok </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> camp said he heard `` one shell a minute'' crashing into the forested hills. <PERSON> Sok </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> camp is controlled by the the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, one of two non-communist guerrilla groups allied with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. Many of the hundreds of wounded rebels were taken to Camp 85, a major <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> military complex, according to an aid official who quoted sources at Site 8, the largest of four <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> border camps to which the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has access. The shelling has driven about 3,000 of the refugees from the border back to Ta <PERSON> Luan </PERSON>, but no information was available on how the shelling affected the refugees. At the border, the refugees had pitched platic tents while they built huts made of bamboo or papaya trees. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> told the refugees they must return to the border area after the shelling ends, acccording to officials of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Border Relief Operation and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The officials repeatedly have asked Thai authorities for access to refugees who may have been wounded in the gunfire. <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowman </PERSON>, president of the agency <ORGANIZATION> Refugees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government should urge the Thai government to restrain the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. The Thai military has so far cooperated with the guerrillas. `` We should encourage the Thais, though, to increasingly press for greater access to those camps to ensure the people are treated in a humanitarian way, not carried into <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> or forced to serve the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> against their will,'' <PERSON> Lowman </PERSON> said. Relief officials said most of the shelling now appears to have shifted to the area around <PERSON> Borai </PERSON>, a Khmer Rouge-run camp of 5,500 refugees not far north of Ta <PERSON> Luan </PERSON>. Sporadic shelling also continued along the northern Thai-Cambodian border, where the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> moved 5,000 or more refugees from another U.N.-assisted camp, <LOCATION> O'Trao </LOCATION>, located in the northeastern <LOCATION> Sisaket </LOCATION> province. Officials said the guerrillas moved the refugees to at least four border locations from which they were planning to move them to <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> territory as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> carries out the withdrawal of an estimated 120,000 troops. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> slaughtered hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1975-78. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which provides humanitarian aid to the more than 300,000 Cambodian refugees stationed at the Thai border camps, said they believe the 7,000 Cambodians alleged to have disappeared were marched into the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> interior transporting arms to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. About 70,000 Cambodian refugees live in Khmer Rouge-controlled camps but their fate is largely unknown; the guerrillas generally refuse access to outsiders.

 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s radio address Saturday. My fellow Americans, there's a meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> next week I'm looking forward to I'll be getting together next Wednesday on Governors Island with the leader of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, Chairman <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. This will be our last such meeting, and I must admit that I would not have predicted after first taking office that someday I would be waxing nostalgic about my meetings with Soviet leaders. But here we are, for the fifth time Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and I together in the hope of further peace. And always in my mind I go back to that first summit held in 1985 at a private villa on the shores of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. At the first of our fireside talks, I said to Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that ours was a unique meeting between two people who had the power to start World War III or to begin a new era for humanity. The opportunity for such a new era is there, and very real. That is n't to say, of course, that that era is already upon us. No, too many fundamental differences on matters such as human rights and regional tensions remain unsettled between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. But it is to say that there is the hope of an era in which the terrible nightmares of the post war era, totalitarianism and nuclear terror may diminish significantly and, please God, some day fade away. Throughout the postwar period, this has always been <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s agenda, that the blessings of peace and freedom we know so well in this country will someday belong to every nation, to every people Toward this end, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies have over the last eight years pursued a course of public candor and military strength, but also a course of vigorous diplomatic engagement with the Soviets. And the Soviets have responded. The result has been progress on a wide series of fronts. First and most obvious, we have signed the first treaty in history reducing nuclear armaments _ indeed wiping out a whole class of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet nuclear missiles. So, too, other arms negotiations are moving forward. In purusing this cause, the Soviets must abide by past agreements and in this regard the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar violation remains a significant problem. In the area of regional conflicts, we've seen a partial Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and commitment to full withdrawal by February. In <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mediation has led to a ceasefire and prospects for a political settlement and withdrawal of Cuban troops. In <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, steps have been taken toward a withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, and in other regions we have seen movements toward peace. So, too, in our bilateral relations with the Soviets, there has been movement toward wider exchanges between our two peoples that bring <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Soviet citizens in closer contact and communication. Finally, but most important, in the area of human rights we have also seen progress. Yes, we welcome recent steps like an end to jamming of western broadcasts heard in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but we also are hopeful that talk of Democratic reform and greater freedom or all the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries will become more than just talk. We hope, for example, for a day when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will permit the publication of the works of Solzhenitsyn or the day when the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall will be no more. Yes, we want bold words of reform about political and religious expression to become more than just words. So for all the progress and all the hope, the journey to this final meeting between Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and me at <LOCATION> Governors </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> has been a difficult one, and believe me, the journey toward better Soviet-American relations will remain a difficult one. Yet, it is a journey that must continue beyond any single president or term of office. And that's why I'm particularly delighted that Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be joining Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and me at Governors Island next week. Now I've spoken many times about Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s foreign policy credentials and his long experience in this field. At every stage in the summit process he has been at my side. No one is better versed in the details of Soviet-American relations or has a stronger foreign policy portfolio than our vice president. So while our get-together next week will not be a working summit with a formal agenda, you can be sure I'll be telling Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> represents change, yes, but also continuity; that he stands for firmness and strength and candor in the cause of freedom; that he knows intimately the essentials of the Soviet-American relationship and that the American people do not want treaties for the sake of treaties, they want agreements that endure and help prevent war as the world moves relentlessly toward a new birth of freedom for all humanity. Until next week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

 When <PERSON> Dulal </PERSON> <PERSON> Biswas </PERSON> heard a cyclone was bearing down on his fishing village, he sent his 5-year-old daughter <PERSON> Shanti </PERSON> to her grandparents' home for safety. Many of his friends and fellow boatmen disappeared in the storm Tuesday night, but <PERSON> Biswas </PERSON> survived and gave thanks that <PERSON> Shanti </PERSON>, too, was safe. A few days later, he headed for the place where <PERSON> Shanti </PERSON> had gone, two miles further inland. On the way, he stumbled upon a child's body on the bank of the <LOCATION> Pasur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, one of the more than 1,400 people who perished when the cyclone struck <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> Drawing closer, he peered in disbelief at the bloated, decomposing body. Then he screamed, beat his chest and cried, `` <PERSON> Shanti </PERSON>, my little doll, <PERSON> Shanti </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Biswas </PERSON>, incoherent with grief, could barely relate his story. Most of it was told by a volunteer from the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, the Islamic equivalent of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, who was with the boatman when he found his daughter's body. <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON>, the village elder, said <PERSON> Biswas </PERSON>' wife died a year ago of cholera and <PERSON> Shanti </PERSON> was his only child. <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> said six people died in <LOCATION> Shoron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Khola </LOCATION> when the cyclone struck, leveling most of the straw-and-mud houses in the village of 160 people. But he said many people, perhaps dozens, had set out in their boats to try to escape the cyclone bearing down upon <PERSON> Shoron </PERSON> <PERSON> Khola </PERSON>, which is barely a mile from the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>. `` Those who stayed back and prayed were safe,'' the 55-year-old <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> said. `` Those who dared to take a boat are either dead or missing.'' `` The cyclone came and a wave 10 feet high crashed over the river. The wind howled and uprooted many trees and destroyed many houses,'' the village elder said. In <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, about 1,050 people died in the cyclone, a <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Saturday. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> state, which abuts <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, the official death toll had reached 410 by Saturday. The number of people still missing in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, their fates unknown, ranged from 3,000 to 5,000, according to newspapers in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, the capital. The newspapers estimated between 2.5 million and 5 million people were left homeless by the cyclone that devastated 30 of the country's 64 administrative districts. The actual number of deaths may never be known. Communication is poor in much of the region, and bureaucracy slows the reporting of verifiable deaths in some places. In <LOCATION> Perojpur </LOCATION>, 65 miles northeast of <PERSON> Shoron </PERSON> <PERSON> Khola </PERSON>, local council member <PERSON> Hamiduz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaman </PERSON> claimed the cyclone caused greater property damage than one that killed at least 300,000 people in 1970. That cyclone, which struck a year before <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> won its independence from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in civil war, confined its fury mostly to the coastal region, while the latest storm reached more than 125 miles inland. `` Our latest cyclone did more damage to the standing crops, the infrastructures, dwellings and telecomunications than the one in 1970,'' <PERSON> Zaman </PERSON> said. `` In my subdistrict, only 14 lives were lost -LRB- this time -RRB- but there was colossal damage to the rice crop and the mud-and-straw houses. Many of the people are too poor to build new houses for many months.'' President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, who toured southwestern <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> on Thursday and Friday to visit the sites of greatest devastation, said his government will mobilize its resources to help the people. But the government of this impoverished nation, where the per capita annual income is $ 150 a year, will be hard-pressed to meet the task. Floods during the summer monsoon rains put three-fourths of the country under water, killing 1,500 people and destroying much of the rice crop. Cyclones and monsoon floods strike the low-lying nation with deadly regularity. Most of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> is barely above sea level. Its 110 million people live in the third-most densely populated land in the world, after the city-states of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Bangladeshis live in an average of 2,000 people per square mile. If the present birth rate is not checked, the population will surpass 200 million in the next 35 years. Already, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Officials in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> is one of the world's largest recipients of foreign aid _ $ 2 billion was pledged before the summer floods. The floods, which started in June and peaked in early September, brought additional offers of aid, although much of it was not additional aid but a speeding up of foodstuffs, seed grain and health care materials already in the pipeline for future distribution.

 Just when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> appeared to be patching up an often thorny relationship, the world body and its host country were thrown back onto a collision course by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to ban <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. In an action seen as a slap in the face to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> adminstration, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> voted 154-2 Friday to convene a special session in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> so that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> can address a debate on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Only the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> voted against the measure. In the past, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> officials have accused the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> of anti-Western bias, wastefulness and of running a bloated, inefficient bureaucracy in need of reform. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in dues to express its displeasure. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> frequently was denounced as imperialistic by developing nations, which dominate the 159-nation <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. In recent years, civility, cooperation and equilibrium had been restored. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> praised the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and its peacemaking efforts in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and in the Iran-Iraq war, and noted its potential for peacekeeping in regions such as <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> delivered his final presidential speech to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in September, he was well-received. Now, some fear the reconciliation is in jeopardy. `` Does this spell the end of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>?'' wrote Undersecretary-General <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Verner </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, the highest ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> who was deeply distressed by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> denial of a visa to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. The move, <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> wrote in a letter to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, has `` done incalculable damage to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> credibility in the world arena.'' In denying a visa to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was an `` accessory'' to acts of terror by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders and most of the international community opposed the move. They said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is obliged, under the 1947 Headquarters Agreement, to grant visas to all <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomats and invitees on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> business. Arab diplomats said the rejection of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s visa application was an insult to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is the last hurrah of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and has eroded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> credibility with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations,'' said <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON>, ambassador of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. But he added that `` We do not think it will do lasting damage. `` We fully expect the new administration of President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be more pragmatic and less ideologically obsessive than its predecessor. We expect the new administration to take stock of this unfortunate episode, learn from the international outrage that it has generated and move constructively.'' Before the <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> problem, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was involved in another international uproar this year over its efforts to close the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>. A district court judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ruled the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move was illegal. The episode soured U.S.-U.N. relations. Most Arab nations wanted to move the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, in protest, and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was trying to stifle the voice of the Palestinian people. Apart from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> problem, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been estranged from the world body because its total outstanding dues now are more than $ 400 milion as a result of the money withheld to protest <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> policies. In September, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration announced it would pay some back dues and make arrangements to pay the outstanding balance.

 Hundreds of rock-throwing demonstrators tried to storm the closed Union Carbide pesticide plant Saturday on the fourth anniversary of the gas leak that killed more than 3,300 people, but police blocked the charge. Police said they arrested at least 200 of the protesters. Organizers of the demonstration said about 500 were arrested. Most in the crowd were residents of shantytowns across the road from the plant. Many said they still suffered from the effects of the toxic methyl isocyanate that leaked out of a storage tank and turned into a killer white cloud at about 1 a.m. on Dec. 3, 1984. The crowd shouted `` We want justice'' and `` Hang <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> president who resigned after the gas leak. A few demonstrators suffered minor injuries as they scuffled with police wielding steel-tipped bamboo canes. There were no signs of injuries to the police. Reporters estimated the size of the crowd at 1,000 and the number of uniformed police at 500. Dozens of plainclothes policemen also were seen moving among the demonstrators. Five activists from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>, chief organizer of the demonstration, scaled the 8-foot walls surrounding the pesticide plant, which closed after the gas leak and never re-opened. Plainclothes police behind the wall grabbed four of the men, but the fifth ran to a watchtower and hoisted the red flag of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Both the man and the banner were quickly pulled down. Police sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the demonstrators would be released soon without charge. Indian law permits police to hold detainees up to 90 days without charge. Demonstrators usually are held for a few hours or overnight before being freed. The government of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> filed a $ 3 billion damage suit against the <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, Conn.-based company in 1986, but the case is still tied up in Indian courts. Last year, on the third anniversary of the gas leak, the government filed murder charges against <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and abroad. None of the officials has responded to the summonses, and government prosecutors have said they will try to extradite <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has accused <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>, whose Indian subsidiary operated the plant, of negligence resulting in the gas leak. The company says the leak was the result of sabotage by a disgruntled employee. At least two dozen effigies representing <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> were set ablaze near the derelict plant Friday and Saturday. According to the <LOCATION> Madhya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> government, 3,329 people have died from the gas and 20,000 survivors still suffer from its effects. Gas Relief Commissioner <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sathyam </PERSON>, a state official whose department records gas deaths and administers relief, said the victims are still dying at a rate of about one a day.

 Peace talks between <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> were suspended today after negotiations bogged down over how to verify the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, South African officials said. The talks were the latest round in U.S.-mediated efforts to end hostilities between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and to achieve independence for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The spokesman for the South African negotiators, <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Darroll </PERSON>, said the South African, Angolan and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> delegations needed to consult with their governments `` on essential questions which have not been resolved.'' The negotiators had hoped to sign an interim treaty Saturday evening or Sunday. A formal treaty was to follow at a ceremony in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and government-run television also reported the South African delegation was returning home. The news agency quoted Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as saying he was confident an agreement could be signed sometime this month, but his delegation had to consult with President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> about proposals made on the issue of verification of Cuban troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The television report, as well as an earlier report on goverment-run radio, said <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> would hold talks tonight with a high-ranking Soviet foreign affairs official to work out snags in the agreement. There was no report about whether those talks had taken place, but South African television said the Soviet official, Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Anatoli </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamishin </PERSON>, was staying in the same hotel where the talks were taking place. Such talks would be the first in decades between such high-ranking officials from the two countries in a publicly-acknowledged setting. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have not met formally since 1956, when the Soviets broke diplomatic ties over <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of apartheid There have been frequent reports in the last two years of lower-level contacts between the two nations to end longtime conflicts in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The Soviets, though not a party to the peace talks, have usually had a delegation on hand to give advice to their allies, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> briefly left the <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION> talks today to cross the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and deliver a message to <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON>. Before departing, he told reporters the results of the talks will depend on the attitude of the Cubans and Angolans. An Angolan official, who declined to be further identified, said his delegation still hoped `` for a happy ending.'' The talks are aimed at achieving withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops who are supporting the Marxist Angolan government in its civil war against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> - and South African-backed guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> A Cuban withdrawal is expected to lead to South African withdrawal from <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s southern neighbor. South African officials say agreement has been blocked by a disagreement over verification of the Cuban withdrawal. <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> has been insisting that it be allowed to participate in monitoring the pullout, but <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> have refused, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can monitor the withdrawal and report to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Government-controlled South African radio said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> negotiator <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, was pressing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to accept <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monitoring of the withdrawal.

<HEAD>Atlantis Astronauts Continue Top-Secret Mission</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> disclosed nothing but the lunch menu Saturday as astronauts aboard space shuttle Atlantis reportedly deployed a top-secret spy satellite that can peer down at the Soviets through clouds and darkness. The public space-to-ground radio link was kept silent while the five military men went about their business on the second day of the mission, which began with Friday's launch and is under the control of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said in advance it would break the silence only if major problems developed aboard the spacecraft. By all accounts, Saturday was to have been the crew's busiest day, with the expected release of the $ 500 million Lacrosse satellite, but the only official word on the mission came from <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, which released the menu: salmon, ham, macaroni and cheese and turkey tetrazzini. Sources have said the satellite is capable of recording sharp images of military targets in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION>. Weighing 18 tons and with a solar panel wingspan of 150 feet, the satellite, according to sources, will help verify Soviet compliance with arms treaties and serve as a `` radar eye'' for the stealth bomber. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>' apparently knows plenty about the satellite, reporting many details about it, including the code name Lacrosse. Atlantis' secret mission began with a spectacular public blastoff from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, during a momentary calm in fierce, upper-level winds similar to those that halted the launch on Thursday. Four hours after the shuttle blazed across the clear sky on a northward course, <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> broke the silence, saying: `` The crew of <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION> is go for orbit operations.'' That announcement meant that the spaceship's cargo bay doors were open and the task of preparing the satellite for deployment could begin. Only military men are aboard <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION>, serving under <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, the commander. The pilot is Air Force Lt. Col. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, and the mission specialists are Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullane </PERSON> and Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>. According to pre-flight reports, <PERSON> Mullane </PERSON> was to be inside the shuttle cabin using the orbiter's robot arm to hoist the satellite out of the cargo bay and release it when <PERSON> Atlantis </PERSON> was in a precise location and position. The procedure was so intricate that <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> were to be in space-walking suits, prepared to go into the cargo bay if any problems arose in releasing the satellite. Normally, astronauts do not suit up for satellite launches. Once Lacrosse is in orbit 240 miles high, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> then were to fly alongside the satellite until ground controllers were certain it was working properly. The satellite's course reportedly will often take it over the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where it can observe military operations through darkness and cloud cover. The crew also planned to conduct several experiments aimed at defining the role of military observers in space, with reconnaisance a high priority, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. It is believed the astronauts will test a special optical device resembling hand-held binoculars. The tests will be coordinated with undisclosed ground exercises that could include troop maneuvers, naval movements or ballistic missile launches. The flight, the second since the Challenger disaster, the 27th shuttle mission overall and the third dedicated to the military, is expected to end Monday or Tuesday with the landing at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plan to give 24-hour notice of the landing.

 The government announced Saturday it will impose fees for medical services for the first time in more than 50 years. The army daily <PERSON> Al-Qaddissiya </PERSON> said the new fees, approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, took effect Thursday. They will cover all kinds of services ranging from basic examinations to surgery at state hospitals. The fee for a basic examination will be the equivalent of 60 cents, an X-ray about $ 1.60 and a baby delivery $ 3.20. Public medical service in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has been free since it was started in 1923. The new system is part of an effort by <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to recoup heavy economic losses stemming from its 8-year conflict with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The government borrowed up to $ 80 billion to fund the war. A cease-fire began Aug. 20. The new medical fees also were seen as an attempt to cut down on the number of people visiting doctors who are not truly sick.

 Authorities declared former ruler <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Meza </PERSON> a fugitive Saturday after he missed a congressional hearing to testify on the theft of revolutionary <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> `` Che'' <PERSON> Guevara </PERSON>'s diary. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Meza </PERSON>, who has been under house arrest while facing trial for theft and other charges, was to appear before the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sucre </LOCATION>, 325 miles southeast of the capital. The panel has accused <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Meza </PERSON>, a former army major general, of stealing the diary of <PERSON> Guevara </PERSON> from a military safe and selling it overseas. The diary covered <PERSON> Guevara </PERSON>'s guerrilla activities up to his death in 1967 in the hands of <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> military. The commission ordered his arrest when he failed to show up to a Friday hearing. At a second hearing on Saturday his lawyer, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Salamanca </PERSON>, said in a statement that <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Meza </PERSON> refused to attend and that the commission had no right to order his arrest. Col. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ugarte </PERSON>, police commander in <LOCATION> Sucre </LOCATION>, told a local radio station Saturday that his agents are searching for <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Meza </PERSON> and have declared him a fugitive. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Meza </PERSON> took over the government in 1980 after a bloody military coup and ruled <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> until 1981 when military officers removed him from office. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ordered his house arrest while trying him on charges of human rights violations and theft between 1980 and 1981. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Meza </PERSON>'s administration was also accused by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other governments of involvement in cocaine trafficking. <PERSON> Guevara </PERSON>'s diary was offered for sale by <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s auction house in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> three years ago but the sale was suspended after the <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> government filed legal briefs saying the diaries were the property of the Bolivian government. <PERSON> Guevara </PERSON>, a Communist doctor from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, helped lead the Cuban revolution in 1959 and supported leftist guerrilla movements worldwide. He later broke with Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and was among rural revolutionaries hoping to overthrow <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s government when he was killed.

 Israeli troops fatally shot a Palestinian teen-ager and wounded at least 15 others Saturday in clashes in the occupied territories that prompted curfews in three <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> towns. The army also barred reporters from <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, in response to the unrest The 16-year-old Palestinian was killed in the village of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Furid </LOCATION>, about four miles east of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, when troops opened fire on demonstrators who erected stone barricades and hurled rocks and bottles at soldiers, the army said. The boy, whose name was not immediately released, died of bullet wounds to the neck and chest at <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials said. His death raised to at least 318 the number of Arabs killed since the start of the nearly yearlong <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military rule of the occupied territories. Eleven Israelis also have died. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> during the 1967 Middle East War. Hospital officials said 20 Palestinians were wounded in the Saturday clashes in the territories.

<HEAD>Commissioner Kills Staff Draft That Sparked Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Social Security Commissioner <PERSON> Dorcas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, faced with an outcry over possible changes in disability rules, said Saturday she has rejected the draft proposal that sparked the furor. She said the draft had `` generated inaccurate information and caused undue alarm to the American public.'' She said she remains convinced that the agency's hearings and appeals process needs reform, but the staff-suggested proposal did not meet her criteria of making the system `` more equitable, compassionate and efficient.'' `` I believe that <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- can do better and have, therefore, rejected it,'' she said in a four-page statement. The furor erupted last month when The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was considering restricting the right of Social Security applicants to introduce new evidence upon appeal. Thirty-five senators, including one Republican, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenburger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, sent a letter to President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday urging him to repudiate the policy change. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, in her statement, said her agency `` is deeply committed to improving the hearings and appeals process to ensure that claimants receive fair, timely and accurate decisions when appealing an unfavorable government decision.' She said it was important to ensure that the system is compassionate, since most appeals involve disability claims. She said people are also entitled to `` a speedy decision.'' The agency gets 300,000 requests a year for hearings before its 800 administrative law judges, and it takes an average of nearly two years to appeal a claim through the administrative process to the federal courts. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said 80 percent of Social Security beneficiaries now are represented at these hearings by lawyers, and the agency each year `` pays almost $ 100 million in fees to attorneys out of the past due benefits of claimants who win benefits on appeal.'' More than half those who appeal disability denials eventually win benefits. The proposal drafted by the agency's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hearings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> would have required claimants to submit all evidence at least seven days in advance of a hearing before an administrative law judge. Social Security officials said the draft had not even reached <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>'s desk when it became public. It proved an acute embarrassment for <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, often mentioned as a contender for secretary of health and human services in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. She said that `` because confidence in our policy-making process has been questioned, I removed the draft proposal from the routine process and personally reviewed it.'' Disability benefit cutoffs were a major source of controversy in the early years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, when more than 1 million disability beneficiaries had their cases reviewed and more than 40 percent were ordered off the rolls. More than half won on appeal, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration eased up on the reviews. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> was not commissioner then. In her statement, <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said, `` There is nearly unanimous agreement that the current hearings and appeals process needs reform. In addition to our own concerns, a vast amount of criticism has also come from frustrated claimants, attorneys, the courts and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' To improve it, she said, `` we need an open and honest exchange of ideas. We must explore all options and alternatives.'' She said she has asked her Disability Review Council, chaired by Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Affeldt </PERSON>, to review the hearings and appeals process. She also invited leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and `` all interested parties'' to work together with her to make the process `` fairer, more equitable and more responsive to the needs of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public.''

 Communist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> sends its first ambassador Monday, clearing the way for opening full diplomatic relations with staunchly anti-communist <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. Ministry spokesman <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hang-kyung </PERSON> said Ambassador <PERSON> Sandor </PERSON> <PERSON> Etre </PERSON> will arrive Monday to head his country's four-member mission. Etre, 47, served as <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s envoy to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1979-84. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> became the first communist nation to open such a mission in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> shortly before the 1988 Summer Olympics opened in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Sept. 17. The two countries, in announcing the decision, said they will continue negotiations to open full diplomatic relations as soon as possible. Following the announcement, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> set up its first mission in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> in December last year. The decision stirred a diplomatic row between <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s archrival, communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> strongly indicated it would sever relations with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> goes ahead with the decision.

 Chinese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> said Saturday that his Soviet counterpart will travel to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for more discussions before the officials of the world's two largest communist nations meet next year. Qian set no date or place for what would be a historic encounter between President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and senior <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xioping </PERSON>. Their nations have been estranged for three decades. `` Both sides agree believe it is important to hold such a meeting,'' <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> told reporters at the conclusion of his three-day visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for meetings with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. However, `` there are some outstanding issues which necessitate further discussion,'' <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said. `` For that reason, I have invited my counterpart Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> early next year to continue our discussions.'' <PERSON> Qian </PERSON>, who left for home Saturday night, called the disagreement between his country and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> `` a hot potato'' to be resolved before their planned summit. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> wants the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to persuade <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to withdraw its estimated 120,000 troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, where they have been fighting Chinese-backed guerrillas for the past decade. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has committed itself to the withdrawal of 50,000 of its forces by the end of this year and its remaining troops by 1990. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> on Friday he believed <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is showing `` a constructive spirit'' toward resolving the dispute, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is ready to negotiate directly with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> over the Cambodian dispute, but he added that some Vietnamese think <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> `` is a dice to play'' in a game. `` We think it is not a dice but a hot potato. We think it is better to throw out the hot potato.'' Progress also has emerged on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s two other requirements for improved relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Ongoing negotiations have settled disputes over parts of the 2,600-mile border between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. On another issue, half of the Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> have been withdrawn. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to help the government fight the anti-communist rebels. Under <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords signed April 14 by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the Soviets are to withdraw all of their military units by Feb. 15. However, the Soviets have threatened to disregard the Feb. 15 deadline if rebel fighting escalates. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> discussed the Afghan issue with Qian Friday but gave no details. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was the first by a high-ranking <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> official in 31 years. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were allies in the 1950s, but relations soured over the direction of the world communist movement. The tension peaked in 1969, when the two nations fought a brief frontier war. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> told reporters Saturday that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would like to normalize relations `` on the basis of peace and coexistence,'' but without the close ties that once bound the two nations. `` It is necessary not to go back to the period of the 1950s, but it is also necessary not to return to confrontation,'' he said. During his 1-hour-40-minute meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and more than six hours of meetings with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said the subjects discussed also included border trade and joint exploration of the Soviet Far East, as well as `` joint use of the labor force.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s president said Saturday he will dissolve <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Dec. 20, a day after presidential elections, to give his successor `` the benefit of the views of the present electorate.'' President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> also said he would call general elections six months ahead of schedule, on Feb. 15 instead of the scheduled balloting next August. He said new legislators would begin their six-year terms March 9. Opposition parties and the powerful <PERSON> Buddhist </PERSON> clergy have urged <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> to disband <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> before the presidential elections in an effort to end the ethnic civil war that has wracked this <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island since 1983. Nearly 10,000 people have died in the fighting. But <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> has resisted their calls, saying he would dissolve <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> after his successor is chosen. `` I feel that an opportunity should be given to the people to elect a new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> so that the new president should have the benefit of the views of the present electorate,'' the 82-year-old leader said in a speech broadcast on state-run radio and television. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, who is ending a political career that spans 45 years, is prohibited by law from seeking a third six-year term. He and his <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have been in power since 1977, extending their terms through a 1982 referendum rather than a general election. A Sinhalese extremist group, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, has called for the nation's estimated 9.3 million eligible voters to boycott the presidential race, charging <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s government is incapable of conducting a fair election. The front, a shadowy group known more for its violent acts than its Marxist ideology, opposes a peace accord aimed at ending the 5-year-old insurgency by Tamil militants fighting for a separate homeland in the north and east provinces. It also wants an estimated 47,000 Indian peacekeeping troops trying to supervise the accord withdrawn from the island. Sinhalese extremists contend the accord grants too many concessions to the Tamils, who are mostly Hindu and comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. The predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the population and control the government and the military. The front has vowed to kill anyone who supports the accord and has been blamed for more than 900 political murders since the pact was signed in July 1987. Most of the victims have been government supporters. Earlier Saturday, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lankan </LOCATION> soldiers hunting for Sinhalese rebels conducted a house-to-house search in the <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Panadura </LOCATION> after imposing a 22-hour curfew, which expires early Sunday. More than 100 suspects were taken into custody, but most were released, according to a military official, who can not be identified under briefing rules. The operation was called after authorities received information that front members planned to launch a nationwide strike next week in an effort to destablize the government. In his speech Saturday night, <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> said political unrest had hampered implementation of many of his government's programs. However, he told listeners: `` I value especially whatever I have been able to do to preserve the rights of my people to elect their representatives, to point out their mistakes and to replace them through elections, thus preserving the fundamental freedoms of democracy.''

 President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> on Saturday refused to negotiate with hundreds of rebel soliders holed up at a giant army base and surrounded by loyal troops and tanks. Returning from a three-day trip to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> immediately met with top military aides and his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> `` and gave instructions to re-establish discipline and order where it has been broken,'' spokesman <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said.

The majority leader of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaroslavsky </PERSON>, who attended the meeting, told reporters later that Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Caridi </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> whether his instructions meant `` that I must fight.'' `` The president answered: ` Do what you must do,''' <PERSON> Jaroslavsky </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Caridi </PERSON> summoned army commanders to <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> for a meeting. Political, labor and civic leaders throughout the country urged the government to use a firm hand in ending the two-day rebellion, the third faced by <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> since his election in 1983 to replace a nearly eight-year military government. `` All the weight of the law must be brought to bear against those who rise up with the arms the people gave them to defend the constitution,'' said <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>, the presidential candidate for <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in elections set for next May. At the giant <ORGANIZATION> Campo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> base on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, an estimated 450 rebels, armed with machine guns and automatic weapons and led by Col. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON>, 54, remained in control of an infantry school. Loyal troops, who fired several volleys of mortar shells at the rebels on Friday, surrounded the school, supported by at least 16 medium tanks and armored personnel carriers. Although the army provided no figures on the number of troops present, witnesses said loyal troops surrounding the infantry school and in the base area appeared to number between 3,000 and 4,000. The army said in a communique that four military men were wounded in exchanges of fire Friday, including a first lieutenant who was listed in critical condition, a captain and two noncommissioned officers. The army did not say to which band they belonged. Earlier, news agencies had reported that the first lieutenant was killed. Local press reports indicated Friday night that a 19-year-old woman walking on the base was wounded by gunfire. Vice President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> announced Friday night that the uprising `` had been overcome,'' but spokesmen for the rebels quickly disputed that claim early Saturday. Roman Catholic Priest <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jardin </PERSON>, who claimed to be a `` personal friend'' of <LOCATION> Seineldin </LOCATION>, left the infantry school early Saturday and was quoted by the private news agency <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Argentinas </ORGANIZATION> as saying that `` a truce of several days'' had been agreed on by the rebels and <PERSON> Caridi </PERSON>. `` Seineldin has not surrendered nor does he intend to,'' said <PERSON> Jardin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON>, a combat veteran of the 1982 <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> War with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, told reporters Friday he and his men did not want to overturn the government, but sought to `` restore military honor to the army and review the trials that punish the just and promote the guilty.'' A radio station in the northern province of Corrientes claimed to have obtained a proclamation from rebel supporters which spelled out demands. The rebels, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Provincia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrientes </ORGANIZATION> said, seek replacement of the current general staff and an immediate end to trials of military men accused of human rights abuses in a 1970s war against leftist subversives. At least 9,000 Argentines `` disappeared'' during that time and are presumed dead. The station also said the rebels sought special budget treatment for the armed forces. Army spending has been drastically slashed by a government plagued by deficit spending, triple-digit annual inflation and a $ 56 billion foreign debt.

 The government strongly criticized <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> on Saturday for closing the <ORGANIZATION> Yugoslav </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> and expelling its staff, the state news agency said. But <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> did not threaten to retaliate. Assistant Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Drago </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirosic </PERSON> made the protest to Australian Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, who was summoned to the Foreign Secretariat. The Foreign Secretariat `` most energetically protested'' the Australian decision and `` expressed surprise and embitterment'' over what was described as <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s `` unilateral and unfounded decision,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> on Friday shut the Yugoslav Consulate and ordered the staff of 12 expelled following a diplomatic row over <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s refusal to surrender a security guard accused of shooting a demonstrator The Australian government had given the consulate 24 hours to turn over the guard. When the deadline passed Friday, its foreign minister, <PERSON> Gareth </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, gave the staff and their dependents 72 hours to leave the country. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said his government reserved the right to claim compensation from <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> officials for the family of <PERSON> Jospeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tokic </PERSON>, 16, who was shot in the throat during a protest outside the consulate Sunday, Yugoslav National Day. Yugoslav authorities said the guard, identified as <PERSON> Matijas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoran </PERSON>, fired in self-defense when several Croatian youths began scaling the consulate walls. Croatians are among several ethnic groups in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. About 200,000 Yugoslavs live in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> quoted the Yugoslav protest as saying: `` The decision of the Australian authorities represents an act which is inadequate to the character and level of the entire relations between <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and inflicts harm to the preservation and further development of the relations between the two countries.'' It expressed `` regret that the proposal of the Federal Secretary was not accepted -LRB- for <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> -RRB- to abandon ultimatum demands ... -LRB- and -RRB- make possible through direct talks ... that a mutually acceptable solution be found.'' <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> also noted that no information had been received about measures Australian authorities took to prevent further activity of `` pro-fascist emigres in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, directed against <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and its official representatives, as well as against the development of stable relations between the two countries,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> emphasized that the responsibility for the current situation in the two countries' relations rests with <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. It said it `` reserves the right to take appropriate measures to protect Yugoslav interests and dignity,'' but did not threaten to retaliate against <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> for closing the consulate.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> leaders vowed Saturday to forge ahead with plans for a single-market <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> by 1992 and reassured the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> they will remain faithful to free trade. At the end of a two-day summit on this Greek island, the 12 leaders said in a statement that a unified European market will benefit `` community and non-community countries alike.'' But they acknowledged that proposed changes _ including uniform value-added taxes, opposed by <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> _ resulted in disputes that were causing their single-market plan to lose momentum. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told reporters it was `` absolutely absurd'' to install such taxes after 1992, since the varying tax rates in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> will automatically steer consumers to the best bargains. `` I think the market will deal with any changes that need to be made,'' she told reporters. French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> stood firm on the need to harmonize taxes in the years ahead. However, West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> states agreed their 1992 single market project was `` irreversible.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> summit sought to allay <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese fears that after 1992 their exports will be shut out of the lucrative market of 322 million West Europeans. In their statement, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders said: `` The internal market will not close in on itself ... -LRB- It -RRB- will be a decisive factor contributig to greater liberalization of international trade.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> annually export goods to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> respectively worth about $ 66 billion and $ 42 billion to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, or more than 25 percent of the community's imports. In their final statement, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders said abolishing internal <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> borders for travelers must go hand-in-hand with closer cooperation among police forces to combat terrorism, international crime and drug smuggling. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has expressed fears that a frontier-free <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will attract terrorists and international criminals, including members of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has units operating in continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders also reaffirmed their guarded support for a Nov. 15 declaration of an independent Palestinian state by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament in exile. The council, which met in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, also endorsed a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution that implicitly recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. On Nov. 21, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> welcomed the declaration, but stopped short of recognizing an independent <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders agreed to send their <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassadors to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for a planned <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session to be addressed by <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, French Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> said. The New York-based assembly is to meet in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has refused to issue <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> wanted to send the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> blocked the move. As a result, 11 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders agreed to send their <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassadors to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> session. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, however, will send Foreign Minister <PERSON> Carolos </PERSON> <PERSON> Papoulias </PERSON>. The 12 EEC nations are: <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will meet Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for the fifth time on Wednesday, closing out a relationship that has evolved from open hostility to the old-shoe clubbiness of rivals drawn by shared personalities. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who spurned superpower summitry throughout his first term, is likely to accord his Soviet guest in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the sort of personal adieu extended to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, a remarkable finale to a rollercoaster tete-a-tete that survived the icy gusts of <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> to transform national policies and nuclear arsenals in just three years. Some would argue nothing has been transformed more than the attitude of the president, the longtime cold warrior who made rebuilding the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military his first priority. Others say the U.S.-Soviet breakthroughs are more naturally the consequence of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s dynamic emergence from a confusing period of leadership changes and stagnation at the Kremlin. `` I must admit, that I would not have predicted after first taking office, that some day I would be waxing nostalgic about my meetings with Soviet leaders,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Saturday in his weekly radio address. `` But here we are, for the fifth time, Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and I together, in the hope of furthering peace.'' Wherever the credit lies, the Reagan-Gorbachev relationship has moved from unbridled suspicion, to grudging respect, to that Gentleman's Club of Two, where, according to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, `` there is never a sense of personal animus when the arguments are over.'' And now, at a luncheon at <LOCATION> Governors </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will present <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as his membership heir in that most elite club. In his radio speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made a point of pushing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toward center stage. `` No one is better versed in the details of Soviet-American relations or has a stronger foreign policy portfolio than our vice president,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The president said he will tell <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` stands for firmness of strength and candor in the cause of freedom,'' and that the `` American people do not want treateies for the sake of treaties, they want agreements that endure and prevent war.'' `` So, on our get-together next week ... you can be sure I'll be telling Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> represents change, yes, but also continuity,'' the president said. While the administration has gone out of its way to discourage the notion that the meeting amounts to another summit, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has said `` there will be lots of substantive discussion,'' adding that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials would welcome `` forthcoming statements'' by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on troop imbalances in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. Since their initial face-off in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in November 1985, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, 77, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, 56, have held three summits, including the memorable meeting in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, when the two leaders actually discussed a deal to wipe all nuclear weapons from their arsenals, only to witness the bitter collapse of their entire agenda. <PERSON> Spurgeon </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeny </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a private group focusing on nuclear arms issues, credits the flexibility and the personal warmth of both men for the turnaround. `` There's been a real change in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s attitude toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and there's no question that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is an unprecedented personality and a major force in Russian history,'' <PERSON> Keeny </PERSON> said. `` It's to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s credit that he recognizes this and has shown flexibility in his attitude.'' <PERSON> Keeny </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stopped talking of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as an `` evil empire'' just as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` certainly seems to have avoided any negative comments or demeaning statements about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on a personal basis.'' But dealings between the two men have, at times, been very testy, and each has on occasion stood his ground. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, who had a good view as White House chief of staff at both <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, said after the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> summit that one meeting went awry when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> raised the issue of Soviet adventurism around the world. `` There was a very fast -LRB- discussion -RRB-, faster than almost a pingpong match, with remarks going back and forth from one side to the other, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> demanding answers from the president, the president sitting back calmly, saying, ` I am answering you. If you will just wait, you'll get your answer,''' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> repeatedly slapped the table with the palm of his hand and then pointed his finger at <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and asked: `` Who is threatening whom?'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying later, `` I do n't think in many instances of this kind we erased the other fellow's belief There was a similar incident at the close of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit early last June, when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> tried to get <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to accept some language in the final communique about `` peaceful coexistence,'' which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials viewed with suspicion. Then-White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters that `` as the meeting ended, all of us stood up, including the president and the general secretary, and the president and general secretary continued to pursue their conversation.'' `` They were going at it pretty heavy and I was proud of the president,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> thought the language was too vague, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> relented. Just before the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told interviewers from foreign newspapers and television networks that he considered <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a friend as well as an adversary. `` We can debate and we disagree. But there is never a sense of personal animus when the arguments are over.'' While <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has challenged <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to prove that his glasnost campaign of openness is genuine, he also has said that the West should encourage the move toward change in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnenfeldt </PERSON>, an associate fellow at the liberal-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank, said `` I think, from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s standpoint, that this whole glasnost and perestroika concept came to mean ... that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was beginning to see the light'' about failings in Soviet system.

 A satellite rocket stage being readied for the next space shuttle launch in February was badly damaged when a worker bumped into it and will have to be replaced, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> announced Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Diller </PERSON> said officials are assessing `` what impact if any this incident might have on the planned Feb. 18 launch.'' The stage is needed to boost a communications satellite to a high orbit once the astronauts have released it from Discovery's cargo bay. <PERSON> Diller </PERSON> said the worker bumped into the first stage nozzle and cracked it during pre-launch checks Thursday. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> have decided to replace the first stage with a spare motor already available at the launch site,'' a space agency statement said. Testing was to have begun Dec. 10 on the combined first and second stages of the two-stage booster, <PERSON> Diller </PERSON> said. The tests will be delayed until about Dec. 27, he said, and technicians probably would have to work two shifts a day seven days a week to maintain the launch schedule. `` On paper, this plan seems to work,'' <PERSON> Diller </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> on Saturday expelled an American, two West Germans and an Austrian after trying to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s wife, a human rights group reported.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said Saturday that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' decision to move a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> meeting to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> was `` a regrettable action.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, commented in an interview a day after the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> voted to move the session to permit <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, to speak to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Soviet Leaders Trip May Divert Attention From Domestic Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sets out this week on a trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> that will grab headlines around the world and may distract some attention from his problems at home. The Soviet leader is juggling ethnic violence in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, nationalist fever in the Baltic republics to the north and a pervasive sense that food and other essentials are becoming more difficult to find despite his promise that perestroika will make life better. The fires he is trying to control are breaking out at least in part because his new tolerance for dissent permits the fanning of long-smoldering embers without the harsh police-state crackdowns that would have been inevitable here only a few years ago. At the same time, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is moving ahead with the overhaul of the political system that he insists is needed in order to institutionalize democracy and block the bureaucracy from sliding back into stagnation. Some Western diplomats have suggested the Soviet president's travels are aimed at bolstering his image as a world leader at a time when chronic food shortages and public opposition raise questions about the success of his administration at home But both Soviet and Western analysts agree the trip is likely to buttress his efforts to integrate the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into the world community and advance the improvement in East-West relations. That, they say, is the first step on a long road toward reordering domestic priorities in order to divert huge sums now allocated to defense and military aid and direct them toward improving the quality and availability of goods and services at home. `` It's reasonable to think that part of the motivation for the trip is to polish his image as a leader and effective statesman abroad,'' said one Western diplomat who studies Soviet affairs but asked not to be identified. `` The prestige that goes with all of that may help him play a role and could cause a certain distraction from domestic problems that seem so difficult to move or resolve.'' But the Western analyst and a Soviet foreign affairs specialist, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, agreed that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s trip is consistent with his stated goal of pressing for improved relations with the West in order to build and new and better life for his people at home `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> does n't have the resources to sustain the investment it's been making in foreign aid and defense,'' the diplomat said, adding the government `` must apply those resources to domestic problems'' if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform program, which he calls perestroika, or restructuring, is to succeed. The source noted that Western intelligence estimates place Soviet defense spending at 15 percent to 25 percent of the nation's gross national product, which is at least 2.5 times the comparable ratio spent by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Even the lower end of that range would be enormous by world standards,'' the analyst said. `` The upper end would be truly staggering.'' But beyond the numbers, the source added, the military now monopolizes the nation's scientific and technological resources, leaving the rest of Soviet society relatively impoverished and unable to pull itself out of its backwardness. The Soviet source, in a separate interview, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s trip will be aimed largely at dispelling the image many in the West share of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as an enemy. `` We ca n't afford to finance revolution anymore,'' the source said. `` Now we must settle these regional conflicts and develop friendly relations with those who want to see us at the enemy.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> only recently disclosed his plan to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, say farewell to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and greet <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successor, and meet with <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. But he has been extraordinarily active this fall in pressing for improved relations, particularly with <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Since September, he has received leaders from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, has visited <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and on Saturday discussed with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foreign minister the need for a Soviet-Chinese summit within the next six months. `` He's very much a realist,'' one source said, `` and as a realist, he knows he must dispel the ` enemy image' and develop a network of relationships with other countries before he can permit massive reductions in military spending and a reallocation of resources.''

<DATELINE>KARLSRUHE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 11-member leadership of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> resigned Saturday after a no-confidence vote from members seeking a more moderate course. The governing council for the environmentalist party had been dominated by a radical faction that sees little worth in trying to influence government actions by working within the West German parliament. Only 44 of the 519 Bundestag seats are held by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. About 400 Greens delegates gathered during the weekend in <ORGANIZATION> Karlsruhe </ORGANIZATION> for a special party conference, during which a no-confidence vote was proposed. The council and their supporters had been blamed by other factions within the party for `` irregularities'' in the financing of a new party building in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. The no-confidence declaration was approved by a 214 to 186 vote, after which the council resigned. Ousted council member <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said the shakeup may cause the more radical faction to form their own political party. Parliament member and Greens moderate <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Schily </PERSON> said he viewed the departure of the far-left leadership as a chance for the moderates to bring the party closer to the political center. The 39,000-member party had been moving farther left during the past year, a trend that moderates feared could alienate more voters and jeopardize the Greens' continued participation in the Bundestag. Only political parties garnering at least 5 percent of the vote in national elections are allowed to send representatives to the parliament. Greens candidates got 8.3 percent of the vote during the last federal elections in 1987. The party that developed from a radical environmentalist movement in the 1970s formed a national organization in 1979 and first won election to the Bundestag in 1983.

<HEAD>Talks End Without Expected Agreement But Peace Process Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Southern African peace talks ended without an accord Saturday when <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> failed to agree on verification of a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The U.S.-mediated talks were expected to produce an interim accord. South African diplomats cited progress, but some members of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> and Angolan delegations appeared angry. Those members, who declined to be further identified, questioned whether the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> had any intention of negotiating an agreement. A South African spokesman, <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Darroll </PERSON>, said the delegations had to return home for further consultation with their governments `` on essential questions which have not been resolved.'' The main issue remaining is verification of the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, which is scheduled to occur over a 27-month period. South African sources say they demanded representation on the force monitoring the withdrawal, and have declined a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offer to observe and guarantee the pullout. <PERSON> Darroll </PERSON> said the failure to secure an agreement during these talks should not be considered `` a rupture because progress has been recorded. ... We will be returning to <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION> again with the other delegations.'' Although the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> sought to minimize the significance of the failure to reach agreement, as late as Saturday afternoon their Congolese hosts had been predicting an accord would be signed. Ten days ago President <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sassou-Nguesso </PERSON>'s government announced a treaty would be signed Dec. 1. Failure to reach an accord threatens the latest deadline for beginning the independence process for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has said it would like to begin this process, which will be supervised by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, by Jan. 1. However, <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> has insisted the Cuban troops be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, the territory's northern neighbor. The Cubans have helped <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government rebuff South African invasions. The government also is battling the anti-Marxist guerrillas of <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, backed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other nations. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and several African nations have tried to persuade <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to negotiate with <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, saying only reconciliation can bring peace to the former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> has consistently refused to negotiate with <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, who has fought from his guerrilla strongholds since losing a struggle for power following independence from <LOCATION> Portugual </LOCATION> in 1975. In <LOCATION> Walvis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> told a community festival Saturday that the South African port surrounded by the territory of <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will never become part of a future independent <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Walvis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> is the most important harbor on the southwest African coast between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s naval headquarters at <LOCATION> Simonstown </LOCATION> and the Angolan capital of <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>. He said anyone suggesting that it would not remain part of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was talking `` nonsense.''

<HEAD>Soviets and Afghan Guerrillas Hold Direct Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Afghan guerrilla alliance held its first direct talks with Soviet officials since Soviet troops were sent to back the Marxist Afghan government in 1979. The head of the guerrilla delegation said the talks signaled the failure of a U.N.-mediated accord to end the fighting. The talks began in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> resort 600 miles from <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>. The informal meeting is to be followed by formal negotiations beginning later Saturday or Sunday, said sources close to the talks. No details were immediately available about the meeting. The U.N.-mediated <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord signed in April by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> called the Soviets' estimated 100,000 troops backing the Marxist Afghan government to leave by Feb. 15. The first half left by August according to plan, but the Soviets recently halted the pullout to protest continued operations by the guerrillas, who have captured a number of cities. The Saturday meeting began after the arrival of <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, a deputy foreign minister recently named ambassador to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> headed the Soviet delegation. <PERSON> Burhanuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON>, leader of a loose alliance of seven Afghan resistance groups based in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, is the head of the five-member guerrilla delegation. <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON>, in a statement released Saturday in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> asked for the talks. He said his delegation planned to ask the Soviets to withdraw the remaining <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> immediately. `` The direct talks ... will mean the failure of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord,'' <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> - and Pakistan-backed guerrillas were not a part of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON> said the delegation will also ask <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for `` payment of war reparations,'' and `` the urgent removal of mines in the area under Russian occupation.'' In addition the guerrillas want the Soviets to supply maps of mined areas now under rebel control. Members of individual guerrilla groups met with Soviet officials in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> last month and in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, earlier this year to discuss exchanging prisoners of war. This was the first direct meeting with the guerrilla alliance. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, a pro-Western kingdom, was chosen as a venue by the Afghan resistance groups because of the influence it wields in the Islamic world due to its oil wealth and control over <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s two holiest shrines. An official Saudi statement issued late Saturday, distributed by the official Saudi press agency, said that the meeting was arranged `` at the mutual desire'' of the two sides and the aim was `` to discuss issues pending between the two sides to reach a just settlement of the Afghan problem.'' Saudi leaders have tied the establishment of relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to a total pullout of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a Moslem state. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON>, also a Soviet deputy foreign minister, told a press briefing in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Friday that the meeting was arranged by the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> government with the cooperation of the Afghan government. It is aimed at finding `` ways for an internal Afghan settlement,'' he said. However, he added that the meeting was not connected to the international conference on demilitarization. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> seek to convene an international conference to demilitarize the country and set up a coalition government with the guerrillas, who have rejected such a conference.

 A briefing Saturday by the advance team for Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> turned into a display of glasnost when team members disagreed whether the majority of Soviets oppose <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. However, the Soviets could offer no clue to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s schedule of activities this week. The team's chief spokesman, <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Yefimov </PERSON>, a senior ideologist of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, insisted the team had no more information on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit, beginning with his arrival Tuesday, than the reporters they addressed. Last week the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> released a tentative schedule for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but later withdrew it. <PERSON> Yefimov </PERSON> and five other officials even refused to speculate on published reports that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would meet billionaire real estate developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> or visit Wall Street while in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaharov </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Theater, said he would like to see the Broadway play `` A Chorus Line'' to get some tips on how to put on a hit musical. `` Our critics have been telling us that we too seldom put forward any blockbusters. I would like to know whether you have a musical on Broadway that has taken over from ` A Chorus Line,''' said <PERSON> Zaharov </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, love the theater, but he doubted their schedule would leave time for them to attend any Broadway shows. The briefing epitomized <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program for glasnost, or openness, when the two officials disagreed on details of Soviet reforms. <PERSON> Zaharov </PERSON>, a writer and director of the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Theater, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms were not supported by a majority of Soviets. `` In my personal feeling, very many people in our country do n't understand the importance of the processes that are going on in Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s initiative,'' <PERSON> Zaharov </PERSON> said `` I think he has more opponents than supporters. `` I think in our country there is a lot of inertia still prevailing, lack of initiative, and we are reaping the harvest of some very difficult times in our history, and in this regard I am somewhat pessimistic myself,'' he said. <PERSON> Yefimov </PERSON> disagreed. `` I do n't share, I repeat, I do n't entirely share the view of my friend <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaharov </PERSON> when he said that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has more opponents than supporters,'' <PERSON> Yefimov </PERSON> said. `` The forces of inertia are very great, and these forces of inertia and these old habits are part of all of us. Maybe I'm too optimistic, I do n't know, but I can say with an absolutely clear conscience that this -LRB- reform -RRB- machine is moving and is on its way,'' he said.

<HEAD>Moslem Prime Minister Calls Closing of Beirut Crossing `Sabotage'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of the Moslem cabinet in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government said Saturday that the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> decision to close the only crossing linking the divided capital was `` sabotage.'' The closure of the Museum Crossing was ordered Friday by <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to protest harassment by Syrian-backed milities of soldiers moving from west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to the east side. The move has caused food and fuel shortages in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` This is an irresponsible act of sabotage,'' said acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> heads the three-member <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> interim cabinet. A military source said Saturday the real reason behind <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s move was the failure of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, based in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, to pay the November salaries of army personnel stationed in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment. The closure brought the daily truck supplies of flour and fuel from Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to the Moslem sector to a standtill, causing thousands of residents to crowd gas stations and bakeries to stockpile on the commodities. It also was feared that the Christian army command would order a blockade of drinking water. Water tanks, which supply both sides of the capital, are based in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The development aggravates a political crisis that threatens to formalize the nation's de facto partition into two sectarian states. The crisis began when <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> failed to elect a successor to former President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> who, minutes before his term expired on Sept. 22, appointed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to head the interim cabinet. Syrian-backed Moslem leaders rejected <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s appointment, and backed <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s appointment, the Moslems charged, violated an unwritten national covenant dating to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943. Under that pact, the premiership is given to the Sunni Moslem sect, the presidency to the Maronite Christians and the position of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker to a Shiite Moslem.

 High pressure dominated the weather across the nation Saturday and the only precipitation was a few snow showers along a cold front in the upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Strong northwesterly wind was expected to move the snow showers to the lower Great Lakes region and parts of the upper <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> during the night, with up to 6 inches of snow possible in northwestern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Ahead of the cold front, strong southwesterly wind blew across the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and the lower Great Lakes region. Strong northwesterly wind prevailed from the upper <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> to northeastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. A high wind warning was posted in western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. Wind gusted to 55 mph at <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and blew the cover on a police department undercover car. The small sedan was parked in front of police headquarters when the wind caught the driver's side door and ripped it off its hinges, police said. Without a door, the undercover car was pretty conspicuous, acknowledged Chief of Detectives <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alessandra </PERSON>. Dense fog developed in the valleys of the West during the night but largely burned off during the day. Freezing temperatures during the day were primarily confined to the area from eastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> to northwestern <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 10 degrees at <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, to 78 at <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, a once-pretty woman whose face and psyche bear the scars of what she describes as domestic torture, has told of a sorrowful scenario that ended in death for 6-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. On Monday, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, a former editor for <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, will return for a third day as the key prosecution witness in the trial of her former companion, disbarred lawyer <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, who is charged with murdering the illegally adopted child they raised as their own. Her testimony, broadcast live by three local television stations and recounted nationally, has described an 11-year relationship that deteriorated with beatings, brainwashing, food deprivation and other bizarre punishments for imagined transgressions. A 1981 photograph shows a smiling, vivacious, brown-haired, <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> who bears no resemblance to the woman now testifying: gray-haired, with a boxer's nose, a cauliflower ear, a deformed mouth, an injured eye. `` I'm hoping something positive will come out of it: more support, more treatment and more awareness for women and for children,'' said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>, director of clinical services at the Four Winds Hospital in <LOCATION> Katonah </LOCATION>, where Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> has received psychiatric treatment since March. `` It's not something that can be treated with a pill or one or two -LRB- therapy -RRB- sessions. It takes a lot of concerted effort.'' In a slow, deliberate voice, punctuated by pain when she talks about <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46, has told how she came to view <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> as a `` godlike figure'' _ asking his permission to eat, obeying his orders to sleep on the floor or sit in a tub of cold water. Jurors saw handwritten pages in which <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> vowed to care about <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s hair, clothes, work, problems, diet, future, teeth and other concerns. In another paper, she wrote 10 times that `` anger is destructive'' and that `` self-defense is regressive.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> convinced Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> that she had belonged to a sado-masochistic cult, then encouraged her to imagine the details after convincing her she had amnesia, she testified. It was in this climate, the prosecution alleges, that an abused and neglected <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was hurt on the night of Nov. 1, 1987. Hours later, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, smoking cocaine, admitted knocking the child down and said it was because she stared at him, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> died four days later of a brain injury. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was arrested with <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> after the little girl's death, but charges against her were dropped and she agreed to testify against him The prosecution contends that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, who lost her job when she frequently missed work because of injuries and then spent most of her time confined to the family's <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> apartment, was herself too much of a victim to have helped the child. `` I can liken it to being a prisoner of war,'' Ms. <PERSON> Segal </PERSON> said Saturday. The battered spouse syndrome, Ms. <PERSON> Segal </PERSON> said, is `` a process of brainwashing where you end up not really knowing what you think, what you believe, what's right, what's wrong. ... Gradually, there's an erosion of spirit, of will, of judgment. Its victims often are those who `` tend to be a bit timid, possibly fearful of the unknown,'' she said. Testimony showed that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> tried to run away six times. Once, she changed her mind because she feared violent retaliation, she said. Once, a friend's brother told her she was being disloyal to <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>; once, she went to a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> social services agency, where a staff member asked <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> to come get her. `` Generally, what you find is an alliance of sorts: physical or emotional abuse, which is then, almost like a seesaw, balanced by some occasional nurturing,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>. `` For a great many women, if they did leave, where would they go _ especially with children?'' In addition to <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> had another illegally adopoted child, a boy who has since been returned to his natural mother. Ms. <PERSON> Segal </PERSON> said patient confidentiality precluded her discussing specifics of Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s case. `` She's been very courageous and is handling herself beautifully _ that's my personal opinion,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>, adding that she also had told that to Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>. `` I think that now, people may feel a little safer talking about some of this. It might encourage women to seek help, to try to get out of eroding situations in their lives and to know that they're not alone.

 <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> officials beefed up security at airports and power plants in the republics of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> on Saturday and scrambled to aid 150,000 refugees who have fled their homes in fear of ethnic violence, Soviet media reported. The <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> leadership also ripped into the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government leaders of the rival republics for failing to halt the wave of rioting that has killed at least 28 people. Soviet leaders ordered local officials in the republics to work together on a special commission to ease the tension, and assigned several members of the ruling Politburo to assist them. `` Instead of fighting those who instigate disorders, spread all kinds of rumors, and stir up national hatred, there is only dispute about who is more guilty,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Saturday, in reporting on an emergency meeting called Thursday by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> with leaders of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and the disputed territory of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. `` The two republics can not agree on even one action together,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Tanks and Soviet soldiers moved into the two southern republics two weeks ago in attempt to stop the violence, but tensions have not abated. On Friday, official <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> radio reported that troops halted a mob of 1,500 that was attempting to attack Armenian residents of the Azerbaijani capital. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report, carried on the national evening news Saturday, flatly rejected any possibility of altering the borders of the republics in the currently volatile situation. Armenians have been demanding that <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a largely Armenian section of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, be turned over to the Armenian republic. Azerbaijanis and Armenians must work out a joint solution in which `` there should be no winners or losers,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The report also warned that `` tomorrow might be even more tragic'' if nothing is done. The <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> ordered a 24-hour guard on `` power plants, oil and gas fields, pipelines, power lines, and facilities for rail and air transport, communications and water supplies'' in both republics, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> is the center of the Caspian Sea oilfields. Such action was required because `` certain irresponsible elements are trying to put out of action vitally important industrial and transport facilities,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The Council of Ministers also ordered local authorities to being arresting strike organizers and anyone else wreaking havoc with the economy. <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> remained exceptionally tense, as crowds numbering into the hundreds of thousands continued to mass on Lenin Square. Soldiers searched arriving demonstrators for weapons and explosives, said <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> radio, quoting Col. Gen. <PERSON> Tyagunov </PERSON>, military commandant of the city. The radio reports tried to crush rumors that large numbers of Azerbaijanis have been slain or injured in the ethnic disputes with Armenians. In reality, just 17 people had been treated by <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> medical authorities in the past several days even though 78,000 Azerbaijanis have swarmed back to their native republic from <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, the radio reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> confirmed the figure of 78,000 refugees in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The Armenpress news agency in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> said 70,000 Armenians had fled in the opposite direction. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s meeting with political leaders and citizens of the two republics flatly rejected any notion that the strife is solely due to the dispute over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. It admitted serious failures in economic, political and social issues, but added that the issue has become a cover-up for corruption and a struggle for power. The report did not name which Politburo members would be assigned to the commission. However, the Politburo members at Thursday's meeting included Prime Minister <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Slyunkov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, and non-voting members <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyukyanov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Georgi </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Razumovsky </PERSON>

 A sharp earthquake deep beneath City Hall jarred <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> early Saturday, toppling bottles from store shelves, knocking out power to thousands of homes and causing at least 24 minor injuries. The 3:38 a.m. quake registered 5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, said Hall Daily, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>. Several aftershocks were recorded, the largest measuring 2.6. No serious damage was reported. The quake was felt at least 90 miles away, in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. The earth shook across 15,000 square miles and seven counties for about 15 seconds. `` Talk about your rude awakenings,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Brillhart </PERSON>, who was awakened at her home a quarter-mile from the Rose Bowl by her shaking bed and the sound of her china crashing to the floor. The Rose Bowl is about two miles from City Hall. It was the strongest quake in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area since a 5.9 temblor on Oct. 1, 1987, and an aftershock two days later killed eight people, injured 200 and caused $ 358 million in damage. The 66-year-old Rose Bowl, home of the annual Tournament of Roses New Year's Day college football classic, appeared to be undamaged. Twenty-four people were treated for minor injuries at four hospitals. Most suffered cuts and bruises when they trippped and fell, nursing supervisors said. The most serious injury was a man who mistook the quake for an intruder and shot himself in the leg, said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON>, nursing supervisor at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>. An 18-year-old man apparently panicked and fell through a window, suffering minor abrasions, said <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USC-Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Norka </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>. `` It started out slow, then ` Bam!' for seven seconds,'' said <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON>, night manager at a grocery store, where the quake broke jelly jars, and juice and liquor bottles. `` The beef jerky fell down. The windows shook and the doors rattled,'' said <PERSON> Azad </PERSON> <PERSON> Medi </PERSON>, a clerk at a gas station and convenience store in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Toro </LOCATION>. Power outages were scattered throughout the area, including <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and parts of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The quake was felt in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> counties. About 100,000 customers of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> were without electricity for up to seven minutes, said spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Freudenburg </PERSON>. About 1,000 customers in the <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuys </LOCATION> area were without power for about 90 minutes. The temblor was at first believed to have been centered about six miles beneath the Rose Bowl. But additional readings later Saturday revealed the quake was centered 10 miles beneath the <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, about two miles east of original estimates, said Daily at <LOCATION> Caltech </LOCATION>. The City Hall was damaged in a stronger 1987 quake and now stands behind scaffolding, but did not appear to be damaged further although authorities had not yet closely examined it. `` A magnitude 5 is just beginning to get into the type of earthquake that one would expect damage, at least with the construction practices we have here,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> seismologist <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> officials said the quake broke a few residential gas lines and tripped numerous tripped burglar and auto alarms. The quake shattered plate glass windows in some stores. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gofstein </PERSON>, a newscaster for a radio station at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said he was at the station on the <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION> campus when the temblor hit. `` A lot of pranksters started calling up the station requesting the song ` Shake, Rattle and Roll,''' <PERSON> Gofstein </PERSON> said. Before the 1987 quakes in <LOCATION> Whittier </LOCATION>, the most destructive recent quake in metropolitan <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was the 1971 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> quake, which measured 6.4 and caused $ 511 million in damage. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5. An earthquake of 5 can cause considerable damage in the local area, 6 severe damage and a 7 reading is a `` major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage. An 8 is a `` great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale.

 Hundreds of firefighters and police from across the country paid tribute Saturday to six firefighters killed in an explosion blamed on arsonists. `` They were willing and able to take risks in their every day jobs for our protection, risk most of us would never dream of taking,'' Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkley </PERSON> told the mourners. `` So we owe these men a great deal. We owe them a commitment to do everything in our power to prevent things like this from ever happening again,'' the mayor said. Relatives of the six firefighters wiped away tears during parts of the hour-long ceremony at <LOCATION> Arrowhead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>. Flower arrangements covered the stadium's field, where football's <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> play. The firefighters died Tuesday when about 50,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate, a blasting agent, exploded at a highway construction site. They had responded to a report that a pickup and construction trailer were on fire. Witnesses have said they saw people prowling in the area earlier. An estimated 2,500 firefighters and public safety officers and 5,000 private citizens attended the memorial, said fire department spokesman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Knabe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firefighters </ORGANIZATION>, spoke to the gathering in a trembling voice. `` As firefighters, we see death, destruction, pain and sorrow all the time,'' said <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>. `` We do n't usually share it with anyone else, just ourselves.'' `` But that does n't mean we do n't laugh, we do n't love, we do n't cry, and we do n't hurt. Sgt. <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said police have received 50 to 75 tips, most of them after Wednesday's announcement of a $ 35,000 reward. An anonymous donor contributed $ 25,000. The men who died included two captains, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Halloran </PERSON>, 57, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilventon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 54, who between them had 66 years of experience with the department. Funerals were held Friday for the captains and firefighters <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McKarnin </PERSON>, 42, and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fry </PERSON>, 41. The rites for firefighter <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON>, 32, were Saturday, and those for firefighter <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, 31, will be Monday. On Friday, pumper trucks draped in black carried the first four firefighters to their graves, with <PERSON> Halloran </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kilventon </PERSON> buried not far from each other at a cemetery in suburban <LOCATION> Raytown </LOCATION>. `` It's difficult to try to reconcile the infinite love of God with what's happened here,'' said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diocese </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-St </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> `` We're called not just to know <PERSON> God </PERSON> and to love him, but to trust him and put outselves in his hands.'' `` These men are very special,'' he said. `` These men labor not much for monetary compensation but for the love of others.''

<HEAD>Ailing Artist Improving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARCELONA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The condition of ailing surrealist painter <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> is improving after nearly a week's hospitalization for severe heart trouble and blood clots in a lung, his doctors said Saturday In a statement, a five-doctor team said the 84-year-old artist `` continues to improve favorably both from the clinical point of view and that of the amount of oxygen in his blood.'' But they made no predictions about his further recovery. On Monday, a police-escorted ambulance rushed the artist to the Quiron Clinic here from a hospital in his hometown of <PERSON> Figueras </PERSON>, 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>. He was listed in critical condition at <LOCATION> Quiron </LOCATION> but began improving Thursday. He had entered <ORGANIZATION> Figueras </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday with pneumonia stemming from a prolonged cold. <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>, a famous for his limp watches draped over dreamlike landscapes, is the last member of an outstanding generation of Spanish painters. They included <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, who died in 1973, and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miro </PERSON>, who died a decade later. One of <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s doctors, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON>, told reporters that complications in the artist's condition could still arise `` but now there is less of a possibility. `` He gets out of bed each day to sit up in a chair for a good while,'' the doctor said. The statement said doctors will decide Monday whether to move <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> out of the intensive care unit of the hospital. Since August 1984, <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> has been ailing as a result of burns he suffered during a fire in the bedroom of his castle residence in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pera </LOCATION>, 40 miles south of <PERSON> Figueras </PERSON>. After release from a hospital three months later, <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> moved to a mansion attached to his Theater-Museum in <PERSON> Figueras </PERSON>. His brush with death left him bound to a wheel chair and eating through a gastro-nasal tube. Since then, a team of nurses has kept watch over him 24 hours a day. In July 1986, <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> underwent surgery in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> to receive a heart pacemaker.

<HEAD>Simon Says 1992 Presidential Bid Unlikely</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> expects to have all his presidential campaign debts paid off by early January, and he says he'll probably sit out the 1992 race for the White House. Instead, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said in a radio interview taped Friday that he is eager to `` start all over again'' on a campaign to retain his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat in 1990. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., said he has no problems with the Rev <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and does not expect a backlash from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters when he seeks re-election. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s presidential bid effectively ended after the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> primary, in which he defeated fellow <PERSON> Illinoisan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, but he kept a hold on the delegates he won until the Democratic National Convention. Some <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backers contend that <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s refusal to release his delegates after dropping out of the race undermined <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s broker status at the convention. `` I do n't think there will be much of a problem in 1990,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said, in the radio interview which is to be broadcast Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> WBBM </ORGANIZATION> radio. `` My voting record is clear on civil rights, things that are important to minorities.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` has earned his spurs'' within the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and should be viewed as one of the party's leaders, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said his unsuccessful presidential bid cost about $ 11 million and he expects to have all campaign debts paid off by next month. He said it is `` extremely unlikely'' that he would run for president again in 1992. His immediate task is to start raising the $ 6 million he expects to spend in the 1990 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said.

 A company that makes a vital material used in the space shuttle has signed a $ 17.75 million agreement that settles lawsuits accusing it of contaminating water and exposing workers to dangerous chemicals. The agreement, reached Friday with state officials, calls for <ORGANIZATION> Avtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fibers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to comply with water quality laws, make its plant safer for workers and pay $ 2 million in civil fines to the town of Front Royal. `` We recognized the importance of the plant, with its 1,300 jobs and the roles it plays in the space program and the national security,'' said state Attorney General <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>. `` But our primary duty was to safeguard the environment and protect the workers, of <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION>, and of the commonwealth. To accomplish that objective, we had to take a hard line.'' Avtex spokesman <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said <PERSON> Avtex </PERSON> managers were pleased to put the lawsuits behind them. `` They now intend to go forward with their business and take care of the various issues in these two decrees,'' he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. There was no answer Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> Avtex </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s home The agreement, filed in two consent degrees in circuit courts in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, includes $ 10 million in civil penalties if the company fails to comply. The agreement settles two lawsuits field by the attorney general's office. One filed for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> asked that Avtex be ordered to make certain repairs at the plant. The other lawsuit sought $ 19.7 million and was filed Nov. 2 on behalf of the state <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> for violations of the company's national pollution discharge elimination permit. Avtex closed the plant the next day, then reopened a week later after <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> guaranteed about $ 40 million in contracts. Avtex, the sole supplier of a type of rayon used in the space shuttle, agreed to reduce employee exposure to carbon disulfide gas. The chemical is used to make rayon and can cause a variety of ailments, some fatal. It also agreed to stop discharging untreated wastewater from the rayon process and to comply with existing and future pollution discharge permits. Avtex is required to place $ 5.7 million in a trust fund to pay for necessary repairs and changes. The provisions of the water quality settlement will be subject to approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> following 30 days for public review, and approval by Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> skirmished over farm subsidies on Saturday as trade ministers of more than 100 nations began arriving for global free-trade talks. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> is under heavy pressure from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as well as major grain-exporting nations, such as <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and host <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, to reduce the protection it gives its farmers. `` It's very clear that many divergences still exist -LRB- on agriculture -RRB-. I hope -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> is coming in like <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> with a bag full of realistic proposals,'' <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s minister for finance and foreign trade, said in a news conference. However, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators stuck to a tough line. `` No deal is better than a bad deal,'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON>, a top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate, said in a separate press conference. Trade ministers of 105 countries, including 96 member nations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, began arriving Saturday for the midterm review of free-trade talks under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, European, Japanese and Canadian negotiators met in an informal session on Saturday to review the prospects for the talks, which officially begin Monday. <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON> said the meeting `` crystallized the differences that exist'' between the parties, apparently referring mainly to the dispute over farm subsidies. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator, said cutting farm subsidies would save money for taxpayers and consumers. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> estimates that worldwide subsidies cost $ 200 billion a year. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said the 12-nation EEC, or Common Market, believes a compromise on agriculture is possible in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> drops its demand for a commitment from all the participants on the total elimination of trade-distorting farm price supports. He accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of `` looking for an alibi not to act in the short term'' by insisting on a long-term solution. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> is willing to adopt a freeze on agricultural subsidies in the coming two years and discuss their reduction, though not total elimination. But <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON>, in a later press conference, said setting an objective of total elimination of subsidies is the best way to make progress. He said <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> should find ways to protect its rural areas that do not lead to overproduction of food. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> would push ahead with efforts to reach agreement on removing barriers to the export of tropical products such as coffee, bananas and citrus fruit from developing nations. He rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands to link the tropical products issue to progress in the agricultural negotations. The current <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of talks began in <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Este </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, in 1986 and is scheduled to end in 1990. It is the most ambitious of the eight rounds of talks that have been held since the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> was formed after World War II, including for the first time such issues as trade in services and protection of intellectual property such as patents and copyrights. The <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> is both an agreement and an organization which has a permanent headquarters in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The talks are taking place, as usual, largely behind closed doors. They are theoretically scheduled to end on Wednesday, but are likely to last into Thursday or possibly Friday. <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON> said the representatives of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> agreed at their meeting Saturday that an agreement should be completed Wednesday night so it can be ratified by the trade ministers on Thursday.

 Police arrested more than 400 people for blocking entrances to abortion clinics in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> on Saturday, and just the threat of a sit-in closed a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> clinic, where protesters dispersed without incident. All of the demonstrations were peaceful and no injuries were reported, police said. `` The goal from the beginning was to lock the doors and save babies from abortion,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Rechten </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> demonstrators, who he said kept as many as 10 women from entering the clinic. `` We're just trying to give them the other side,'' <PERSON> Rechten </PERSON> said. `` We're not talking about a blob of protoplasm. We're talking about a human life.'' The protests are the latest in a series around the country mostly organized by a group called Operation Rescue and dating to this summer's Democratic National Convention. Hundreds of people have been arrested, many staying in jail for extended periods, refusing to identify themselves. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> police arrested about 250 anti-abortion demonstrators in a failed attempt to shut down a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Planned Parenthood clinic that provides abortions, counseling and other health services for women. The protesters prayed and sang, drawing jeers from a handful of pro-choice advocates. As the anti-abortion demonstrators sang `` God Bless <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' their counterparts chanted: `` Sexists, fascists, anti-gay! Born-again bigots, go away!'' <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinker </PERSON>, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman, said the clinic saw about 25 women during the day, about half the number of patients that visit on a normal Saturday. Those arrested were issued appearance tickets and then freed on their own recognizance, said Sgt. <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollomon </PERSON>, a police spokesman. In <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, 77 people were charged with trespassing at a Planned Parenthood clinic, and three of them faced additional charges of resisting arrest because they had to be carried to police vans, authorities said. <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the demonstrators, claimed success, saying: `` With the streets blocked off, the ` girls' ca n't get in there. They've got another day to think about it.'' <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of Planned Parenthood said the clinic had rearranged its appointment schedule in anticipation of the sit-in. Police arrested 56 people on trespassing charges after about 100 demonstrators blocked entrances to the <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palidar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, spokeswoman for the protest organizers. <LOCATION> Merrillville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, police arrested 34 anti-abortion protesters on criminal trespass charges after protesters blocked doors to a Planned Parenthood clinic. All but two of them were from out of town, police said. More than 50 peaceful demonstrators forced the closure of the Women's <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, an abortion clinic in <LOCATION> Howell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, but they dispersed about 11 a.m. and there were no arrests, police said. `` Once the clinic closed, that was the end of it,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wulfekotte </PERSON>.

 A congregation has voted to keep a nephew of the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> as its minister after the man admitted he had undergone treatment for cocaine and alcohol abuse. The Rev. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, 34, would have resigned if the congregation of <ORGANIZATION> Tabernacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> had offered a better severance package, church officials said. A majority of deacons asked the nephew of the late civil rights leader to resign after he announced from the pulpit two weeks ago that he had completed the treatment program. But the congregation voted 107-68 on Thursday to keep King, guaranteeing him the job for another year. He earns $ 26,000 annually and pays no rent or utility bills. Before the meeting with the congregation, <PERSON> King </PERSON> and his attorney met for 30 minutes with church officials discussing possible severance pay options.

 A company where a worker died after inhaling toxic fumes when he fell face-down in a puddle of a highly corrosive form of acid will be fined $ 6,480 for various safety violations, federal officials announced. <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> was cited for eight infractions, some of which contributed to the October death, said <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, industrial hygiene supervisor at the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> office.

 Thirteen filmmakers trapped more than 250 feet underground in a desert cave slipped to safety one-by-one through a tiny hole dug by rescuers on Saturday, authorities said. The group was trapped when a sudden rainstorm caused the mouth of the cave to collapse as they were making a documentary film in an isolated desert known as Nullarbor Plain in southwestern <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The last of the group emerged Saturday evening from a small escape route that police said they had managed to dig. Police said no one was injured. However, they described rescue conditions as very dangerous. `` It was raining and freezing cold, and they were afraid there would be another cave-in at any time,'' said police spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Tree </PERSON>. `` The rescuers had to be very careful. `` Police made a hole big enough for them to squeeze through one at a time, and they came out very slowly.'' The group was filming a documentary on the system of caverns near the tiny township of <LOCATION> Cocklebiddy </LOCATION> on Friday when the storm washed away rocks, blocking the entrance to the cave. Tree said the group, all experienced cave explorers from their mid-20s to 40 years old, were recovering from their ordeal in <LOCATION> Cocklebiddy </LOCATION>. Eleven of the group were Australians, and one was from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and one from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. They were identified. The Nullarbor is a huge, dry plain with an extensive cave system underneath.

<HEAD>Father Seeks Custody Of Child Put Up For Adoption</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will hear arguments this week in a custody battle between a child's biological and adoptive parents in a case that could curtail privately arranged adoptions in the state. The court is being asked to decide if a man who virtually ignored his pregnant girlfriend after she refused to have an abortion can retain the right to challenge her decision to put the baby up for adoption. The man began the challenge shortly after the baby was born two years ago, and he also later reconciled with and married the mother. Arguments were scheduled to be heard Tuesday, with a ruling expected in about a month. `` Certainly, it would concern me if the court was to say the biological father could show up at any point and have the adoption overturned,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Coler </PERSON>, state secretary of health and rehabilitative services. `` It puts the chance of establishing permanency for the child at great risk.'' Paternal rights in adoptions have been in the legal spotlight recently in several states. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> heard a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case in which a man sought visitation rights to his 7-year-old daughter given up for adoption. In the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> case, court documents use assumed names, calling the adoptive parents <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> and the biological parents <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> gave upthe child up for adoption within 48 hours of his birth. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, who initially had refused to get married and had urged an abortion, then hired a lawyer, acknowledged paternity and sought to halt the adoption. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> were reconciled, and married when the baby was 2 months old. In June 1987, a judge ruled against <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, saying he had effectively abandoned the child during <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>'s pregnancy. The adoptive parents provided an apartment, paid her medical costs and gave her $ 300 a month for expenses. A state appeals court reversed the ruling in March, saying the father's consent was necessary in a privately arranged adoption. However, the appeals court left the boy with his adoptive parents until the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> could review the case. Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Carbo </PERSON> said a decision for <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> could mean the end of privately arranged adoptions. `` If the putative father could come in and essentially negate the entire adoption proceeding, because of the fact he was n't consulted or he did n't know he was the father at the time, would you invest a significant amount of time and money in the expenses surrounding the birth?'' he asked.

 An synthetic narcotic similar to heroin that caused at least 13 deaths was produced by a professional chemist in a basement laboratory at the home he shares with his elderly parents, authorities said. An informant led city, state and federal agents to the home of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefers </PERSON>, 48, in suburban <PERSON> Aspinwall </PERSON> late Thursday, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> said Friday. Schaefers, jailed on a charge of drug manufacturing, is the latest of 12 suspects arrested in connection with the drug 3-methyl-fentanyl, also known as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> White. Besides the 13 deaths confirmed to be caused by the drug, it is suspected in seven additional deaths. <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> said the informant claimed <PERSON> Schaefers </PERSON> made <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> White with ingredients obtained at his job in a <ORGANIZATION> Calgon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> lab outside <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and from a pharmacist who wrote phony prescriptions. <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> did not identify the informant, who he said is an addict who got the idea for making synthetic heroin from a television news report nearly two years ago about so-called designer drugs. The informant took the idea to Schaefers, who began working on the compound in November 1987 and made a successful batch on his third attempt, <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> said. In addition to that one-ounce batch, <PERSON> Schaefers </PERSON> made a second, larger batch that netted him and the informant $ 14,000 in profits, <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> said. Schaefers has a bachelor's degree in chemistry and has been a staff chemist at <ORGANIZATION> Calgon </ORGANIZATION>'s industrial water treatment research center in <LOCATION> Robinson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> since 1977, said company spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Erdner </PERSON>. Calgon officials promised to cooperate with police. Six people suspected as leading distributors of the drug also were arrested Thursday. Five others were charged earlier.

 An official of the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear plant says he would like to see a joint U.S.-Soviet reactor built to help prevent future accidents. `` I think that only by joint efforts can we create a new, modern type of reactor which could exclude the negative impact on the environment and exclude the possibility of such accidents which happened at Three Mile Island and <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Borisyuk </PERSON>, deputy secretary of <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, said in an interview Friday. <PERSON> Borisyuk </PERSON> is one of 10 Soviets and 11 Americans on the Global Environment Commission of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Emerging Leaders Summit, a weeklong gathering of more than 340 Americans and Soviets that began Thursday. The delegates spent much of Saturday watching the <ORGANIZATION> Army-Navy </ORGANIZATION> football game at Veterans Stadium and visiting the <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> and Independence Hall. <PERSON> Ilona </PERSON> <PERSON> Zheleznyako </PERSON>, 30, a housing construction engineer from <LOCATION> Tinda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, touched the historic bell, which rang in July 1776 to announce the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. She said she felt `` a good feeling of freedom and liberty.'' <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Chelnokov </PERSON>, 34, said he was impressed with the longevity of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution. `` In our country, there is a rethinking of some of the ideas of our revolution, and we are now reconstructing a society which is only 70 years old,'' he said. `` So it is amazing that something that is three times as old is still working.'' The summit is focused on private meetings of 16 commissions assigned areas of discussion such as the environment, military affairs, religion, science, business, the media and the arts. The <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> will look at such topics as global warming, ozone depletion, acid rain, ocean waste, economic development and international agreements. The conference comes as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has begun re-examining conservation practices and giving citizens a greater voice in environmental protection. The 1986 explosion and fire at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> was the world's worst nuclear accident. It killed at least 33 people, sent a radioactive cloud around the globe and made an area within a 40-mile radius of the plant uninhabitable. At <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s Three Mile Island reactor, equipment failures and human error led to a loss of coolant and partial core meltdown in 1979. `` The main lesson is the imperfection of technology that is used at atomic power plants both in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION>, and also imperfection of personnel training,'' <PERSON> Borisyuk </PERSON> said. He said he believes nuclear energy remains the safest and least-polluting form of energy, if properly managed.

 A man threatening to blow the CBS network studios to `` kingdom come'' demanded to read a statement on camera about a child custody fight but surrendered an hour after the standoff began Saturday, police said.

The man's letter outlined his problems stemming from a 1984 family court arrangement, said Deputy Police Inspector <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalabrino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Martuchi </PERSON> wanted to speak with a reporter, but agreed to allow a police cameraman to make a videotape of his statement, the inspector said. `` I think he wanted to get on camera to tell people what his trouble was,'' <PERSON> Scalabrino </PERSON> said. The building on West 57th Street in <LOCATION> mid-Manhattan </LOCATION> also contains CBS network studios and is the home of `` 60 Minutes'' and `` West 57th Street.'' An X-ray indicated that the item in the suitcase was only a brick, police said.

<HEAD>Hawaii Catholics Protest $45 Million Sale Of Church Property</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Clergy and parishioners of a Roman Catholic church Saturday criticized their bishop's decision to sell to Japanese investors the ocean-front land on which their parish has worshiped since the 1830s. The $ 45 million deal, which will result in the demolition of the copper-roofed, modernistic <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Augustine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the heart of <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> and the building of a new church nearby, was announced Friday by Bishop <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrario </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. Diocese offices were besieged with phone calls Friday and Saturday after news reports of the sale. The diocese hired a public relations firm to help field the calls. An advertisement taken out in the major daily newspapers here Saturday urged Catholics to protest by writing to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, which would have the power to overturn <PERSON> Ferrario </PERSON>'s decision. The church, built in 1962, is situated on a 50,000-square-foot parcel where the Sacred Hearts Fathers have led services since a thatched missionary church was built in the 1830s. Members of the order and the congregation complained that the deal went through without their approval. `` I thought they were going to take our feelings into consideration,'' said <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Trask </PERSON>, one of about 35 parish members invited to a meeting with the bishop in May to discuss unsolicited offers that were being made for the church property amid a land boom fueled by Japanese investments. The purchaser announced Friday is <PERSON> Hama </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikaku </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> real estate company. The company agreed to allow the church to remain free of rent for 2 -LCB- years while a new church is built several blocks away on property also owned by <PERSON> Hama </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikaku </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diocese </LOCATION> said. After the new church is built, $ 25 million will be left for a variety of educational and charitable causes, <PERSON> Ferrario </PERSON> said. `` I really think this use of real property is a real stewardship of our properties,'' he said. `` It's a question of justice _ the haves serving the have-nots, of respecting the rights of people of the parish.'' At $ 45 million, the property is going for $ 900 a square foot, compared with $ 400 a square foot in other recent sales of similar <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> property. The Rev. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynaems </PERSON>, a retired priest who served as <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Augustine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> pastor from 1980 to 1983, said, `` Many priests are flabbergasted that he -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Ferrario </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- does n't consider the history of the place.'' Newspapers here reported that company officials could not be reached for comment on what they intended to do with the property, but there was speculation that a luxury hotel or condominiums would be built. The property is across the street from <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> beach, whereas the new site the church would be given is several blocks from the beach.

 The La Scala chorus and dance company called off their strike and returned to rehearsals Saturday night, clearing the way for Wednesday night's opening of the opera season. Earlier in the day, the more than 200 artists had voted to continue boycotting rehearsals to protest a labor contract they say favors the orchestra.

 Police confirmed Saturday they were investigating eight suspicious deaths of elderly residents of a nursing home in this Grand Rapids suburb. Police said earlier that the investigation was limited to the deaths of <PERSON> Marguerite </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, 60, and <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, 98, whose bodies underwent autopsies after being exhumed last week. But Police Chief <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprenger </PERSON> said during a Saturday news conference that <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> were among eight Alpine Manor Nursing Home residents whose deaths during the first six months of 1987 were under investigation. <PERSON> Sprenger </PERSON> said police have not determined a motive. He would not elaborate on potential suspects, saying: `` We're trying to focus in on who are the specific suspects. We have rumors, we have names, we have a list of names.'' Autopsies were not conducted at the time the patients died because the deaths were considered natural at the time. But <PERSON> Sprenger </PERSON> said detectives began investigating the deaths in early October, using a list of `` eight potential victims'' provided by a source he would not identify. `` We've continued on because we are convinced that something has occurred,'' <PERSON> Sprenger </PERSON> said, adding that police were investigating reports that some victims had been suffocated. Results of an autopsy on Chambers were inconclusive, and results of a Saturday autopsy on <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> were not immediately available, <PERSON> Sprenger </PERSON> said. At least one other body might have to be exhumed, he said. Three of the eight were cremated. A woman answering the telephone at the nursing home Saturday evening referred all questions to a public relations firm. There was no answer there.

 Candles were lighted in the windows of homes across the country Saturday as Jews began celebrating the eight-day Festival of Lights, or Hanukkah, which commemorates the victory of the Jews over the Syrians 2,000 years ago. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio broadcast festive songs throughout the night, and bakeries served the special sugar-coated jelly doughnuts that are a holiday tradition. Hanukkah marks the victory of the Jews over the Greco-Syrian kingdom in 165 B.C. The kingdom had tried to impose its culture on the Jews and desecrated the holy temple in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> with statues of <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> gods. The statues were regarded as pagan idols, which are anathema to Jews. The Jews rose in revolt, destroyed the statues and drove the Syrians out of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. According to legend, when the Jews tried to relight the temple's eternal flame, they found enough oil for one day But the fire miraculously lasted for eight days. To commemorate the holiday, candles are lighted at sunset for eight consecutive nights. They are placed one at a time in a special eight-branch candelabra called a menorah. Fried foods such as potato pancakes and doughnuts are eaten to commemorate the miracle of the oil. The festival is celebrated by religious and secular Jews as a holiday that not only marks the ancient Jewish victory but also reminds Israelis of their desire to perpetuate national Jewish identity.

 Celebrity divorce lawyer <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchelson </PERSON> has been hit with new charges by the State Bar of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for allegedly refusing to pay for $ 1 million in jewelry bought in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>.

 Four Soviet gunmen who seized a busload of children in southern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and then traded them for a $ 3.3 million ransom and a plane to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were sent home Saturday with the airplane crew they held hostage. The four hijackers left in two planes with the eight-member <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> crew that brought them to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a 19-member Soviet delegation that arrived Saturday to arrange the return, officials said. Preparations for the departure were shown live on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television, with soldiers guarding the runway at <LOCATION> Ben-Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency later reported that the planes landed at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Sheremetyevo-1 airport at about 6 p.m. EST. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the ransom money was returned to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had requested extradition of the hijackers, but ultimately <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> deported them as illegal immigrants. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said this helped `` shorten the process.'' As a condition for returning the hijackers, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> received assurances the four men would not face the death penalty, <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported that one of the hijackers requested political asylum in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said he could not confirm that. Originally, there were believed to be five hijackers. However, it was determined that the wife of one of the hijackers was not part of the plot. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> identified her as a hostage. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> army chief of staff, called the hijackers Friday `` simple criminals with a lot of money who wanted to flee the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' The saga began Thursday, when the four gunmen seized a bus carrying 30 schoolchildren on an excursion in <LOCATION> Ordzhonikidze </LOCATION>, a city 900 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. After hours of negotiations, the gunmen traded the children for an <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> jetliner out of the country, a flight crew of eight and a ransom of $ 3.3 million. A teacher on the bus, <PERSON> Natalya </PERSON> <PERSON> Efimova </PERSON>, told state-run Soviet television that one of the gunmen announced to the children, `` I will release anyone who will burn his red scarf.'' The teacher said the children, who wear the scarves as part of their school uniforms, stuffed them in their pockets to reduce the provocation. The <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> jet landed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Friday evening and the Soviets surrendered soon afterward. They were immediately taken to a prison near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. The released crew spent the night in a <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> hotel. The deportation Saturday ended two days of unusual diplomatic contacts, during which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials played a role in getting the hijackers to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> thanked the Israelis for returning them. <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met with an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> consular delegation in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Saturday `` to express the thanks and deep appreciation of the Soviet government and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people regarding the noble way the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has dealt with this barbaric act.'' Relations between the two nations have gradually been warming over the past few years. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> severed diplomatic ties in 1967 after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured land from its <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> allies during the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television quoted Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> as saying he hoped <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s handling of the incident would lead to greater understanding between his country and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Early in the drama, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> acted as an intermediary to help the two nations compensate for the lack of formal diplomatic ties, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> <PERSON> Haber </PERSON> said. Two of the Soviets were sent back on the Ilyushin-76 that brought them to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The other three were returned in a Tupolev airliner that brought the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation to <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> on Saturday. Soviet officials also were given the ransom money and the weapons carried by the hostages after signing a receipt for them, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television reported. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio said the five were taken blindfolded from <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabir </PERSON> jail in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> to Ben-Gurion about two hours before their departure. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponomarev </PERSON>, deputy <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief, identified the ringleader of the group as 38-year-old <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakshiants </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ponomarev </PERSON> said the man was a drug-user who first asked to go to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

 Would-be millionaires snapped up lottery tickets at a rate of 28,000 a minute Saturday, lining up for a chance for at least $ 45 million, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s biggest-ever jackpot. There was no immediate word on whether anyone had chosen the winning combination chosen late Saturday, which was heavy on the number 8: 1-8-13-18-28-48. Lottery officials said it would probably take until sometime Sunday for computers to calculate the final jackpot and determine whether anyone got it. `` I actually would n't know what to do with that kind of money. But I bet I'd suddenly find a lot of friends to help me spend it,'' said <PERSON> Noreen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cliffside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. If a single ticketholder won the $ 45 million Lotto jackpot, he would get about $ 1.7 million a year for 20 years after withholding taxes. The odds of winning the biggest jackpot in the 12-year-old state lottery were 12.9 million to 1. For a $ 1 ticket, a player chooses two combinations of six numbers from 1 to 54. Lines stretched outside stationery, tobacco and drug stores throughout the state in temperatures mostly in the upper 40s. The pace started picking up Friday evening, when sales increased from 18,000 a minute to 22,000 at the 5,800 computerized ticket outlets statewide. By Saturday morning, they reached 28,000 tickets a minute, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowlton </PERSON>, a spokesman for the lottery. The jackpot rose to a guaranteed $ 45 million after no one picked the winning numbers in Wednesday's drawing, when the jackpot was $ 26 million. Acting Lottery Director <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Gladieux </PERSON> said Friday the jackpot could go slightly higher, depending on sales. The world's biggest lottery jackpot, $ 61.98 million, was divided among three tickets in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in October; one ticket was held by 25 co-workers and another was held by 15. The largest single winner was a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> woman who claimed $ 55.16 million in September. The largest previous jackpot in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was $ 41 million in 1985. That was divided among three winning tickets, including one held by 21 factory workers. The biggest single winner in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state lottery history was a man who won $ 30.5 million in 1986.

<HEAD>Report: Nir Claimed Secret US-Israeli Agreement For Covert
Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Israeli linked to the Iran-Contra affair who died in a plane crash last week said in June that a secret U.S.-Israeli agreement authorized counterterrorist operations he supervised with former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said in its Sunday editions. <PERSON> Amiram </PERSON> <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official who died in a crash in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on Wednesday, told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> last summer that the agreement authorized still-secret operations that he and <PERSON> North </PERSON> supervised in 1985-86, the newspaper said. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said American and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources confirmed the existence of the Israeli-American agreement, referred to as `` terms of reference'' or `` accords'' by some knowledgeable sources. The paper said the agreement never was disclosed to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>, who served as an adviser on counterterrorism to two Israeli prime ministers, maintained that the secret U.S.-Israeli covert operations were authorized by an agreement signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and then-Israeli Prime Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, said the Post. Other sources said the agreement was signed at a lower level in the two governments, the newspaper said. Although few details of these operations have been disclosed, the paper said, <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> said the Israeli government has detailed records of all of them. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said one operation conducted under the agreement was the organizing of an armed force of Lebanese Druze in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in May 1986, at a time when the White House was considering the use of force to try to free American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. As described by <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>, the agreement led to a series of covert actions that had common tactical elements, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. The secret transactions that led to the diversion of U.S.-Iran arms sales profits to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> may have fit a pattern established in those undertakings, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> was interviewed by Post reporter <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> on June 25 and June 26 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, with an agreement that none of the information would be attributed to him without further discussions, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in October that he still was not ready to `` go public'' with the information, the newspaper said. It said Post editors concluded that <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>'s death removed the reasons for the agreement to withhold attribution of the information he had provided. <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON>, a White House spokesman, declined comment on the story. Officials at the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> were unavailable for comment late Saturday. But embassy spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gal </PERSON> told the Post: `` I wo n't go into this agreement. ... <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have lots of agreements. ... Everything he -LRB- Nir -RRB- did was being done by the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had assembled extensive records, based in part on his detailed notes and papers, that were not turned over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The records provide point-by-point documentation of all contacts, discussions and undertakings with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, including <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> said he also provided full written reports to his superiors and gave oral briefings to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> prime minister who hired him, and later to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' successor, <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. North, who is under indictment in the Iran-Contra case, suggested during testimony heard by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional investigators that the plan to divert money to the Contras was <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>'s idea. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> denied that. The agreement is among the classified documents that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers are seeking to introduce into evidence at the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide's trial, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said, citing an unidentified source It said <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, declined to comment. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> was an important liaison in the secret arms deals, according to testimony before the congressional investigators. His activities included trips to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He was sought for questioning by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, but <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> insisted that he be granted immunity from prosecution.

 President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> on Saturday ordered the army to crush a three-day revolt by rebel troops, and thousands of citizens poured into the streets to rally for democracy. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> went on national television after government troops allowed hundreds of mutinous, heavily armed soldiers to leave an infantry school they had seized and move to another military base. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> told the nation that he has ordered the army to `` suffocate'' the rebellion. Argentine news agencies later reported heavy troop movements, which they interpreted as preparations by loyalist forces to end the rebellion. Local news agencies said scores of angry civilians hurled rocks at the military compound where the rebels were holed up about 12 miles outside of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, and that the rebels responded with tear gas and shots fired into the air. The leader of the rebels, Col. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON>, insisted in a statement read to reporters by a subordinate that his rebellion `` lacks political motivation and was initiated for military reasons.'' The country's democratic institutions `` are not in danger,'' it said. The mutinous soldiers began their revolt Thursday to protest the criminal trials of officers who have been charged with committing human rights abuses during the military dictatorships that ruled the country from 1976-83. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> described the revolt as a `` seditious attempt'' against `` well-being, tolerance and liberty.'' He assured citizens that the revolt `` does not endanger the republic nor the ... constitution.'' The government broadcast repeated pleas on national television Saturday for citizens to rally for democracy. Thousands of people were reportedly gathering in streets and squares nationwide, including about 5,000 in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. Several ambassadors arrived at the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, including <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Gildred </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We are here to lend our complete solidarity to the consolidation of democracy,'' <PERSON> Gildred </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement that said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent `` their firm and unwavering support'' for Argentine democracy. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> met with aides and <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members Saturday in the heavily guarded Government House. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also met in an emergency session on Saturday. Congressman <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaroslavsky </PERSON> of <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called on citizens to `` go into the street to defend democracy.'' `` This is the moment,'' <PERSON> Jaroslavsky </PERSON> said. He acknowledged that loyal armed forces members `` have not been able to dominate the rebels.'' <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugliese </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, said `` Democracy is in danger,'' and called the insurrection `` a clear coup attempt.'' The insurrection began Thursday when about 400 soldiers deserted their posts under the leadership of the charismatic <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON>. The group, joined later by about 50 coast guard members, seized an infantry school Friday morning at the giant <LOCATION> Campo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mayo </LOCATION> military base 22 miles northwest of the capital. Government forces surrounded the base and exchanged several rounds of mortar and rifle fire with rebels Friday, during which four people were wounded, the army said Saturday. News reports said one person was killed, but there was no official confirmation. On Saturday, the rebels left the base. Government forces did not fire on the rebels, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the rebels drove past government troops aboard several trucks loaded with weapons and ammunition. <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION> said the rebels arrived later at a motorized military unit in <LOCATION> Villa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martelli </LOCATION> about eight miles away. The unit's officers earlier had been reported as sympathizing with the rebels. The rebels fortified their positions and set up snipers. At least six tanks were seen. Several explosions were heard outside the base late Saturday night, the private news agencies <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Argentinas </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Diarios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> y </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION> said lights at the base went out shortly afterward. More than 100 area residents showed their opposition to the rebels by shouting insults and stoning a car as it entered the base and rebels responded with tear gas, the reports said. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> acknowleged Saturday that <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers and military chiefs meeting at <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> were `` nervous,'' and noted the presidential guard was being reinforced. `` If a group of rebels moves from one place to another and you do n't know where they're going, the least you have to do to protect the president is reinforce the guard,'' he said. Military uprisings in 1987 and in January were led by Lt. Col. <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rico </PERSON>, now discharged and imprisoned. They were called to support fellow officers being prosecuted in civilian courts for human rights abuses during the dark days of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s military dictatorships. During the dictatorships, at least 9,000 Argentines `` disappeared'' and were presumed executed by security forces. In December 1985, five former junta members, including former military presidents <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Videla </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Viola </PERSON>, were convicted in civilian court for crimes including kidnapping, torture and murder. The military President <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> in 1976. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, a human rights activist, was elected president after the military junta finally allowed elections in 1983.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Soviets Must Level Radar Station To Complete START
Treaty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has told the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a new treaty to sharply reduce long-range nuclear weapons will be completed only if a Siberian radar station is leveled. In a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, the president said Soviet proposals to convert the disputed <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> installation into an international space research facility `` would not correct'' its violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. `` We can not conclude new strategic arms control agreement while this violation remains uncorrected,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The proposed new treaty would reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet arsenals of long-range nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent. Negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> were adjourned last month with the two sides agreeing to resume them in early 1989. The report also accused the Soviets of violating the 1972 ABM treaty by moving radar and electronics equipment to <LOCATION> Gomel </LOCATION>, about 350 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. And <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the Soviets violated the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention of 1972 by maintaining `` an active offensive biological warfare program and capability.'' Other `` probable'' violations of test ban and chemical weapons agreements were alleged in the report, an unclassified version of which was made public by the White House. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> informed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he had reserved the right to take `` appropriate and proportionate responses'' to <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>, which the report said violates the ABM treaty's ban on trying to set up a nationwide anti-missile defense. But he stopped short of declaring <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> a `` material breach'' of the treaty. Such a declaration would be a first step toward possible <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> abrogation of the treaty, considered a landmark in nuclear arms control. Some of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s advisers had recommended he take that step. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not tell <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the classified report what measures the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may take in response to <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>. In the past, however, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said retaining two or three nuclear Trident submarines that were due to be dismantled was a possible option. However, the president cautioned that `` in order to broaden the basis for cooperation between our two countries, the Soviets must correct their violations and noncompliance activities with respect to the ABM treaty and other arms control agreements.'' On the other hand, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, the Soviets had resolved `` to our satisfaction'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> questions about their compliance with the treaty to abolish intermediate-range ballistic missiles. That agreement was signed a year ago. These included transporting missile parts to and from repair shops and moving missiles outside designated zones, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who demanded anonymity told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the president's national security adviser, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was not expected to make `` a major issue'' of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> complaints of Soviet treaty violations in his meeting next Wednesday with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.

 The final word on fruitcake is out in time for Christmas after a five-year battle that reached the highest echelon of German justice. In a decision handed down Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the distinction of `` Dresden Fruitcake'' was determined to be its content, not the location of the ovens that produce it.

 Federal inspectors say they were impressed with the pilots at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and found no serious flaws with the management. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> inspection, conducted in October, which did find some shortcomings in record-keeping and listed 142 specific items in which there were technical violations of federal regulations. Among the concerns raised by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspection team were that <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> pilots on numerous occasions did not get enough rest between flights, that records were incomplete and that manuals often were not up to date. The inspection by a special team of investigators was similar to those regularly scheduled at all major air carriers and not prompted by any specific incident or concern. Many of the 142 violations cited in the report were not considered to be major. For example, a flight attendant was found with no flashlight, `` fasten seat belt'' signs were found missing on the back of some aircraft seats, and an inspector observed two pilots eating their meals at the same time while at cruising altitude _ all technical violations of regulations. Among other items cited in the report were pilots who failed to record maintenance discrepancies in a log after items were fixed, a pilot not making proper altitude callouts during a landing and a crew failing to use an anti-ice mechanism while descending in possible icing conditions. But the team of <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors said that overall, `` team members were very impressed with the professionalism displayed by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> cockpit and cabin crews while conducting en route inspections. Cockpit resource management was evident on all flights.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> report said the inspectors conducted 358 en route inspections at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> beginning last Oct. 13. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s management `` is adequate for the scope of the operation'' but that at times there are problems with the flow of information from upper and middle management to first-line supervisors and personnel. Flight and training manuals have not been brought up to date because of the introduction of a wide array of aircraft to the airline as it expanded and absorbed other air carriers, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. Some manuals were not accurate in the location of some emergency equipment such as fire extinguishers on certain aircraft, the report said. The inspection team said that <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s training program `` is in compliance'' with regulations but it said training records did not always clearly reflect in summary sheets when a pilot's performance was unsatisfactory In addition, inspectors were not able to adequately determine whether <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> pilots are in full compliance with flight and duty regulations because of poor record-keeping. `` On numerous occasions <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight crews received less than the -LRB- amount -RRB- of reduced rest required by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s operations manual pilot scheduling policy,'' said the report.

 Prince <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Anhalt </PERSON> qualifies as a jet-set artist in a literal sense. He creates his artwork by standing behind jet engines, throwing buckets of paint into the air and having the high-velocity propellant of the engines splatter the colors against his canvas. `` The paintings are of course abstract,'' <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Anhalt </PERSON> said Friday. Their creation also is a little risky, because he has to stand in the way of the jet's force. On Thursday, the platform he stood on at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakefront </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, warming up for his performance today, upended moments after he stepped out of the jets' 80 mph blast. `` Should debris go through the jet engines it could penetrate me like a bullet,'' <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Anhalt </PERSON> said. `` And then the fumes can be intoxicating.''

Most of his fans say the paintings remind them of volcanoes, the creation of light or something else explosive, said <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Anhalt </PERSON>.

 A 13-year-old boy was being held in the theft of about $ 50,000 worth of comic books, and the crime had nothing to do with the youth's fascination with Wonder Woman or Batman, a detective said. The teen-ager was arrested and some of the stolen books were recovered Thursday, said police Detective <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Camp </PERSON>. The thieves apparently knew which comics to take and their value, <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> said. Another arrest and the recovery of several hundred more comics was expected later, <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> said. The books were taken from Books, Comics and Things on Oct. 21 and 23. In the first break-in, a front window was broken and about $ 2,000 worth of comics were snatched. In the second, a rock was heaved through a side window, and high-priced comics dating back to the early 1940s were taken. `` I've been beating the bushes for a month,'' Camp said. `` Not just because it's my job, but because it torqued my jaws that they'd hit it -LRB- the store -RRB- twice in three days. News of the burglaries appeared in a comic-book collector trade magazine, resulting in calls from dealers across the country inquiring how to spot the missing books, said <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, the store's co-owner. The stolen comics included rare books published during World War II featuring stories of superheroes pummeling Nazis and more modern issues with tales of mutants battling masked villains.

<TEXT>
 The `` let it burn'' policy, sharply criticized after fires ravaged <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, should stand with minor changes to improve communication, federal officials said Friday. Teams of forest experts who reviewed four of the major fires that covered about half of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s 2.2 million acres last summer also concluded that management decisions were sound, for the most part, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Neckels </PERSON>, deputy director of the Rocky Mountain region of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The findings of the teams, which looked at the fires from the preseason indicators through containment, were released Friday during a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. `` The teams found that no wholesale changes in the fire policy are required,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gargill </PERSON>, regional forester of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` They found that the policy and the implemented plans need to be strengthened for some specific acceptable limits on such things as weather ... and the effects of drought,'' he said. The `` let it burn'' policy, which has been adopted by both the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NPS </ORGANIZATION>, allows natural fires to burn out by themselves unless they threaten property or humans. It drew wide criticism during the fires at <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> by many who believed the blazes should have been fought more aggressively. The review team reports will be forwarded to a policy-making team formed by the secretaries of <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. That panel is scheduled to give recommendations on the `` let it burn'' policy to <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> as of Dec. 15. At that point, another review process, including public comment, will be conducted. Among the weaknesses identified by the reviews was a lack of uniform definitions for terms, and a need for improved coordination of fire management directions among the various forests and parks with similar boundaries. <PERSON> Neckels </PERSON> said the latter problem was identified a year ago as a priority for improving, but was not resolved before the summer. `` Where you have boundaries like that, clearly you ca n't have that much of a difference,'' <PERSON> Neckels </PERSON> said. `` You have to have better coordination. We knew that, but we did n't get a chance to fix it prior to last season.'' Another problem to be addressed is establishing specific limits on factors such as weather, the number of fires to allow within a park, the effects of droughts, he said. `` What acreage point should we begin to say, ` Whoa.' These are the things that we have to consider,'' he said. During briefings Wednesday and Thursday, review team members said that `` for the most part, the actions were sound, the decisions were sound,'' <PERSON> Neckels </PERSON> said. `` Certainly there were mistakes that were made; there were things that we would do differently. But, all in all, certainly I feel good about what our professional staff and the staff of other agencies did,'' he said. More than 249 fires were identified in the park last summer, the worst on record in the <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> since 1910. The firefighters concentrated on 13 blazes that were identified as the most destructive, including one that threatened Old Faithful and another that forced the evuatation of the communities of Silvergate and <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gargill </PERSON> said 201 fires were suppresssed at 10 acres or less for an 80 percent suppression rate. The two agencies plan to begin working on the problem areas, with a goal of resolving them by April, he said. Setting a fire management policy is sort of like `` building a church,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> said. `` You do n't size a church for an Easter Sunday crowd, and this was an Easter Sunday fire.''

 <PERSON> Bev </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> became the first 40-year-old to serve detention at <ORGANIZATION> Dublin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> after she forgot to explain her son's absence. She volunteered for the punishment after Vice Principal <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Basacker </PERSON> said her son, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kayne </PERSON>, would be suspended for failing to show up for a detention resulting from the unexcused absence. Mrs. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said her son was sick, but she forgot to call school officials within 24 hours as required by school rules. `` I said that if I did n't do what I was supposed to do, I should go on detention,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> reported to the principal's office Wednesday afternoon and spent an hour filing papers and trimming posters. `` They said they could n't make me do homework, so they'd make me do clerical work,'' she said. The beautician will take off work again next week to serve the final three hours on her sentence. `` I'm trying to teach my son to take responsibility for his actions,'' she said. `` If he's cutting class, I want him to get caught. But I, as a mother, am a role model, and I have to take responsibility for my actions.''

 Here's an equation that students at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION>'s Indian School understand: One 15-passenger Dodge van equals 975,000 <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s soup labels. They collected and bundled the labels and shipped them off to the soup company. The van, with air conditioning and an AM-FM stereo, should arrive any day. The school's 186 students took about a year to collect the labels as part of <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> program, which for years has offered free equipment to schools and libraries for labels from company products.

The van will help transport students from their homes to the school about 120 miles west of <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. The program did not offer a van as a prize until school officials requested it, <PERSON> Westhoven </PERSON> said. `` I asked the company to consider offering a van, and they did finally after a year.''

<HEAD>Eastern Airlines Unions Ask Court To Block Sale To Trump</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> argued in federal court that the unions at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> want to stop it `` dead in its tracks'' by blocking the sale of its shuttle operation, while the unions argued the company wants to intimidate the unions. Both sides began presenting their cases Friday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> in the first of six days of hearings on the proposed sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Northeast shuttle system to real estate mogul <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. Eastern and <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> announced in mid-October a $ 365 million agreement allowing <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> to buy the shuttle, which provides hourly flights between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and to change the name to the Trump Shuttle. But three unions representing pilots, mechanics and flight attendants at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> filed suit, asking that the sale be blocked on grounds it violates labor laws. During opening arguments Friday, airline attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said the unions want Eastern `` stopped dead in its tracks'' in its attempt to make the airline profitable by reducing its size. `` No employees are being forced out of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>,'' he declared. `` All -LRB- shuttle employees -RRB- can elect to remain at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>.'' But lawyers for the three unions countered that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s sale of the shuttle, which has been <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s only profitable operation, is part of an overall scheme by parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to dismember the airline. `` This is in fact a liquidation,'' declared <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrieri </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union. `` Without the shuttle, there is no way this airline can make it back to profitability.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>, an attorney representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots, said the unions intend to show that the sale of the shuttle violates federal laws governing collective bargaining in the airline industry because it is aimed at putting pressure on the unions. Eastern and the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union are in the midst of bargaining for a new contract. `` The sale of the shuttle is being used as shock treatment,'' said <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said the decision to sell the shuttle is not unlike <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s other recent decisions aimed at reducing the airline's size In September, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> curtailed its flights by 12 percent and eliminated 4,000 jobs. The airline currently employs about 30,000 people including about 700 who work in the shuttle operation. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has said he would like to have the current <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees on the shuttle remain at their jobs.

 The charismatic leader of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s latest military insurrection, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON>, once rejected a medal for his service in the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> war because his troops were defeated. Friends and colleagues interviewed Friday described <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON>, who was trained in part at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, as a widely respected officer known for ultranationalist political views. The 54-year-old officer led at least 400 backers, who holed up in an army base outside the capital Friday and battled government troops. <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> was born a Moslem of Syrian-Lebanese parents but converted to Roman Catholicism. A superior once described him as `` holding the fanaticism of a convert'' in all his endeavors. Despite a distinguished military career, <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> was passed over for promotion to brigadier general last year and faced the prospect of eventual forced retirement. He said Friday he was not seeking to overthrow <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s constitutional government `` but to restore military honor to the army. <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> said he also wanted a review of trials `` that punish the just and promote the guilty.'' It was an apparent reference to trials of military officers accused of human rights violations during efforts by military governments in the 1970s to put down leftist subversion. <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> has denied involvement in the disappearance of about 9,000 Argentines during the anti-leftist campaign. After spending the last four years in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, first as Argentine military attache and then as an instructor to the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> was believed to have returned to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> on Thursday via neighboring <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> to lead the revolt. He was eager to come home, his wife <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Labiau </PERSON> told the private news agency DyN in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, `` because it was beginning to look like he had been sent into exile.'' <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> was born Nov. 12, 1934, in the town of <LOCATION> Concepcion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, 140 miles north of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. His father was a businessman and citrus grower. A graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> Argentine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, he rose rapidly in rank, specializing in infantry commando tactics. He was assigned to lead commandos on the Argentina-Chile border in 1978 when the two neighbors nearly went to war in a dispute over three tiny islands. Promoted to colonel, <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> led a commando unit that participated in the occupation of the British-held <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> on April 2, 1982. The Argentines, who call the islands the <LOCATION> Malvinas </LOCATION>, were defeated by a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> task force 74 days later. When <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> was called to testify in human rights abuses trials in 1984, troops formerly under his command gathered outside the court to cheer him and shouted, `` We'll go back to the Malvinas!''

 A hearing on the crash of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141 closed Friday with <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials asked why their agency took weeks to distribute a safety bulletin for takeoff warning systems. The Delta 727 crashed on takeoff Aug. 31 at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, claiming 14 lives. Much of the probe has turned on whether the plane's flaps were properly set for takeoff, and whether a flap alarm system worked. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> flight standards officer <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Tollision </PERSON> was asked why his office had taken weeks to distribute to <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> officials a bulletin telling them to immediately service their takeoff warning systems on <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s and 737s. The warning was prompted by the crash of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 255 in <LOCATION> Romulus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> in 1987. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, principal operations inspector for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s southern region that oversees <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, told the public hearing Thursday his office had received the bulletin `` on Aug. 30, or so. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141 crashed Aug. 31 claiming 14 lives. The hearing concluded Friday night after about 33 hours of testimony in which <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators interviewed experts in an effort to gather infromation that might find a cause of the crash. Board member <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> will continue the investigation although the hearing has concluded. The federal agency continue accepting any new evidence until it drafts a final report on the crash in about six months. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Alger </PERSON> dated Sept. 15, 1988, notifying him of `` aircarrier operations bulletin No. 8-884, takeoff warning systems checks.'' `` The accident in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> has focused the nation on the takeoff warning system; therefore, we are requesting a little more than your usual prompt reply,'' said <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> in his letter to <PERSON> Alger </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said in response to questions that `` sometimes it does take a while to distribute information to working levels, to my level,'' and explained he did n't specifically know how the June 17 letter was routed. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said the bulletin would have been relayed through several offices and reviewed by several individuals. `` I'm not sure we call it a dead letter,'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilot </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said his group was investigating whether the delay in spreading notice of the inspections was normal or unusual. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> also noted that the issue may only be on the periphery of the public hearing. `` The testing is irrelevant to this investigation only if it was a no-flap situation,'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said. `` We continue to dispute this assertion.'' <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> has steadfastly maintained during the federal inquiry that the three-man <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> crew, who testified earlier, were the victims of a split-flap configuation in which the plane's outer flaps are extended or in place for a takeoff while the inner flaps were not. A <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> aerodynamics engineer testified earlier that he believes <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141, given its recorded speed, could have achieved flight even with no flaps.

 Step into the mysterious, windowless Blue Cube, where 2,000 engineers and scientists working furiously with old, slow computers will soon have a new task _ tracking and controlling the $ 500 million spy satellite to be deployed by Atlantis. Giant screens, rows of terminals and bulky machines fill a warehouse-size room in the military's ultra-secret satellite tracking center, receiving millions of bits of coded information each second on the location and operation of hundreds of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and foreign satellites. The Cube can order one of the more than 50 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military satellites to snap photos of suspected troop movements and drop off the film in a parachute package to an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plane for a midair pickup. It can adjust a satellite's orbit, solar energy panels, cameras or other gear. Special attention is focused now on the new `` bird'' to be placed in orbit Saturday by the shuttle, a radar satellite code-named Lacrosse that is designed to spy on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and guide the stealth bomber. The Cube, officially called the Consolidated Space Test Center, is run by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in the heart of <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Next door are the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missiles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc Neither journalists nor others without top security clearance are allowed past the high fences and armed guards surrounding the pale blue building. However, interviews with <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials with access to the Cube, all of whom asked not to be identified, reveal a beehive of activity as a crack team of physicists, electrical and mechanical engineers and computer scientists cope with a crush of signals to and from satellites. `` The adrenalin flows, you work 18 hours a day, but you do n't feel tired at all,'' said one veteran of several satellite launches `` You suffer battle fatigue when it's over, but during the mission people get really hyped. This is their time and they're going to make it work. When you run into obstacles because the system is clumsy, just sheer energy makes it happen.'' The Cube has been in operation since 1959, virtually from the start of the space program. Despite the expenditure of several hundred million dollars to upgrade the computer and data distribution system over the past six years, most of the computers in the Cube are two or three generations old. They are reliable workhorses, built by <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and others in the 1970s and early 1980s, but are much slower, less efficient and more expensive to run than newer models at many companies in <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Instead of state of the art, the Cube's tubes and software programs remain `` antiquated,'' one systems expert said, because of government procurement policies. `` <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the military are stuck in this Catch-22,'' the systems expert said. `` It's hard to sell missions and get money. So people have to design minimal systems that use equipment from past missions, and they end up putting systems in place that are terribly engineered.'' He added, though, that `` very exceptional people at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the military make the system work despite the system.'' Until a few years ago, the Cube was the nation's only control center for military satellites, a place so secret that officials used to deny even its existence. Located within bazooka range of two highways and close to three earthquake faults, the Cube's vulnerability led to a $ 3.5 billion overhaul to bring it up to date and build a command center with similar capabilities at <ORGANIZATION> Falcon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. Those two centers are linked to eight <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> tracking sites around the world, including <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, as well as other <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> stations and a main ground station at <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sands </LOCATION>, N.M The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System, or TDRSS, is used to keep watch over all satellites, friendly and unfriendly, and any other `` space junk'' or debris from defunct satellites that could get in their way. TDRSS West, a satellite in orbit 22,000 miles over the western <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was the main tracker in space until September, when the shuttle Discovery placed TDRSS East in geosynchronous orbit 22,000 miles over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. For the launch of the new spy satellite, the military and civilian teams in the Cube and in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> will take over control of the satellite from <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> once they get the word `` the bird is in orbit.'' Because of secrecy requirements, nearly all the information from the TDRSS satellites and the spy satellite is fully encrypted. The ground station at <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sands </LOCATION>, a huge computer complex that is perhaps the most modern communications facility in the world, receives the information on two bands: C-band at 56,000 bits per second and KU-band at 300 million bits per second. The system can run several channels of each band simultaneously, taking in a total of more than a billion bits of information per second. The signals are then broken up into multiple channels at lower rates easier to handle, rebroadcast back up to military satellites and down again to the Cube and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, where they are monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> round the clock. The first job after the shuttle drops off the spy satellite is to order the firing of positioning rockets to stabilize the satellite in orbit. The exact position and type of orbit are secret, although some experts call such secrecy `` a silly game,'' since Soviet tracking stations can tell where all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellites are anyway.

 People who stumbled gasping and choking out of a deadly cloud of gas that leaked from the Union Carbide pesticide plant four years ago are still dying. The official death toll from the world's worst industrial disaster has reached 3,329. About 20,000 survivors still suffer from the effects of the Dec. 3, 1984, gas leak, and officials say at least one of them dies every day. `` I have spent more time in hospitals than at home in the last four years,'' said 15-year-old <PERSON> Sunil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON>, who lost his parents and five brothers and sisters to the gas. He and his younger brother and sister live on the $ 4,730 they received from the government in compensation for the deaths of the rest of their family. Other gas sufferers have been less fortunate. A 60-year-old woman who identifies herself only as <PERSON> Hakiman </PERSON> said she has been unable to get financial assistance because she could not provide an address. She said she survives by selling empty medicine bottles she finds on a trash dump near <LOCATION> Jawaharlal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nehru </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. At night she sleeps on the hospital grounds. `` The government tells me that if I had a home, I would have gotten some money as assistance,'' she said. `` But I need money to build a home.'' <PERSON> Sunil </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hakiman </PERSON> and other gas victims complain of shortness of breath and eye problems. `` The worst effect has been on the eyes and lungs, although there are numerous cases of total physical impairment,'' said a <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The government has issued strict instructions to doctors and officials to make none of their findings public while <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s $ 3 billion damage suit against <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> is pending. The suit, filed in 1986, has bogged down in the courts. As is common in Indian legal cases, no quick end is in sight, although the government tried to step up the pressure a year ago by filing murder charges against former <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and other company officials. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and the others have not responded to summonses. A year ago, the government of <LOCATION> Madhya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION>, the state that includes <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>, put the gas leak death toll at 2,850. It has recorded an additional 479 deaths in the last 12 months. `` We are registering more than one death per day because of the effects of the gas,'' said Gas Relief Commissioner <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sathyam </PERSON>, whose department records complaints and helps gas victims. Most of the victims lived in the shantytowns that popped up outside <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> and other industries moved to the central Indian city. An estimated 250,000 people _ one-fourth of <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>'s population _ inhabit the shantytowns and nearby slums that were in the path of the toxic cloud that formed when liquid methyl isocyanate leaked from a storage tank and turned into gas. The cloud hit the air at 1 a.m while most people were asleep. After the magnitude of the disaster became known, volunteer groups sprang up with the avowed aim of helping the victims. One of these groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Poisonous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, won court acceptance to become a third party in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s suit against <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> and its Indian subsidiary. `` Nobody is serious about the case,'' said <PERSON> Vibhuti </PERSON> <PERSON> Jha </PERSON>, the front's lawyer. `` It is essential that the victims get compensation at the earliest. We just can not allow the case to go on.'' However, most of the volunteer groups and opposition political parties do not want an out-of-court settlement. `` We want multinational companies, which thrive on business in Third World countries, to be taught a lesson and forced to adhere to safety requirements,'' said <PERSON> Balkrishna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>. Union Carbide, based in <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, says the gas leak resulted from sabotage by a disgruntled employee at the plant run by the Indian subsidiary. The Indian government maintains the leak was a result of negligence. So far, the most tangible relief for gas sufferers has been free medical care and government payments of $ 675 to next of kin for each person who died soon after the disaster. Many survivors say they are waiting for money from <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>. But some, like <PERSON> Sunil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON>, say financial compensation is not so important. `` We want to see <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> punished for what it has done to our lives,'' the teen-ager said.

 Atlantis' twin booster rockets were heading back to land by way of sea today after helping send the shuttle into space. Two ships towed the twin boosters toward <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, near the Kennedy Space Center, after they were recovered in rough seas 160 miles out in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. They dropped with parachutes within eight miles of the recovery ships after Friday morning's successful launch, the second since the Challenger disaster blamed on booster rockets. `` Everything appeared to be very nominal -LRB- normal -RRB-. There appeared to be no external leakage or anything like that,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a motor technical assistant for the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> who came to Kennedy Space Center for the launch. Divers from the recovery ships took a quick look at the boosters, tossed in rough seas with winds of 20 to 30 knots, and saw no obvious damage, said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Diller </PERSON>. The divers removed the parachutes that slowed the boosters' plummet, then attached flotation devices and cables from the 149-foot boosters to the two recovery ships and began removing pockets of water, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said The 200,000-pound steel casings were expected at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> this afternoon. After cleaning and other work here, they will be returned to the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> plant of manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for inspection and refitting. The boosters have drawn close attention since their failure was blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger explosion that killed all seven astronauts aboard. The <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that investigated the disaster said a booster O-ring that failed to seal in cold weather allowed flame to escape and ignited the main fuel tank. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 800 million to make 145 changes in the booster design and for testing before the Discovery launch Sept. 29. The massive rockets have 11 major components and are manufactured in four segments joined at the seams. `` There are so many parts, so many things that could go wrong,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. But he added, `` I was not nearly as apprehensive'' as he was during the Discovery launch. `` On that one, there was a lot of apprehension. I stood there and cried.'' When fully loaded with 1.1 million pounds of propellant, each booster weighs 1.3 million pounds and produces 3.3 million pounds of thrust that give the orbiter 80 percent of the power needed to lift it from the launch pad into orbit.

They stepped off the plane clutching bags stuffed with money, then dumped coins and paper bills onto the tarmac to show they were n't carrying explosives.

 A quadriplegic woman who says she makes $ 2,000 a week playing an electric organ with her mouth is challenging the city's anti-begging ordinance so she can continue her Boardwalk performances in front of casinos. <PERSON> Celestine </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing was postponed Friday, but her lawyers said they were confident they can reach an out-of-court agreement with the city.

Birth defects left her arms and legs undeveloped, and family members move her on a gurney. Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said she averages $ 2,000 a week, enough to send her two daughters to private school. In the past several years, she has accumulated dozens of summonses from police enforcing this gambling resort's anti-begging ordinance. On Friday, she was in court to face 23 more.

<HEAD>Giant Deal Shows High Bid Can Lose, Brazen Greed Provokes Hostility</HEAD>

 A Wall Street buyout artist's victory over a tough company executive in the struggle for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has reshaped the rules for debt-financed jumbo takeovers, showing dramatically that the fattest bid does n't always win and flagrant greed can backfire. Moreover, the hostility and controversy aroused by the conduct of chief executive <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in his dogged pursuit of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> reflects heightened concerns about potential conflicts of interest when managers try to buy their companies. Some even say the fallout from this deal could dampen the enthusiasm for future management-led takeovers. Particularly troubling to many management strategists, and to the company's directors as well, were <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s initial buy-low approach, his extravagant built-in rewards in the takeover plan and his evident disregard for the fate of most of the cigarette and food giant's 120,000 employees. Despite the <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> group's final $ 112-a-share, $ 25.2 billion offer, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> directors chose the $ 109-a-share, $ 24.5 billion alternative from <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the unchallenged leader in debt-financed takeovers. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s victory marked the biggest takeover in history and capped a tumultuous struggle for the nation's 19th largest industrial company, which transfixed the financial world, incited congressional scrutiny and intensified concerns about the growing piles of debt burdening the American economy through the growing popularity of so-called leveraged buyouts. Although many lessons will be learned from this classic Wall Street brawl, the ones that will most likely grab the attention of managers contemplating their own leveraged buyouts are <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s mistakes `` I think one lesson they can draw is not to think they have a lock on the deal because they are the experienced managers and that they know the business,'' said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Veale </PERSON>, finance division manager of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a leading training and education group in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Another thing is, this very well may be a signal that boards of directors believe managements have to pay closer attention to employees,'' <PERSON> Veale </PERSON> said. Post-mortem accounts of the Kohlberg-Johnson struggle show <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> directors were impressed with the buyout firm's commitment to minimize disruption to the company, while <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was determined to sell everything except the tobacco business to pay off the giant debt he would assume in the deal. The board also appreciated <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s sensitivty to <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> workers, while <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s offer barely mentioned them. `` Ordinarily, boards in the past have taken the position that they'll accept the offer with the best return to shareholders,'' <PERSON> Veale </PERSON> said. `` This is the first one of significant size where they did n't reach that determination.'' To be sure, at least some shareholders will be angry over what on its face value is a lower purchase price for their stock. Predictions already are flying that <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> directors will face numerous lawsuits over their disregard of the so-called business judgment rule, by accepting the cheaper of two offers. But some management and takeover experts say that anger is misguided, since <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s group started with a bid of $ 75 per share. Where, they ask, was <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s obligation to maximize value to the shareholders when he offered that price? `` I think the real villain in this whole process was Mr. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Yakov </PERSON> <PERSON> Amihud </PERSON>, a finance professor at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, who has just written a book about management-led takeovers. `` He was the insider with the information. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> was the outsider without the information. The knight that saved the stockholders was <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION>, because if they did n't get into it, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> would have walked away with it for $ 75,'' <PERSON> Amihud </PERSON> said. `` Stockholders should be thankful to <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Galante </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Buyout </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION>, which tracks trends in debt-financed takeovers, said he believed the RJR saga will help `` force management to recognize that a responsible board is n't going to let management get away with a low bid. Management should n't low-ball it.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Galante </PERSON>, said, the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> takeover also provided some useful lessons to directors. The objective bidding process that collapsed into a free-for-all auction with extended deadlines and last-minute haggling was something that other boards will likely avoid, he said. `` I think the board in this case was trying to strike a strong degree of independence, and show it was going to put the company up to the highest bidder,'' <PERSON> Galante </PERSON> said. `` It turned out to be a fiasco. It created all this bidding with a lot of uncertainty about whether the deals could be financed.'' Ultimately, it may have been <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s supremacy in financing other takeovers that led <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s directors to believe going with the investment firm's offer was more responsible. `` If you were on a buyout team, would you rather be on <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s side or the other side?,'' said <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayn </PERSON>, a mergers-and-acquisitions professor at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> business `` <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION> has a lot more familiarity and the financial resources to at least ride out any downturn. Where does <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> go for money?'' Even though <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> presumably knew his business better than an outsider, Ms. <PERSON> Hayn </PERSON> said, `` It's cheaper to buy a new CEO than to arrange financing. If I had to cast my stakes, even if <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> did offer the lower price, I'd be going with someone that has gone through these kind of transactions before.''

 In the closing weeks of 1988, Wall Streeters are still groping for the right prescription to reinvigorate a stock market that has languished all year. While the market's maladies have resisted all remedies, they have not turned out as severe as they threatened to become after the crash in October 1987. After all, barring a sudden sharp drop this month, stock prices will close out this year, as they did last year, showing a net gain. But that prospect stirred little elation among the brokers who gathered here this past week for the annual convention of their principal trade group, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Trading volume in all markets remains down, depressing a prime source of the Street's revenues. Individual investors are still opting for the safe haven of certificates of deposit or money market funds and shunning stocks. In addition, the gains the market has managed to record have stemmed largely from takeover and buyout activity like the bidding war for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> that has dominated recent financial headlines. Whatever short-term benefits buyouts bring to brokers and their customers, most analysts agree they have by no means solved the problem of restoring confidence in the market. On the contrary, they have raised fears of new shocks when the superstructure of debt created by the buyouts is sooner or later tested in a business downturn. `` In the long term, I think it's unhealthy for the markets,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardiman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>, which supervises the over-the-counter market. Scandals over insider trading and other abuses also still cloud the outlook. `` There is the matter of industry image, or reputation, or integrity _ call it what you will,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is undeniable that it has been tarnished in the past few years.'' While <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> argued that some criticisms of Wall Street's behavior have gone beyond what is justified, he also acknowledged that they have stung `` In my view, there is no magic potion that can be taken to produce a happy new world, and national media campaigns are not the answer,'' he said. Then, too, there is the question of whether investigations and reform measures since the 1987 market collapse have done enough to restore faith in the mechanism of the marketplace itself. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, thinks not. He urged that the new administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appoint a commission to do a long-term study of the markets. More than 13 months after the fact, he said, `` I do n't think anyone understands last October.'' Those who hold out hope for revived enthusiasm in the near future say their conviction lies in the very caution and pessimism that are so prevalent now. They point to measures of investment advisory sentiment that have lately turned as gloomy as at any time since just before the start of the 1982-87 bull market. And indeed, adherents of this school of `` contrary opinion'' made their presence felt in the past week's trading activity. The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 industrials rose 17.60 to 2,092.28. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index gained 2.39 to 153.02; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market added 7.53 to 373.91; and the Amex market value index was up 4.08 to 295.27. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 132.54 million shares a day, against 107.86 million the previous week. With so much money stockpiled in CDs and money market investments, a drop in interest rates might well give stocks a big lift, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> brokerage executive who was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> the past two years. In the crash, he said, `` the public was bruised and frightened, but not broken. I suspect we could have a surprisingly good year in 1989.''
