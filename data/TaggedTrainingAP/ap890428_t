<HEAD>Report: Iraq Downed Egyptian Jet By Mistake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Iraqi soldier shot down an Egyptian jet fighter by mistake last week as it descended to land in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> for an air show, a published report here said. The two Egyptian fliers ejected safely before the plane crashed, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Friday's editions. The Iraqi government had invited <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to fly its home-built Alpha fighter-bomber to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> for the air show, but apparently word of the invitation had not reached the soldier who, armed with shoulder-fired missile, downed the unfamiliar jet, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The newspaper cited secret intelligence reports making the rounds of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government offices here as the source of the story. The Alpha jet was developed by French and German aircraft firms. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has purchased Alpha kits from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and assembles the fighter-bomber in a plant south of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. The jet has a top speed of 600 mph. Two years ago, in another case of mistaken identity, an Iraqi pilot in a Mirage F1 bomber shot two Exocet missiles into the USS Stark, killing 37 sailors aboard the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Iraqi officials said the pilot mistook the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ship for an Iranian vessel. Also, the USS Vincennes downed an Iranian Airbus on July 3, 1988, killing 290 people, as it flew over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships were protecting neutral ships during the Iran-Iraq war. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it attempted repeatedly to contact the plane for identification, and when it got no response, the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> destroyed the plane with a surface-to-air missile.

 The miniseries comes to `` Mister <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' Neighborhood'' next week, and the show's cardigan-clad creator promises a message as gentle and reassuring as ever The three-part musical, titled `` <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> the Short-Neck Giraffe,'' tells the story of a young giraffe who yearns for a long, graceful neck like all the other giraffes. She eventually grows, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> confided, `` not on the outside, but on the important side.'' `` It's very much like the usual message of the Neighborhood, that you can be acceptable as you are,'' he said, smiling. `` It's not so much the outsides of us that are important. A song sung by <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> and her friend <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> the elephant sums it up best, according to <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>. `` You're much more than a neck, <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON>. And you're much more than a trunk, <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON>. A chicken's more than a peck, and there's more than a smell to a skunk,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> quietly sang during an interview at <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s WQED-TV, home to his children's programs for the past 35 years. The special week of new programs gets under way Monday on <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> stations with a trip to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wild </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Animal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where viewers are introduced to real-life giraffes and elephants. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> visits a film processing lab to have his animal photographs developed. The miniseries, which features a cast of 15, elaborate animal costumes and five sets, runs Wednesday through Friday. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> gently guides his young audience from one day to the next, summarizing the main events and hinting at what might lie ahead for <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON>. In the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, where animals sing, dance and play the trombone, <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> is befriended by <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON>, a shy giraffe who overcomes his problems by helping <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> conquer hers. He accomplishes that with help from <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> the elephant, who advises him to `` just let your heart speak.'' `` There is n't a time that I see the scene in which <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> talks and sings with <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> ... that I have n't gotten chills up my spine,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said, tapping his right hand against his back. `` And this is something I've worked with for years. There's something so redemptive about someone who is trying so hard to help somebody else. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>, 61, wrote `` <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> the Short-Neck Giraffe'' for a French class assignment at <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Rollins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in 1950. He named <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> the giraffe after fraternity brother <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON>, who went on to sing with the Metropolitan Opera and was a frequent guest on `` Mister Rogers Neighborhood.'' <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> died a year ago, and the miniseries is dedicated to him. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> set the story to music in the late 1950s, and about 1,000 records were pressed. Writer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Head </PERSON> transformed `` <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> the Short-Neck Giraffe'' into a poem for children in 1975. For years, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> tried to have the musical produced on stage or as an animated film. `` I still think it would be great for animation and a stage production,'' he said. `` But I thought unless we get it out on the air, I do n't think anybody's going to know about it.'' The story <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> wrote 39 years ago is vastly different from the musical airing next week. It is the Neighborhood's 13th musical. `` At the end of the -LRB- original -RRB- story, when people are telling <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> that they like her just the way she is, she raises her head to look at them because she has n't really heard this message before and her neck starts to grow. And it grows and grows and grows until her neck is as tall as everybody else's,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. In the musical, <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON>'s neck remains short. `` I think it shows how much we've grown,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. `` You know, you do n't have to look like everybody else to be acceptable and to feel acceptable. And wishes do n't always come true. `` Because for a year and a day I've been wishing, she sang. That was one of her first songs. Her wish was for a longer neck, she thought. But really her wish was to have people like her exactly as she is. So often what we say we're wishing for is n't necessarily what is behind the wish. This is very philosophical.'' Will pre-schoolers be able to grasp such a serious message, even in such a light-hearted setting? `` Maybe not in words, but let their hearts speak to them the way <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> said to <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON>, ` Just let your heart speak,''' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. `` I think that that's the way an awful lot of communication takes place.''

 `` Frere Jacques'' never sounded so revolutionary. `` Lying to the people, lying to the people, very strange, very strange,'' hundreds of students sang in place of the usual lyrics of the French children's song. Unlike American anti-Vietnam War marchers of the 1960s, who were serenaded by a generation of rock and folk singers, thousands of Chinese students who marched for democracy have a limited repertoire of marching songs. Most of the time they stick to the national anthem, with its stirring call to the masses to `` arise,'' or the Internationale, the theme song of the international communist movement. But they mix it up a bit with `` Frere Jacques'' and the nursery rhyme `` Baa Baa Black Sheep.'' Only the words were different. `` We did n't have time to write our own songs,'' said one student leader. `` Besides, it's easier to sing when you know the tune.''

 Police kept their cool but some lost their hats and shoes in skirmishes with students who pushed through their lines toward <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. When the dust settled after the students pushed through the first line of police, one officer was seen wandering around in his socks, wailing, `` My shoes, my shoes.'' An old woman finally found one of his black cloth shoes and returned it. A student later produced another. In the final standoff before students surged into Tiananmen Square, one worker snatched the hat off an officer's head and tossed it into the crowd. Someone caught it and tossed it back like a frisbee. The officer's arms were linked with his comrades to form a human barricade, so a student politely plunked it back on the policeman's head

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a model to many of the students. One student described <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, the ousted <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader whose death sparked the recent protests, as `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>.'' Another said American student protests in the 1960s against the Vietnam War inspired him and his classmates to take to the streets, despite the fact that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at that time was <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Enemy No 1. The question most often asked by students was: `` Do n't <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students demonstrate, too?''

 The first thing the people noticed was the tinkling of a bell, then a shaved head and finally a gray robe. A <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk had come to the demonstration. Walking slowly, shaking his prayer bell, the monk blessed the crowd, which parted before him. `` I feel in my heart for you, all of us support you,'' he said. `` Religion has suffered much in this country. I had to thank you for supporting freedom.''

 Many of the bystanders carried cameras, anxious for souvenirs of the rare day. But good views were hard to get in the constantly moving crowd, forcing some dedicated photographers to climb trees and bus stop signs. One middle-aged man handed his camera to a youth standing on a bicycle and pleaded with him to `` snap the whole roll.'' The roof of one shanty crumbled under the weight of camera-happy spectators and they came crashing down in a cloud of dust. The crowd roared with laughter and nobody seemed hurt.

 Most of the police who withdrew in the face of the huge, insistent crowd did so gracefully. About 50 police who had been roughly pushing back bystanders on a side street abruptly formed a line and trotted off down the street. The crowd shouted, `` Thank you'' and surged forward. A few traffic police caught up in the melee simply took off their uniform white cross-chest straps and belts, climbed over a fence and melted into the crowd. Other police crouched on their haunches at the side of the road, heads in their hands, and smiled wearily as the crowd passed.

 What makes a successful entreprenuer? A recent <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> survey reports that many are immigrants, the offspring of self-employed parents and hold advanced degrees. The survey of 99 <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> graduates who will be honored by the university Saturday night provides some insight into the men and women who give upthe security of a salary to take a chance on their own business. As part of the institute's 128th anniversary, it will honor the 99 sociology consultants, financial managers and computer technicians for their `` hard work, foresight and courage.'' Collectively, they have created 100,000 jobs in the state and 250,000 worldwide in fields that range from women's apparel to geotechnical engineering. The cumulative sales of their companies total $ 25 billion annually. According to the survey, 73 percent earned an educational degree above the bachelor level, and 33 percent went on to doctorate or post-doctorate work. Sixteen percent founded their companies while they were still at school, 34 percent set up shop within five years of graduating and 23 percent opened for business between six years and 10 years after graduation. Two percent founded their companies more than 20 years after graduation. The survey said more than half were the children of parents who founded their own companies. Many of the companies had inauspicious beginnings in basements or rough neighborhoods with minimal staff and equipment. But some of the entrepreneurs had more colorful starts. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Abt </PERSON>, founder of the social sciences consulting firm <ORGANIZATION> Abt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, built ship models and sold them to <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> when he was only 12. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> `` Doc'' <PERSON> Edgerton </PERSON>, whom the institute called `` the father of flash photography,'' attempted to market his first strobe equipment through <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> was n't interested The three most important lessons the entrepreneurs said <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> taught them were problem solving, the importance of hard work, confidence and the belief that anything is possible. And when these busy people take the time to relax and enjoy success, most said they enjoyed tennis, skiing, sailing, music and art and reading. In the advice department, the entrepreneurs recommend that aspiring business adventurers begin by identifying a market opportunity and matching it with an appropriate technology, select partners with talents that complement their own and remember that the success of the enterprise rests with the performance of its employees.

<HEAD>Another Scientist Sees Evidence of Possible Cold Fusion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new experiment confirms observations from the controversial cold fusion research announced last month, giving `` very encouraging'' evidence for fusion, a scientist says. The new experiment generated more power than it consumed and showed two other signs of possible fusion, said researcher <PERSON> Uziel </PERSON> <PERSON> Landau </PERSON>. But results so far are only preliminary and `` we stop short of saying that we see fusion,'' said <PERSON> Landau </PERSON>, a professor of chemical engineering at <ORGANIZATION> Case </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. Fusion is the nuclear reaction that powers the sun, and some scientists hope to harness it as an environmentally benign power source. It occurs when the cores of two hydrogen atoms fuse. Last month, researchers announced at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> that they had produced fusion at room temperature with a simple apparatus. Conventional fusion research uses extremely high temperatures and complex machinery. Since the announcement, some scientists have reported similar results while others said their attempts to confirm the work failed. <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> worked with two large test tubes, each containing a small palladium rod to act as one electrode, and a titanium-coated platinum mesh to serve as the other. The electrodes were placed in a bath of so-called heavy water, in which hydrogen is replaced by a chemical cousin called deuterium. The liquid also contained lithium, <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> said Thursday in an interview. According to proponents of cold fusion, the reaction occurs in one of the electrodes when current is applied. <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> said his apparatus produced three possible signs of fusion. One was that the apparatus gave off 8 percent to 30 percent more power than it consumed, with the output given off as heat, he said. The apparatus also produced bursts of extremely tiny particles called neutrons. And the heavy water solution showed about a doubling of its initial concentration of tritium, which is a form of hydrogen, <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> said he did not test for production of helium, a product of fusion. Future experiments will use ordinary water rather than heavy water, <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> said. Scientists say that can help rule out the possibility that a chemical reaction, rather than a nuclear reaction, produced the experimental results.

 When organizers at <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> invited <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to give a speech last month, fewer than one-fourth of the 10,000 tickets were sold in advance and the former president agreed to waive his $ 50,000 fee. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who commanded vast audiences until he left office in January ago, is now out of the limelight, retired into the select club of former presidents that includes <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. Occasionally, the former president pops back into the news. Both President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> visited him this week in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. And his name came up more negatively in repeated references during the Iran-Contra trial of former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. Would one have expected a less reclusive retirement given <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s popularity during his two-term tenure? Probably not, agree president watchers. They differ, however, on whether it's the nature of the man or the nature of the system which is responsible. `` It's not unusual and not at all atypical historically for a former president to slip from sight,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a presidential scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, an independent think tank. The advent of a new president is accompanied by a flurry of media attention and public curiosity, <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said, and the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> occupant generally just drifts away from power, <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, 78, works in his offices atop a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> skyscraper, say his aides. He writes speeches on such favorite topics as the need for a line-item veto, a balanced budget amendment and an end to the two-term limit for presidents. He has joined the board of the conservative magazine <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> and also is planning to write his memoirs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been virtually mum on the presidency of his successor, and he is rarely mentioned in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. One way for former presidents to step back into the limelight is to take a shot at their predecessor. Thus, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> made the news in 1981 when he criticized <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget proposal for placing too much emphasis on defense spending and not enough on domestic programs. `` But most ex-presidents are obliging and they stay out of the hair of the current occupant of 1600 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON>, a professor of government at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has been careful to avoid criticism of his predecessor. Last month, White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> admonished aides to refrain from unfavorable comparisons of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Some former presidents have made a comeback several years later, returning to vogue once a historical perspective of their presidency has been established. Such was the case with <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, who left office in 1953 an unpopular leader but was seen in a far more favorable light in the 1960s and until he died in 1972. Presidents who can not bear the obscurity of retirement are rare. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> did n't want to be an ex-president so he ran against fellow Republican <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> in 1912. His run split the Republican vote, and gave Democrat <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> the White House. `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is not about to upstage <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Korologos </PERSON>, a lobbyist and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> friend who once served the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administrations as a legislative aide. `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did more for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> than any other president has done for his VP, and now he knows it's time to get out of the picture,'' he said <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON> and several other scholars and consultants believe <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides are particularly anxious that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> maintain a low profile for the time being. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lived in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s shadow for eight years. Now he needs to establish himself as an independent and distance himself in some ways,'' <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself does n't mention his predecessor very often as he seeks to move subtly away from some of the domestic and foreign policies known as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> legacy. For example, in reaching a compromise agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> effectively killed future military aid to the rebels _ a cause dear to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s heart. `` It's a mark of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s respect for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that he has bitten his lip and avoided statements even on the things he felt so passionately about like the Contras,'' said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Eizenstat </PERSON>, who served as <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s domestic policy adviser and is now a political consultant.

<HEAD>With PM-Soviet-Politics, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is an outline of the structure of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government: PARTY STRUCTURE: The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> holds political power in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has proposed changes that allow some contested elections to form a legislature that may exercise significant political power. The Communist Party's power is centered in the Politburo and the Secretariat of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which has 5,000 elected members, is supposed to be the party's supreme organ, and ordinarily meets every five years. The congress elects the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, made up of 250 to 300 of the country's top leaders. It now has 251 members. The Central Committee normally meets about twice a year to approve policies and formally elects the members of the Politburo and the Secretariat, the two highest party bodies. Since March 11, 1985, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> been general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, head of the Secretariat and leading member of the Politburo. Since Oct. 1, 1988, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also has been the nation's president, holding top party and government jobs
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 The Secretariat: This Communist Party body is responsible for running social and economic spheres as well as party personnel and ideology, and wields tremendous power over implementation of policy. Politburo membership and a seat on the secretariat traditionally have been considered necessary to gain the top party job. There are now 10 secretaries, including <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 The Politburo: <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> runs meetings of the Politburo, the party's most powerful body. It now has 12 full members and eight candidate, or non-voting, members. The Politburo normally meets every week.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE: The Supreme Soviet: The 1,500 members are elected from a single slate of approved candidates and theoretically make up the top government body in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But it has traditionally met only twice a year to ratify policy set by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Under a reform pushed through by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the Supreme Soviet will become a smaller body _ with about 500 members _ that meets several months a year. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> says he wants it to be more active, handling operational questions the party apparatus has assumed over the years and leaving the party to decide policy questions. But the Supreme Soviet has not met under the new format, and the extent of its powers is uncertain. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet: The presidium, which has 37 members, is the collective presidency that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> leads as chairman. Presidents of each of the 15 Soviet republics are members. The presidium has the power to issue government decrees when the Supreme Soviet, or parliament, is not in session. But the presence of Politburo and regional party leaders in its membership ensures its actions have prior top-level approval.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Council of Ministers: The council, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s Cabinet, is responsible for day-to-day operation of government ministries such as agriculture or transportation. It is headed by Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, a full member of the Politburo.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 CONGRESS OF PEOPLES DEPUTIES: The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> is a new 2,250-member body consisting of 1,500 deputies elected from geographical organizations and 750 elected from the party and its affiliates, social, professional and trade union organizations. The congress, which was elected in the first multicandidate balloting, is empowered to choose the president and the Supreme Soviet from among its members, amend the constitution, and review the president's choice for premier.

 Ostracized by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, confined to the city limits, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s top diplomat in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> leads a frustrating existence. <LOCATION> Miagol </LOCATION> _ the first, last and only name of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s charge d'affaires _ is hoping the recent pullout of 115,000 Soviet troops from his country will ease some of the isolation imposed on him by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But he is also realistic. The Soviet-educated economist invited Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to his embassy's reception Thursday evening marking the 11th anniversary of the revolution that brought to power a Marxist-oriented government and resulted in the 1979 Soviet invasion. `` They said he could n't come, unfortunately,'' <PERSON> Miagol </PERSON> said with a skeptical laugh. Very few Americans attended the reception, which drew mostly diplomats from Soviet bloc and other communist and socialist countries. For a man who has to ask permission every time he wants to leave the city _ and is usually turned down _ <PERSON> Miagol </PERSON> was remarkably cheerful at an interview in the resplendent red-brick mansion which doubles as residence and embassy. `` Physically our life is good,'' he said, `` but morale is difficult.'' <PERSON> Miagol </PERSON>, one of 15 children, does not know how old he is but estimates his age at about 40. `` My mother said there was snow on the ground, but she did n't know in what year,'' he said. <PERSON> Miagol </PERSON> arrived here 10 months ago with his <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> wife and two children. When he asked to travel to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by car to attend the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> last fall, he was told to go by plane. When he asked permission to drive to the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>'s recreation compound outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he was denied `` They said it was too far. But people from other socialist embassies also have 25-mile limit, and they are allowed to go,'' <PERSON> Miagol </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries impose 25-mile travel limits on diplomats from countries deemed unfriendly. `` This makes me nervous,'' <PERSON> Miagol </PERSON> said. He spends his days reading messages received by telex from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, dealing with administrative matters relating to his three-man embassy and keeping in touch with the extensive community of Afghan exiles in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. His only contact with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is through <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gookin </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Protocol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, whom he sees about twice a month. `` I give him my opinions,'' <PERSON> Miagol </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gookin </PERSON> listens politely _ `` he's a very nice man'' _ and conveys <PERSON> Miagol </PERSON>'s views to <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> experts. But <PERSON> Gookin </PERSON> refused to accept a written message from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s leader <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> congratulating <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his inauguration as president and expressing his hopes for improved relations, <PERSON> Miagol </PERSON> said. `` They told me to put the envelope in a window for letters'' at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, he said. <PERSON> Miagol </PERSON> said he used the same window to deliver a second message several weeks ago asking the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stop arming the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> rebels. The rebels, backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, fought the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> occupation for nine years and are now locked in a civil war with <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>'s Soviet-backed government. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to view <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> as a hardline Marxist and fails to see that he is gaining acceptance by Afghans as the only viable choice for leading the war-wracked country, <PERSON> Miagol </PERSON> said. `` They must learn from the mistakes of the Soviets, who did n't understand the Afghan people,'' <PERSON> Miagol </PERSON> said Neither the Soviets nor the Americans understand that Afghans can not embrace Marxism, he said. `` It is not right with our culture, with our religion,'' said the Soviet-educated Moslem. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> withheld recognition from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s government after the Soviets invaded, contending it was not elected democratically and does not represent the Afghan people However, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> continued to function in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, serving as a listening post in the Soviet-run country. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recognizes many governments that are not democratic, that are fascist dictatorships,'' <PERSON> Miagol </PERSON> said. At least <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> was elected to office _ `` maybe not like <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> elections,'' but in accordance with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s constitution, he said. Once, the Soviets were considered the bad guys in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the Americans were the good guys, <PERSON> Miagol </PERSON> said. Now, the Soviet tanks and troops have left and they are sending wheat, flour and oil, while the Americans send missiles to the Mujahedeen. `` If the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> continues this, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will of course be pro-Soviet,'' <PERSON> Miagol </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Budget Deal Eliminates Some, Not All, USDA Uncertainty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 1990 budget compromise worked out between the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month has eased some of the pressure for cutting farm subsidies but the turmoil is far from over. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> still has a way to go before settling on a spending package for the fiscal year that will begin Oct. 1, and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> budget experts say farm programs still are expected to be pared. The compromise reached two weeks ago calls for $ 2.4 billion to be whittled from agriculture functions that are covered in the federal budget, says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, deputy director of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s budget office Initially, he said Thursday in an interview, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget proposals were identical, calling for a $ 2.9 billion cut in fiscal 1990 for agriculture-related programs. The major target in the original Reagan-Bush budget proposals was the package of farm programs operated by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a variety of price and income support mechanisms that soared to record spending levels during the 1980s The CCC cuts alone would total $ 1.9 billion. To help <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> show less of a deficit on paper, part of that is to be accomplished administratively by paying about $ 800 million in advance `` deficiency'' payments to farmers early, so they show up on this year's budget rather than in the 1990 budget. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced the early payments on April 18, pointing out that the move would `` provide some extra money to farmers'' as they head for the fields this spring. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not mention that the move also would help reduce his 1990 budget deficit figure, the early payments had long been planned _ in both the initial <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget proposals _ as a way to save money next fiscal year. But that still left $ 1.1 billion to be cut from the CCC operations if the 1990 reduction goal of $ 1.9 billion for <ORGANIZATION> CCC </ORGANIZATION> was to be met. One of the simplist ways to cut CCC some more would be a further reduction in crop target prices used to compute payments to farmers. However, that would have required legislation by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to give <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> authority to tinker with the payment formula. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said the mid-April agreement between the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> calls for a CCC reduction next year of $ 600 million, or little more than half the $ 1.1 billion remaining to be cut. But a solution was found. As it turned out, $ 500 million in `` savings'' for 1990 would come from another change that will require legislation. This involves the financing of the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and would be used to offset further reductions in CCC costs. For many years the <ORGANIZATION> FCA </ORGANIZATION> enjoyed independent status as a federal agency, and its annual spending was `` off budget'' and not counted in the government's overall balance sheet of receipts and outlays. But after the farm credit problems of the 1980s forced <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to crack down on the huge system of federal land banks, production credit associations and other institutions overseen by <ORGANIZATION> FCA </ORGANIZATION>, the agency's budget has been part of the regular process. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said that although <ORGANIZATION> FCA </ORGANIZATION> is not part of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, it is part of the `` agriculture function'' used in budget planning. Thus, it was agreed during the compromise deliberations to move <ORGANIZATION> FCA </ORGANIZATION> once again `` off budget'' and thereby `` save'' $ 500 million. So, with $ 800 million shuffled from one year to another and $ 500 million moved off budget, that leaves $ 600 million in cuts for next year's CCC programs still to be made to reach the $ 1.9 billion in cuts for next year. Exactly how remains to be settled. Additionally, <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said, the compromise calls for releasing $ 500 million from a food stamp account held y the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, a fund that has been building up since food stamps were initiated in the early 1960s. The money accumulated because some stamps are lost, destroyed, forgotten or otherwise not used to buy groceries. They were never redeemed, although the government still has cash on hand just in case. By releasing the food stamp account, the government will have use of the money _ and the 1990 budget can be trimmed by a further $ 500 million, making a total `` savings'' of $ 2.4 billion claimed by the negotiators. Some have complained that the budget cutters may target their work too much on farm programs, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said on April 18 that while agriculture `` has taken a hit, so has a wide array of programs across the board. And I think what we've done here is fair.'' Others have said <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> farm programs could stand even further pruning, pointing out that spending on those programs is still high although there have been sharp reductions in recent years. In 1984, for example, CCC spending on commodity programs _ including feed grains, wheat, rice, cotton, tobacco, dairy, soybeans, honey and wool _ was about $ 7.32 billion. In 1985, costs jumped to $ 17.7 billion and then rose to a record $ 25.8 billion in 1986. Commodity program spending dropped to $ 22.4 billion in 1987 and since has declined to an estimated $ 13.8 billion this year.

 The outlaw Snow White has disappeared and the copyright lawsuits have been shelved, but the real impact of the 61st Academy Awards has not diminished in the month since the curtain fell on the glitzy ceremony. `` Rain Man,'' winner of five major trophies, including best picture, has enjoyed a record-breaking post-Oscar surge, and a number of lesser victors have profited handsomely from their awards. `` Rain Man,'' the reigning domestic box-office champion with revenues of $ 156 million, is now <ORGANIZATION> MGM-United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION>' highest-grossing film ever, and is expected to be its biggest international hit, too Meanwhile, best foreign film winner `` Pelle the Conqueror'' is selling tickets at a brisk pace across the country, and sales for best original song `` Let the River Run'' from `` Working Girl'' have skyrocketed. `` A Fish Called <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON>,'' which won an Oscar for best supporting actor, is No. 1 on the home video-rental charts. Most post-Oscar publicity focused on the Oscar telecast's opening production number in which an unauthorized Snow White impersonator presented material so strange Disney promptly sued for copyright infringement In addition, a group of 17 producers, actors, directors and writers complained to the Academy that the show, with all its hype and glitz, `` was an embarrassment to both the Academy and the entire motion picture industry.'' The note, dated two days after the March 29 show, was sent to <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> and the Academy's board of governors. `` It is neither fitting nor acceptable that the best work in motion pictures be acknowledged in such a demeaning fashion,'' said the letter, signed by <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Donen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Lumet </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and others. But the performance by `` Rain Man'' has transcended the flap over the telecast. `` Rain Man'' has taken in $ 127 million internationally, and the story of a scheming car salesman learning to love his autistic brother will likely surpass all of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION>' `` Rocky'' sequels and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> features in foreign receipts. `` A year ago, when we planned the release of this picture, we felt with the cast and the director and the story structure, that we had a major chance for Academy nominations and awards,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. `` So we planned the foreign release so that we would be breaking on the screens around the world at the time the nominations were announced and the awards were given. So the strategy worked perfectly and the picture has just bombarded the marketplace.'' `` Rain Man'' is now playing in more than 50 countries, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. In 6 -LCB- weeks of release in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, `` Rain Man'' has grossed in excess of $ 25 million. The movie's Oscar triumph _ it also won best actor for <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, best director for <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> and best original screenplay for <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> _ has boosted many of the film's related performers. <PERSON> Valeria </PERSON> <PERSON> Golino </PERSON>, the movie's co-star, now is inundated with scripts and has just completed the coming feature `` Torrents of Spring.'' For other movies that might have faded without any Oscar hype, the Academy Awards have given them a fresh jolt of momentum. `` Upon winning the Academy Award, we've found that a lot more people are interested in ` <PERSON> Pelle </PERSON>' and in -LRB- the film's star -RRB- <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, national sales manager for `` <PERSON> Pelle </PERSON> the Conqueror'' distributor <ORGANIZATION> Miramax </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said `` <PERSON> Pelle </PERSON>,'' with $ 1.9 million in the bank to date, is now playing in such cities as <LOCATION> Winsted </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Orem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, not bad for a 2 -LCB- - hour film about Swedish immigrants working on a turn-of-the-century farm and speaking not one word of English

<HEAD>Non-Working Senior Judges are Obstacle for Judicial Pay Raise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Five congressmen put a trio of leading judges on notice: the pay raise so vigorously sought by federal judges may well depend on denying it to senior judges who do no judicial work. `` Pay raises should be reserved for those who work,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> courts subcommittee His message was echoed by four <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> colleagues at a hearing Thursday. They were taken aback by testimony from the judicial leaders, who are seeking a 30 percent pay raise for all federal judges. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffin </PERSON> depicted a federal bench demoralized over the loss of a 51 percent pay raise earlier this year, but he displayed no willingness to compromise in response to complaints over pay that members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> hear when they go home to the voters. `` I have never seen so many judges at all levels, in all courts, and in all parts of the country so disheartened as I do today,'' <PERSON> Coffin </PERSON> said. `` Ours is a lunar landscape with all of the stark and ominous silhouettes that the term implies.'' He called Feb. 7, the day <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> defeated the pay raise, `` Black Tuesday.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Coble </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, replied, `` Many voters in my district do not regard it as Black Tuesday, and I'm one of them.'' Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>., said, `` One catalyst for that defeat was the front page story in most of the nation's newspapers that former Chief Justice <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>'' and other senior judges who do no judicial work would get the raise He said he went to four town meetings in his district at that time `` and I heard about that 50 times if I heard about it once.'' Then he offered the three judges what he called `` a little bit of friendly advice: the senior judge situation must be resolved if you want a pay raise. ... And I've not seen much in the way of constructive suggestions from you.'' Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sangmeister </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., said he too was peppered with objections at town meetings after the news stories `` I was faced with the Burger question,'' <PERSON> Sangmeister </PERSON> said. `` And I was not able to defend that.'' Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported previously unpublished federal figures from 1987 that showed that 20 percent of 306 senior federal judges did no judicial work. These include <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>, who since he stepped down has spent his time chairing the celebration of the bicentennials of the Constitution and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> of Rights. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey of all senior judges in February and March of this year found that 17 percent of 277 senior judges did no judicial work. The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> survey credited judges for dormant cases still on their dockets, which the earlier government data had not. Coffin and his colleagues told the subcommittee it would be unfair to deprive non-working senior judges of pay raises by, as Coffin put it, `` suddenly changing the rules after a lifetime.'' He said only three of the non-working seniors were under age 70; 16 were in their 70s, 20 in their 80s, two in their 90s and two in their 100s. <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON> asked whether these non-working senior judges should n't go into full retirement. <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON> and the subcommittee's ranking Republican, Rep. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moorhead </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, introduced a bill earlier this month to require that senior judges carry a 25 percent workload to qualify for raises. Those senior judges who did less work would get their last full salary and cost-of-living increases, but no raises above that. At the hearing, <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON> announced that he and <PERSON> Moorhead </PERSON> had agreed to the judges' request to introduce in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a 30 percent pay raise and annual cost-of-living increases for judges. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed a 25 percent pay raise for judges. A 51 percent raise tied to equal increases for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and top executive branch officials died earlier this year in the face of public uproar. Currently, judges who reach 65 with 15 years experience can resign and keep for life the full salary on their last day of work. They get no cost-of-living increases but are allowed to resume the private practice of law. Currently, 14 have done this. Alternatively, at that age and experience, federal judges may opt for senior status and do as much or as little work as they like. These senior judges still pick up all the pay raises given to active judges, and like active judges they ca n't have private law practices. The number of judges in this category hovers near 300. There are about 700 active judges.

<HEAD>Kremlin Will Publish Defense and Space Spending Data, Scientist Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Kremlin will publish long-promised figures on the Soviet defense and space budgets by the end of the year, says <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON>, a leading <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> rocket scientist who is prominent in the reform movement. Soviet military spending is being cut 1.5 percent this year, far short of the 14.2 percent cut announced by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in January, said <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON>, who is a member of the Supreme Soviet, or parliament. Defense spending will go down another 7 percent in 1990, and the cuts will reach 14.2 percent the following year, he said, although the total amount of the cuts remained unclear. `` We have promised that the absolute figure would be given in the fall,'' <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON> told a group of reporters Thursday. <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON> declined to specify how he knew that military spending figures would be disclosed by year end, but he is thought to be part of a group of scientists and intellectuals who advise <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on foreign policy. <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON> was also elected in balloting March 26 to represent the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in the newly created <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION>' Deputies, which will have the twin functions of electing a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> president _ almost certainly voting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a new five-year term _ and selecting a new smaller parliament. The issue of Soviet military spending is murky. For years, Western analysts have complained that figures for Soviet defense spending were distorted because prices are set by the state, and the cost of expensive armaments could be vastly underestimated in official statistics. An indefinite delay in implementing price deregulation has led Western analysts to say that even more complete disclosure of Soviet military spending can not be accurate, since Soviet leaders themselves do not know the true cost of weapons. A study released last weekend by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said that Soviet military spending had risen by 3 percent in 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> found strong evidence, however, that last year `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took several actions that evidently were intended to lay the groundwork for future military cuts.'' Furthermore, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> concluded, the 14.2 percent cut in military spending announced by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last January probably will lead to much larger cuts than the 500,000 troop reduction he announced at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> last December. <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON>'s description of the 14.2 percent defense cuts as gradual suggested that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wants to make them as part of arms control agreements with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON>, in a wide-ranging discussion, also released the text of a hitherto undisclosed resolution he said was passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> last week describing the deaths of 20 demonstrators in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> as a `` criminal act'' that endangered to Kremlin reforms. <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON> was one of three members of the Soviet academy, along with human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> historian <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Likhachev </PERSON>, appointed to a parliamentary investigating panel. `` The tragic events in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> -LRB- capital of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> -RRB- confirm the sad fact that perestroika is in danger,'' said the resolution, using the Russian name for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. Special uniformed troops under the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, or MVD, were responsible for using poisonous chemicals, shovels and clubs to suppress the demonstrations in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> on April 9, killing 20 people, the statement said. `` This unusually cruel act has evoked the deep indignation and outrage of our entire society,'' said the resolution, which <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON> said was passed at a meeting of the entire <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> April 21.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, designing systems in which three or four seconds `` is forever,'' has developed a graphics-oriented computer program to help flight controllers react to launch emergencies. Atlantis, with five astronauts aboard, was scheduled to launch at midafternoon today. In the seconds and minutes after liftoff, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is to make its most extensive use of a flight control system which highlights potential hazards with colorful displays. Past mission managers had to sort through mind-numbing columns of data on black-and-white monitors that date back to the Gemini era of the 1960s. The new system, inaugurated at <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> after the 1986 Challenger disaster, gives <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> controllers three or four more seconds to order a shuttle into an emergency landing in case of a sudden failure after liftoff. `` Three to four seconds in a lot of different failure modes is forever,'' says senior <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> controller <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Muratore </PERSON>. From typewriter-style keyboards, controllers can now punch up graphics that trace the shuttle trajectory, duplicate cockpit instrument displays and even mimic the horizon as the astronauts see it from inside their rising space ship. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is designing artificial intelligence programs to help plug its `` brain drain'' as thousands of experienced Apollo era employees retire. The generic name for such programs is `` expert systems.'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has begun implementing its expert system at the <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> center in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> as part of a multimillion-dollar improvement program scheduled for completion in 1991. <PERSON> Muratore </PERSON> is in charge of developing the system. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> hopes expert systems can capture the knowledge of veteran employees to help younger workers do various jobs. <PERSON> Muratore </PERSON> predicted his system will cut months off the minimum time of two years that controllers must spend in training before being assigned to a flight. `` They have to make a mental picture of what's going on with the shuttle,'' <PERSON> Muratore </PERSON> explained. `` We took some senior controllers and learned how they built their mental models, then programmed the computer to do that for them.'' When shuttles returned to flight in September, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> installed the expert system to help engineers pinpoint trouble in the orbiter's three main engines. It ran in tandem with the traditional system. `` We were prepared to take actions'' based on the new program, <PERSON> Muratore </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know of any other case where somebody has built an expert system and then put life and property on the line that way.'' Since then, <PERSON> Muratore </PERSON> said, the system has become a `` primary tool'' for four controllers who monitor communications, engines, mechanical systems, and guidance and navigation. With the system <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is phasing out, controllers decipher multiple pages of data displayed on their computer screens, all while monitoring dozens of blinking console lights _ each of which can signal two or more safe or unsafe conditions. In the old system, flight information is stored in two computers and displayed on every controller's console. By comparison, <PERSON> Muratore </PERSON>'s system divides the data among individual consoles, shaving precious seconds off the processing.

<HEAD>House Panel Wants S&amp;L Owners to Put up More Money</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members who want savings and loan owners to put up more of their own money when they make loans will be fighting to preserve a legislative victory when they resume work next week on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bailout proposal. After hours of debate, the panel voted 36-15 Thursday to require S & amp; L owners by January 1995 to risk $ 3 of `` tangible'' or `` real money'' capital for every $ 100 they lend. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> praised the action in a statement released after the vote, even though the deadline is 3 -LCB- years later than the June 1991 date sought by the administration. `` Requiring S & amp; Ls to put their own capital at risk ahead of the taxpayers' money is the only way to prevent in the future the unsound business practices that contributed to the current crisis,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is proposing to spend at least $ 157 billion over 10 years, the bulk of it from taxpayers, to close or merge failed S & amp; Ls. He also wants to restructure the regulatory system, spend $ 50 million a year to investigate and prosecute fraud in S & amp; Ls and boost capital requirements. Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> said the panel's adoption of a 3 percent layer of protection between S & amp; L loans that could go sour and federal insurance funds was more important than the timetable for achieving it However, consumer groups are worried about a subsequent amendment, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., that would permit thrift institutions to continue to risk depositors' funds in subsidiaries involved in high-risk investments such as junk bonds and commercial real estate `` It's a pretty critical loophole,'' said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a lobbyist for the Consumer Federation of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` It erodes what was just passed.'' The administration had proposed that institutions raise extra capital to back those subsidiaries and the committee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, had attempted to compromise by giving institutions five years to come up with the money. However, the committee voted 26-24 to adopt <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>'s measure. He argued that without it many institutions now operating safely and profitably with subsidiaries would not be able to raise the extra capital. Another amendment, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., would permit federal regulators to count mortgage servicing contracts as capital Such contracts, which pay institutions to collect monthly payments from homeowners on behalf of investors who own the mortgages, provide a steady source of income and can be sold if an institution is closed. The overall capital measure has a series of interim targets, beginning June 1, 1990, when the tangible capital standard would become 1.5 percent. It would move to 2 percent in January 1992, 2.25 percent in January 1993 and 2.625 percent in January 1994 before reaching the full 3 percent a year later. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee's standard is substantially stricter than the bill passed last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which would require 1.5 percent tangible capital by June 1991. Current law provides for a 3 percent standard, but contains many accounting loopholes that count intangible assets such as `` goodwill'' as capital. At the end of last year, more than a third of the solvent <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls' $ 60 billion in listed capital was composed of goodwill, which represents the value an institution's customer loyalty and name recognition Critics argue that goodwill evaporates when an institution fails and thus provides no protection to government deposit insurance funds. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, about two-thirds of the nation's 3,000 S & amp; Ls can meet the 3 percent tangible standard. Some of those that do not should be able to raise the money, but about 245 may have to seek merger partners, it said. Institutions failing to meet the standard would be subject to growth restrictions and closer regulatory supervision. Rep. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Flake </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said he intends to offer an amendment Monday that would provide more favorable treatment of goodwill. He and others, including the powerful chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., argue that it is unfair to wipe out the goodwill because during the early 1980s regulators permitted the accounting break to otherwise healthy institutions in exchange for taking over ailing thrifts

<HEAD>Anti-Baldness Drug Works on Growth Genes, Researchers Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers for a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> pharmaceutical company say the anti-baldness drug minoxidil appears to stimulate the genes that make hair grow. Minoxidil `` not only affects growing cells, but affects cells that make hair-shaft protein,'' <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Groppi </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a research with the <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, said Wednesday. `` Minoxidil affects gene activity that affects the growth of the -LRB- hair -RRB- shaft.'' Knowledge gained from study of minoxidil's effects on genes could have implications for research into genetically based diseases, such as sickle-cell anemia, said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Buhl </PERSON>, also an <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> researcher. Marketed by <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> under the trade-name Rogaine, minoxidil was originally developed for use internally to control blood pressure. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> last year approved the drug for use externally as a treatment for baldness. Although the drug is approved for sale, scientists have n't clearly understood why minoxidil promotes hair growth <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> researchers had theorized that the drug improved the flow of blood to the hair roots, thereby stimulating growth. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> research, released at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dermatology </ORGANIZATION>, suggested the drug had a more basic effect on hair growth. <PERSON> Groppi </PERSON> said he believes minoxidil's effect on the genes is particularly strong. `` I ca n't think of -LRB- a drug -RRB- offhand that has such a potent effect on gene expression,'' he said. Another scientist, however, was skeptical that the <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> finding represented a significant advance. `` It could well be that it does affect those genes, but there are very many stimulants on the cells that control genes,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, biology professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` That does not set minoxidil apart.'' Although the drug may affect hair follicles, there is no reason to believe that the drug would have similar effects on other types of cells, <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> said the research would have been more convincing had it identified a specific gene or group of genes affected by the drug. <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the researchers had n't identified a specific gene

 A hearing on why a cargo door tore off a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 747, killing nine passengers, ended without conclusive evidence on the cause of the February accident southwest of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> listened for three days to a list of missteps by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, and grilled aircraft designers from The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, but no culprit emerged. `` The hearings here were extremely helpful,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigation, said Thursday. `` We gained a lot of good information.'' He declined to make any conclusions, but said the information will be analyzed for several months before the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> issues a final report identifying the probable cause of the accident, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. The cargo door and part of the fuselage tore off <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 811 as the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 was climbing to 23,000 feet on Feb. 24. Nine passengers were sucked out of the plane over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, 85 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> as the plane headed for <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. Speculation has focused on a possible malfunction in the locking mechanism of the cargo door, which remains on the bottom of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> has not decided whether to retrieve the door. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> officials said they failed to fully inspect a cargo door after electrical repairs were made two months before the accident. A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> executive said mechanics made a partial inspection of the cargo door after it was repaired Dec. 23 in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. That was a coincidence, because the company has testified it was unaware it was under federal regulations to do a full inspection of the doors. `` I am convinced the check ... verified that the door was working,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Doll </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> vice president for technical services. He added, however, that the inspection was not as thorough as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> required. In other testimony, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspector who oversees <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s 31-plane 747 fleet said he was not aware of the problems with the 800-pound cargo door The inspector, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Batiza </PERSON>, also said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> had failed to ensure that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> complied with a federal rule that took effect July 1, requiring airlines to inspect cargo doors after they were manually operated because of electrical problems. <PERSON> Batiza </PERSON> testified that he had not found any deficiencies in <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s maintenance program recently, even though <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> officials have acknowledged they were unaware of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rule on cargo door inspections and were not in compliance for about nine months.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> sent an $ 8,000 check this week to pay the costs of chartering a campaign airplane four years ago from an associate of the owner of a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> savings and loan institution. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who on Thursday lost his bid to make an early presentation of his case before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, said the failure to pay the bill earlier was an `` oversight.'' In another matter Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee rescheduled the testimony of five Texans involved in a gas drilling venture that yielded huge profits to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. The five were threatened with a contempt citation if they fail to show up for a second time. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office this week filed a correction to his campaign financial report for 1985 to disclose the reimbursement. Aide <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said he did n't ask the owner of the plane, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON>, why he suddenly called this week for the money. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office was notified of the unpaid bill on Tuesday after Hood learned that the Wall Street Journal was inquiring about the matter, according to knowledgeable sources. According to a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> source who spoke on condition of anonymity, <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> was an associate of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON>, owner of a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> savings and loan institution, arranged the charter for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s campaign, the source said. The trip June 30 to July 2, 1985, included <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> and others. The tour of seven <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cities was in preparation for a November fund-raiser, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office said. The ethics committee has decided against pursuing charges that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> improperly lobbied federal S & amp; L regulators to go easy on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrifts, including <PERSON> Gaubert </PERSON>'s. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s involvement in S & amp; L issues has figured in the panel's determination of whether he improperly took gifts from people with a direct interest in legislation governing the industry. On <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s request to make a personal appeal to the ethics panel, its chairman hinted strongly for the first time Thursday there will be no such opportunity until <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> appears at a disciplinary hearing expected to come late next month. `` No, there has not been an agreement reached'' on a speedy hearing, said the chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` I assume he would appear at the disciplinary hearing. At a two-hour meeting Thursday behind closed doors, the panel heard an account from <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> of their trip early this week to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, when they were `` stood up'' by the participants in the gas well venture. The panel then ratified <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s ruling that a subpoena for the witnesses was valid and enforceable, the chairman said. The testimony is scheduled for next week. `` Without any question, the committee lost round one, but there'll be more of this fight before it's over,'' said <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, the panel's senior Republican. The committee is seeking to wrap up loose ends in its 10-month investigation of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who has been formally charged with 69 instances of violating House rules. The charges allege that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, improperly accepted some $ 145,000 in gifts from a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> business partner who had a direct interest in congressional legislation and that he used bulk sales of a book he wrote to circumvent <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits on outside earned income. But before finishing its preliminary inquiry into charges against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the panel wants to know whether a gas well that produced a financial bonanza to the speaker's blind trust amounted to a gift from people with an interest in legislation. Part of the inquiry also will focus on whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s blind trust, which the ethics committee approved when the trust was established in 1987, was truly insulated from <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Mallightco, an investment partnership of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> real estate developer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, and their wives, turned a $ 9,120 cash investment into a $ 340,000 profit in one day last May, boosting the value of the partnership just a month before <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s blind trust sold its interest. The amount of money involved aroused the curiosity of the ethics panel, and subpoenas were issued for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, his son M.D. -LRB- <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, and three others involved in the transaction. The five failed to show up Tuesday for a scheduled interview at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> hotel. <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brand </ORGANIZATION>, their <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer, argued in a letter that the subpoenas were too broad, violated his clients' right to privacy and were irrelevant to the ethics panel's inquiry The committee overruled Brand and ordered the witnesses to come to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for interviews on May 3 and 4, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>House Panel Sends $1.17 Trillion Budget to Floor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leading lawmakers predict that a $ 1.17 trillion budget for 1990, thrashed out in days of often contentious closed-door meetings by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, will be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> next week. The panel approved the spending plan on a bipartisan 18-6 vote on Thursday, edging the budget deal completed two weeks ago between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional leaders closer to enactment. The proposal claims a deficit of $ 99.4 billion, just within the $ 100 billion ceiling required by the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. It would hold defense spending below the rate of inflation and give big boosts to education, science and health programs, while cutting agriculture, environment and energy spending. As they finished their work on the document, committee members echoed remarks made frequently in recent days about the direction this year's budget seems to be headed. `` I assume it will pass because there is no alternative,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Olav </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabo </PERSON>, D-Minn., who voted against the proposal in committee Rep. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, R-Ky., who also opposed the plan, said he believed that the deficit reduction it claimed was largely phony, but that the proposal would be approved anyway `` With the head of steam it's got from the budget summit and from the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leadership, it will be hard to overcome,'' he said. House Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., who is on the committee, also predicted the measure would clear the chamber, saying he expected little trouble from conservatives over the defense expenditures it permits `` Do you think people will look at the defense money in this bill, with its being blessed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, and say it's not enough?'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has said he believes the cuts in the defense budget will be difficult but are manageable. Because the budget pact between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional leaders set overall spending limits for defense, domestic programs and foreign aid, those figures are identical in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions of the budget. The main differences between the two chambers is in how they distribute domestic funds. Energy programs would get $ 3.8 billion in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan and $ 4.2 billion in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Health spending would reach $ 56.2 billion under the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> proposal and $ 55.7 billion under the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Education would get $ 39.1 billion under the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget and $ 38.7 billion under the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget writers set aside enough money to pay for a Democratic initiative on children, with $ 1.8 billion for child care and more money for Head Start; an increase to $ 1.9 billion for AIDS research and treatment; full-inflation increases in programs for the poor; and a 3.6 percent cost-of-living raise for military and civilian federal workers. Before holding a brief public meeting at which they approved the spending plan, the budget committee met behind closed doors this week, arguing over spending priorities and working out a bipartisan deal. According to meeting participants who asked to not be identified, those sessions resulted in money being transferred to space and science programs, and to veterans programs, from other domestic initiatives. There were also attempts by liberals to slash the defense budget and distribute the money to domestic programs, such as Medicare, AIDS research, low-income programs, veterans health, and anti-drug efforts. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> passed its version of the budget on April 19. That chamber also expects to complete work next week on its spending blueprint.

 A Roman Catholic priest who is defying orders from his Jesuit superior in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to leave a group that provides aid to rural Nicaraguans has appealed his case to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, co-director of the Quixote Center in Mt. <PERSON> Rainier </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, held a news conference Thursday to declare his defiance. <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, a Jesuit for 40 of his 57 years, is also under orders to dissociate himself from a progressive <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> group and one that supports the ordination of women as priests. <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>'s order, for its part, refused to make the controversy any more public than it already was. `` Dealings ... between a religious and his superior are very much a confidential matter, and superiors find themselves in the position of having to protect that confidentiality,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>, press officer of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> province of the Society of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, said by telephone from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesuit </PERSON> provincial in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, has twice ordered <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, on pain of dismissal from the society, to leave the center and join a Jesuit community in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> within 15 days. <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> appealed the order to the Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolvenbach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesuit </PERSON> general in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, saying, `` To leave at this time would be a serious betrayal of my responsibility toward the people of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Mannings </ORGANIZATION>'s orders would make it impossible for him to carry on the work of <ORGANIZATION> Quest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>, an organization which he coordinates from the Quixote Center's headquarters. In his letter to <PERSON> Kolvenbach </PERSON>, he said Quest for Peace was formed `` to match <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the counter-revolutionaries attacking <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> with an equivalent value in donated humanitarian aid for the people of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' He said he had coordinated campaigns which raised $ 227 million over a three-year period in donated aid and contributed services. Earlier, <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> had told <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> that in order to remain a member of the society he must dissociate himself from `` Catholics Speak Out,'' an organization of Progressive Catholics, and `` Priests for Equality,'' which favors the ordination of women as priests. In a letter on April 3, after <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> said he was willing to work toward `` an acceptable compromise to alleviate the situation,'' <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> told <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, `` In fact, this is not a question of ` compromise.' It is, to repeat, a matter of obedience.'' <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> said the second deadline for him to report in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> was April 2. He said he had heard nothing further about his dismissal. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> also wrote to <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> that he must `` make no public statements critical of the church or its leadership without my prior knowledge and consent'' and not `` add any projects to the mission I have given you without my prior consent.''

 A mudslide caused by 30 hours of torrential rain killed nine gold miners and left seven others seriously injured in northwestern <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, police said. The mining accident occurred late Tuesday in the jungle municipality of <LOCATION> Mucajai </LOCATION>, 4,000 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, federal police Capt. <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Boa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION>, capital of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> state of <LOCATION> Roriama </LOCATION>. No one had heard that the 50-foot `` Deep Hole'' mine had caved in until one of the miners made his way 279 miles through the jungle and arrived in <LOCATION> Boa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION> late Thursday, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> said. `` A group of miners were apparently inside the hole when a wall of mud fell in on them and swallowed them alive,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> said. `` Seven of the men managed to make it out alive but they were badly hurt.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> said rescue teams made up of state and civil police were sent to the site but poor weather and the rugged terrain had delayed their arrival. An estimated 1 million prospectors have invaded <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s vast <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> rain forests after rich deposits of alluvial gold were discovered in 1979. Since then, thousands of people, mostly unskilled, have been lured to mine sites in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> where they dig with their hands and carry bags of mud on their backs in search of gold. In 1986, a similar mudslide killed 12 prospectors and hurt 20 others at `` The Hole'' gold mine in the northern state of <LOCATION> Para </LOCATION>. Government officials said last year that miners recovered about 70 tons of gold from the wilderness, worth an estimated $ 1 billion.

<HEAD>House Democrats Seeking Outside Counsel To Investigate Gingrich</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, which agreed to Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s demand a year ago for an outside counsel to investigate Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, now is being asked to hire another independent lawyer to investigate <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>. Four House Democrats drafted a letter Thursday to Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>, chairman of the ethics panel, calling for the appointment of an outside counsel to investigate the complaint Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., filed against the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> whip earlier this month Reps. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> sent copies of the letter to their <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> colleagues seeking support for their request to <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>. `` There is mounting evidence that Congressman <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> may have violated an assortment of House rules and federal campaign finance laws over an extended period of time through financial and other dealings,'' the four Democrats said in the letter to their colleagues. The letter to <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said the Democrats want `` to preserve the integrity of the committee's consideration process from politicization and outside pressure, and in that regard we believe the appointment of an impartial outside counsel is imperative.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s complaint, which was filed as the committee was nearing the end of its investigation of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, lists 10 apparent violations of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules in the formation and operation of a limited partnership set up in 1984 to promote a book co-written by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>. The committee has not indicated whether it will launch a formal investigation of the compliant. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, released nearly 400 pages of documents on Tuesday detailing the financial and incorporation history of the partnership. They denied any violation of House rules. Eighteen people and three corporations, including many regular contributors to <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s political campaigns, each invested $ 5,000 in the partnership, which was controlled by Mrs. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, the general partner. In return for promoting the book, the partnership was to have received half the publisher's profits, but the publisher lost money and the investors ended up with a tax writeoff. Mrs. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> was paid $ 11,500 by the partnership and received a 2 percent ownership interest in the organization. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> had no direct financial stake in the partnership, although he did receive $ 1,320 in expense reimbursements when he traveled to promote the book. He and his wife also received $ 12,018 each in royalties from the publisher from sales of the book. While Democrats were drumming up support for their bid for an outside counsel, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> was at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> outlining the message of Democratic corruption and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> opportunity he used propel himself in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leadership last month. The <LOCATION> Jonesboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, Republican said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> must build a `` caring, humanitarian, reform'' party that can offer institutional solutions to the problems of drugs, crime and poverty that are plaguing the nation's major cities. `` Every conservative in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must confront the reality that the great age of opposition conservatism is over,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> won the argument, and now the country wants us to govern. We must come up with a wave of reforms of extraordinary scale.''

<HEAD>More than One Woman in Five Gets Poverty Benefits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women are more likely to need anti-poverty assistance than men, as they struggle to raise children on their own and cope with leaner times in old age, a <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> report shows. More than one woman in five _ 20.5 percent _ received help from some major benefits program during a 32-month study reported on by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. During the same period the public assistance programs aided 15.8 percent of men in the nation, somewhat less than one out of six. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> said that the difference in need is largely the result of women raising children without a husband present and the preponderance of women in the older age groups. When marriages break up women more often obtain custody of the children, and those families more often lapse into poverty, <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. In addition, a growing number of single women are raising families of their own, he noted. As of 1987, the bureau said, 34.3 percent of families with a female householder fell below the poverty level. By comparison, 12.5 percent of families with a male householder and no wife, and only 6.0 percent of married couples fell below the poverty level. The analysis showed that more than two-thirds of people living in a female-headed household with no husband present throughout the study period received anti-poverty benefits _ 67.1 percent. The study found that 18.3 percent of all Americans received benefits from at least one of six programs studied. Included were general assistance, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, <ORGANIZATION> Supplemental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Income </ORGANIZATION>, Medicaid, federal food stamps and federal and state rent assistance. Benefits were more likely to go to minorities, to the very young and to people who had not finished high school, according to the report which covered the period from late 1983 to early 1986. `` One of the more important findings was that the likelihood of receiving benefits was very closely tied to the number of months in which income fell below the poverty level,'' <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> said. `` So, in that sense, the programs appear to be providing benefits to those who need them the most.'' This was the first long-term look at recipients of benefits done by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, and thus no past rates were available for comparison, <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> said. The study will be repeated in the future, he said. Nearly half of black Americans obtained help from one or more programs during the period, at 48.5 percent, the study said. By comparison, the rate was 34.2 percent for Hispanics and 13.9 percent for white Americans. Blacks also were longer-term recipients of help, averaging 11.2 months of benefits during the study period. Hispanics averaged 7.4 months of benefits while it was 2.6 months for white recipients. Overall, women recipients averaged 4.4 months of benefits, compared with 3.0 months for men. By age, people under age 18 were the leading group receiving benefits at 26.6 percent _ and the subgroup under age 6 managed a 30.1 percent rate. Programs benefited 19.9 percent of people aged 18 to 24, while in the 25 to 44 group the rate was 14.7 percent. For people aged 65 and over the rate was 17.9. Benefits were most needed by inner-city residents, at 23.7 percent. The rate was 20.5 percent in rural areas and fell to only 12.3 percent in the suburbs. By region, 20.7 percent of southerners received benefits, followed by 18.0 percent in the West, 16.8 percent in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and 16.7 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. The study was based on repeated interviews with 19,900 households across the country.

<HEAD>Detroit Teamsters Official with two Convictions Named International
VP</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Detroit-area Teamsters official with two convictions for union-related offenses has been named an international vice president of the nation's largest union, raising questions about its pledge to improve its image. The selection of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitale </PERSON> by <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, though not announced by the union, was confirmed Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> sources. A Teamsters spokesman did not return telephone calls seeking comment. The selection comes in the wake of the settlement of a racketeering suit against the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> and a pledge by its leaders to back election reforms and refurbish the union's image. `` <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> surely could have done better than to go out and appoint a guy who has been convicted of taking payoffs both from employers and stealing the union members' money,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Paff </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a dissident union group based in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vitale </PERSON>, president of Teamsters Local 283 in <LOCATION> Wyandotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, was convicted twice in the early 1970s, for accepting an illegal payment from a <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> employer and for illegal use of union funds in a plan to buy his wife a car. He received fines and probation for both convictions but was allowed to keep his union job. The prosecutor who handled the racketeering case raised the possibility that a court-appointed administrator agreed to as part of the settlement could review the <PERSON> Vitale </PERSON> appointment. `` The court-appointed administrator will have the authority to review the appointment and to discipline any Teamster officials,'' said assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastro </PERSON>. `` There is no statute of limitations on the right to discipline.'' The appointment of an administrator is expected to be made in the next two weeks. That is one of three court-appointed monitoring positions agreed to as part of the settlement of the racketeering suit, which alleged widespread organized crime influence on the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>. Critics within the union characterized the <PERSON> Vitale </PERSON> appointment as a slap at former Teamsters Vice President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> resigned in January in return for being dropped as a defendant in the suit. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> opposed <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s election to succeed the late <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> president. <PERSON> Vitale </PERSON> reportedly had a falling out with <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> in recent years. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> under Teamsters bylaws can fill vacancies on the union's <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> _ which consists of the president, secretary-treasurer and 16 international vice presidents _ subject to board approval. He has a solid majority on the board because of recent turnover and has two vacancies still to fill.

 Two college seniors had no trouble finding volunteers for research on their thesis, but some subjects were surprised to learn they could n't discern between cheap and expensive domestic beers. `` We figured that college students are experts on beer drinking and they would determine the difference in the five brands of domestic beer we tested,'' said <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON> <PERSON> Economon </PERSON>, who shared the project with his brother, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>. `` But, statistically, people could n't tell the difference,'' he said. `` Free beer'' fliers were posted around the University of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> campus and drew a predictable crowd, and 265 students ended up volunteering for the project. The sample was pared down to 191 students who said they drank five or more beers each week, and each participant was given 3-ounce sample cups of five different brands of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beer to measure for body, aftertaste, sweetness, bitterness and strength. `` Some people would say, ` This is great, I can buy cheap beer and get just as good a product,''' he said.

He would not reveal the brand names of beers tested, but said they ranged in price from $ 1.60 to $ 3.20 a six-pack.

 After only 100 days, it's hard to tell if President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s foreign policy is intentionally uninspiring or if he is simply taking his time coming to conclusions about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s role in the world He has pulled back from the polemics of his predecessor, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and in a few as yet inconclusive ways, such as a toughening stand toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, indicated that he just might adopt a foreign policy that is substantively different from the one he inherited. On the other hand, these changes are so slight it could turn out that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has no bold initiatives in mind, and that like President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> in the mid-1970s he intends mostly to mark time in the foreign field. An overseas crisis could intervene, forcing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to improvise a response that could lead to a dramatic shift in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. The rise to power in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1985 of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, for instance, impelled <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to drop his denunciations of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as an evil empire. The result was a series of negotiations that produced a lessening of tensions and the banning of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles. So far, international events have not conspired to draw <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into major decisions. A political scandal in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and growing West German distaste for nuclear weapons could produce severe strains, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has given no sign of a shift in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> determination to modernize <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has worked out a temporary deal with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to supply the Nicaraguan rebels with $ 49.8 million in non-military aid and he has endorsed an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> proposal for elections among Palestinian Arabs to implement self-rule on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Both are stopgap measures. They beg the question whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will pursue the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> policy of trying to topple the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> or is willing to live with it, and whether he will try to force <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> into a lasting agreement. The Contra aid package, the product of a March 24 agreement between the administration and the Democratic-led <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, is good only until the Fall. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> could make enough political concessions by then to get Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> off its back _ and spare <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a difficult decision. Less likely is that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election plan will induce the Palestinians and their supporters to adopt a gradual and peaceful approach to settling the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> problem <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has already declared himself opposed to Israeli `` occupation'' of sovereignty over the territories. This could be a sign that he intends to pressure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to yield control. But there is no hint of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan, of shuttle diplomacy by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, or that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will summon <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders to Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON>, as President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> did in 1978 to help squeeze out the peace treaty between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> a year later. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> evidently are committed to the proposition that direct negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> offer the best hope for an agreement that would hold up. High-profile <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomacy is not part of the picture at this point. In the important sphere of U.S.-Soviet relations, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s troop and missile reduction initiatives are receiving a skeptical response But <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact opened negotiations in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in March to trim tank and artillery units, and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> probably will set a date for the resumption of U.S.-Soviet talks on long-range nuclear weapons when he goes to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> May 11. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has the implicit support of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration as he consolidates his powers. This week, for instance, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> described his purge of 74 <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voting members and the promotion of several proteges as dramatic. It expressed hope that `` whatever changes occur, their effect is to strengthen and promote the reform process in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> toward greater democratization and openness.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, is encouraging reform in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> with a series of moves that could ease the Soviet ally's $ 39 billion foreign debt. ` ` Liberty is an idea whose time has come in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said in a speech last week He probably will visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> this summer to maintain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for change.

 Many babies born to mothers who use drugs are becoming `` boarders'' who strain staffs and facilities in urban hospitals after being abandoned by their parents, a hospital director told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` The problem that my hospital and hospitals in cities around the country are facing daily is caring for those newborn babies abandoned by drug abusing mothers,'' said <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Rice on Thursday told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> and Families that the overcrowding caused by these `` boarder babies'' has become so acute one day he was unable to locate an empty bed anywhere between <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> for an acutely ill infant. Boarder babies are children who remain in hospitals after birth even though they are medically ready for discharge, he said. The problem is being exacerbated in the nation's capital by the rising cross-generational family use of crack cocaine, said <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. `` Now we are seeing 28 - and 35-year-old grandmothers who are themselves substance abusers and who can not readily step in to provide the social support as in the past. An internal study found the average stay for 27 of the 45 babies being boarded at Howard between August and December 1988 was 42.3 days. The average expected hospital stay for a newborn is three days. `` The longest-stay infant had been in the hospital for 245 days at a cost in excess of $ 250,000,'' said <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, noting the Medicaid payment received by the hospital was set at $ 6,100 regardless of the length of stay or extent of services the child received while there. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> recommended streamlining foster care and adoption procedures to speed the placement of boarder babies into stable homes. This is not a new phenomenon, he said, explaining that 20 years ago `` when I worked in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the public hospitals there had about 200 babies on a daily basis who had been abandoned at the hospitals by heroin addicted mothers.'' <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavkin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> doctor, said a recent report by the city comptroller shows the problem has not abated, indicating maternal drug use was the reason for the boarder status of 49 percent of the more than 300 children under age 2 in city hospitals. <PERSON> Chavkin </PERSON> said the lack of drug treatment facilities for women in general and pregnant women specifically also contributes to the problem.

 He is the mystery man of the nation's worst oil spill, the third mate who was on watch when the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> ran aground and dumped more than 10 million gallons of crude in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> Little has been seen of Gregory Cousins since the March 24 accident, and federal officials do n't expect him to surface until the May 16-19 hearings in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> to assess what happened and how to prevent a recurrence. Capt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, who the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> says was the only person aboard authorized to navigate the tanker through the sound, blamed his third mate when the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> radioed his ship an hour after the wreck. `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> here,'' the skipper answered when <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> asked for a damage report. `` A little problem here with the third mate, but we're working our way off the reef,'' said <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, who tried to rock the ship free before shutting down the engines and waiting for help. Cousins had signed on with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> as a third mate, although he had obtained his second mate's certification Jan. 12. `` That's not unusual,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaminski </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` With fewer positions available, people set sail at positions lower than their license.'' A second mate is the navigator and is in charge of maps and charts. The third mate is in charge of maintenance and the inventory of firefighting equipment. They and the chief mate, who's in charge of the cargo, alternate four-hour watches on the bridge <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> turned the 987-foot tanker and its 42 million gallons of oil destined for <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, over to Cousins sometime after a state pilot with federal pilot authority left the ship at Rocky Point. <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> was seven miles away. `` At that time the master -LRB- <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> -RRB- was in the wheelhouse,'' said Coast Guard Cmdr. <PERSON> Darryle </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldron </PERSON>. `` The master had federal pilotage -LRB- authority -RRB- for Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> through the entrance. The mates did n't have the necessary endorsements on their licenses.'' The pilots used to navigate ships out of the sound to the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> until the 1980s when a smaller ship taking a pilot back to <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> capsized in rough seas. The pilot nearly died, and the rules were eased. Cousins, reportedly a resident of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, was licensed out of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and obtained his third mate's license March 19, 1986. Coast Guard records in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, showed he had no record of disciplinary action. Cousins is still employed by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, but the oil company refused to say where he is working or living. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was dismissed after he tested at .06 on a blood-alcohol test nine hours after the wreck. The legal limit on blood-alcohol tests for ship captains is .04. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said he doubted <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> would attend the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s hearing in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. `` If a witness is simply going to sit on the stand and take the Fifth -LRB- Amendment right against self-incrimination -RRB- all day ... We'd rather have people give us information That looks like the case with <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> faces three misdemeanor charges stemming from the accident, including operating a vessel while under the influence. Cousins was a more likely participant in the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> hearing, said <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>. Other <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> officials confirmed the agency has talked with Cousins and hopes to have a longer interview before the May hearing.

<HEAD>Laser Erases Tattoos Without Scars or Pain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new laser technique erases tattoos but spares the skin, providing the first way to get rid of battleships, hearts, old lovers' names or other such decorations without causing scars, researchers say. The treatment uses an intense beam of light called a ruby laser to blast away the colors beneath the skin. `` I think this is the first truly non-scarring therapy for tattoos,'' said Dr. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rox </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a member of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s research team, planned to present the results of the laser treatment today at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dermatology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Doctors said the laser is almost painless, too. It produces a sensation something like a loosely snapped rubber band. Lasers are already widely used for removing tattoos, but current models burn them off, leaving permanent scars. The new technique also produces high heat, but its effects are much more selective. It uses brief, 100 million-watt flashes of red light, which is absorbed by the tattoo pigment. The heat shatters the bits of pigment imbedded in the skin as well as the cells that hold them. But it does not harm blood vessels or ordinary cells. `` There is clearly a difference between this and other therapies that are used,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the procedure could become the standard treatment for removing tattoos after it is approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, perhaps within two years. Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Arndt </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> agreed. `` When the ruby laser works well, which looks to be a good deal of the time, the skin remains normal,'' he said. `` That's extraordinary, and it's bringing fancy technology to the level where it can be useful for patient care. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said that in testing so far on 13 people, the laser completely erased about half of the tattoos and faded the rest. However, he said the initial study was intended to find the proper intensity of laser light, and some patients received relatively low doses. Results may be better when higher levels are used routinely. Of 41 tatoos treated, only one small patch of skin measuring less than a square inch became scarred. The laser will not remove red pigment because it does not absorb the red light. Amateur tattoos come off more easily than professionally drawn tattoos, which contain more color. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said that after his team began experimenting with the ruby laser, they discovered that a group of doctors in <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, had worked on the same approach and published preliminary results in a British journal. Unless burned or removed surgically, tattoos are permanent. The <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> researchers said that most of the people they have treated so far got them while drunk. One woman had her boyfriend's initials tattooed when she was a teen-ager. The next day she regretted it, and always kept the tattoo covered with a bandage. Tattoos are drawn by puncturing the skin, usually with needles, and inserting pigment that remains after the wound heals over. The variety of laser used in the new treatment was once widely tested for medical purposes, but none of them seemed to work and it was abandoned. The ruby laser is used largely for welding.

<HEAD>Iowa Governor Signs Riverboat Gambling Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> has taken the final step to launch floating casinos on <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s rivers and lakes. He declared `` the integrity of the state will be protected'' as more than 50 backers watched him Thursday sign the bill legalizing gambling on casino boats. `` I could n't be happier,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Fey </PERSON>, an author of the gambling bill that culminated a four-year drive. `` It took a long, hard effort.'' `` This bill will provide an economic shot in the arm for many river communities that wish to further promote tourism,'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said. `` Our major rivers are already prime tourist destination points and this bill would attract even more tourists to these locations.'' Jubilant backers predicted historic 19th century riverboats would be luring thousands of tourists and millions of dollars to a state that's suffered from years of farm-based economic hard times. `` In two years we'll see a major economic benefit to eastern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnould </PERSON>, a Davenport Democrat. For his part, <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> focused on economic development, tourism and controls which limit each bet to $ 5 and nightly losses to $ 200. The governor rejected suggestions floating casinos are out of place in the conservative middle of the nation's heartland. `` I'm very sensitive to that,'' said <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>. `` I'm very proud of the pristine reputation our state has.'' Under the new law, riverboats could begin operating in 1991 and would be regulated by the state's <ORGANIZATION> Racing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which would issue gambling licenses. Before any license could be issued, voters in the county where it would dock would have to approve. Criticism came from a coalition of conservative Republicans who fought it on moral grounds and liberal church groups who feared exploitation of the poor. The riverboat gambling measure is the latest form of legalized gambling to win approval in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, which already has a state-run lottery and parimutuel betting at horse and dog tracks.

 <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jemima </PERSON>'s down-home style is giving way to a more sophisticated look. Gone are the geometric-print headband and plain white collar. The `` new'' <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jemima </PERSON> wears gold-trimmed pearl earrings, a lace collar and soft, wavy, gray-streaked hair. <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, home to this ageless black woman since 1926, is updating the 100-year-old trademark. But she still looks like she knows her way around the kitchen, company spokesman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bottrell </PERSON> said Thursday. And her smiling face _ adorning 40 breakfast products from pancakes to syrup to grits _ is the same. It did n't change much in 1968, either, when <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> gave the once-portly icon a more svelte look. So why bother? It was time, says Quaker. The time comes about every 20 years. Five months of consumer research in 12 cities `` showed very high awareness of the Aunt <PERSON> Jemima </PERSON> trademark and positive perceptions among all groups,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, vice president for marketing in <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION>'s convenience foods division. The new design, which will begin appearing in July, `` gives our Aunt <PERSON> Jemima </PERSON> line a more contemporary look as we move into the 1990s,'' she said. Consumers surveyed were offered two or three choices for a revamped <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jemima </PERSON>, none of them dramatically different because <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> wanted to keep the `` good will and positive perceptions that already existed,'' <PERSON> Bottrell </PERSON> said. The consumers had firm notions about her. Some described <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jemima </PERSON> as `` a young grandmother,'' he said. `` She works, she has a family,'' others suggested. But the consensus across the board was that `` she definitely knows how to cook,'' <PERSON> Bottrell </PERSON> said. `` In order for this to have any credibility, people need to expect that of <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jemima </PERSON>,'' he said. `` We wanted a more modern-looking woman, but one who still has traditional values. The original Aunt <PERSON> Jemima </PERSON> <PERSON> Pancake </PERSON> <PERSON> Mix </PERSON> was introduced in 1889, a breakthrough convenience product from the <ORGANIZATION> R.T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, where it is still made by Quaker. Today, <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jemima </PERSON> is the leading brand in both pancake mixes and syrups, offering low-calorie variations and microwave convenience, the company said. Her products represent about $ 300 million of <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 5.3 billion in sales.

 Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is rejecting a proposal to reduce <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> `` catastrophic'' health insurance premiums that congressional analysts expect to generate a bigger surplus than is needed. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, in a letter to Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION> that was released Thursday, said the insurance program `` is literally in its first few months of life'' and the administration wants to be sure it is not left with insufficient reserves.

<TEXT>
 A West German described by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities as `` the world's top techno-bandit'' was sentenced to an additional 2 -LCB- years in prison and fined $ 40,000 for a daring helicopter prison escape attempt. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON>, 49, to 30-month concurrent sentences Thursday on each of two counts of conspiracy to escape. The term will be tacked onto a 15-year term <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON> received in 1987 for sales of classified technology to Soviet bloc countries. <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> criticized letters he got on behalf of <LOCATION> Bruchhausen </LOCATION> which were critical of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> judicial system, saying, `` I thought I ought to let you know this system has provided you with a fair trial.'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> urged the judge to exceed sentencing guidelines, which called for a maximum prison term of 30 months. He discounted the defense contention that <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON> was entrapped. `` He was the person who initiated the plan,'' said <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>. Defense attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Culpepper </PERSON>, who asked the judge to stay within the guidelines, said no decision had been made on an appeal. Authorities foiled <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON>'s escape by setting up a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs helicopter as the escape aircraft. He had reportedly offered to pay up to $ 250,000 for assistance. <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON> was taken into custody by an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent and four prison officers as he started toward the aircraft that had swooped down over the softball field in the prison recreation yard last August. He was later transferred to the federal penitentiary in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The West German citizen began serving his sentence at the <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> prison in May 1987. <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON> and three others were indicted in August 1981 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on charges of conspiracy and violating the Export Administration Act, the Arms Export and Control Act and federal income tax laws. The 60-count indictment charged that from January 1977 through June 5, 1980, <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON> and the others `` conspired to export from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> various high technology commodities'' to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and elsewhere without export licenses from the State and Commerce departments. At that time, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabb </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON> `` one of the world's top techno-bandits.'' He was arrested on May 8, 1985, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, extradited the following year and convicted of wire fraud in 1987. <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON> allegedly smuggled a microwave receiver system, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, a computer system and other military and scientific items to the Soviet bloc through dummy corporations in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

Currency dealers said the dollar's surge came as concern briefly subsided about an immediate increase in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s official discount rate following the release of April's Tokyo-area consumer price report. Consumer prices for April in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> rose 2.6 percent from a year earlier and 1.4 percent from the prior month, according to a government report released Friday. `` The figures were largely within that of an anticipated range ... but many investors were still taking a cautious position on a possible interest rate hike,'' said a dealer with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke anonymously. Finance Minister <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murayama </PERSON> told a news conference Friday that the nation's central bank is worried about price stability and high oil prices. But the tone of his remarks also suggested there will not be an immediate change in monetary policy based on the price data. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> said Thursday the central bank would act swiftly, if necessary, to sustain price stability. The major national newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> is likely to hike its official interest rate, now standing at a historic low of 2.5 percent, to 3.0 percent as early as mid-May to alleviate inflationary pressure. On the stock exchange, the market's main barometer started on a strong note following a 29.88-point rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight, dealers said. They said the stock market also welcomed the fact that April's Tokyo-area consumer index was well below an originally expected increase of 3-3 .5 percent, helping to temporarily ease the inflationary

 If you're trying to stay away from a heart attack, federal health researchers say your chances are best out <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s rate of death from heart disease is barely half the rate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which reports three such deaths per 1,000 residents per year, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. After <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, rounding out the healthiest-heart list are <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s findings, from a study of heart disease deaths in 1986, the latest year available, mark a continuation of previously reported trends in coronary mortality. Also continuing is a trend with heart disease deaths going down, while hospitalizations for heart disease are rising, the Atlanta-based agency said in its weekly report. The nation in 1986 recorded 593,111 deaths from coronary heart disease, chiefly heart attacks and other blocked-artery heart problems, accounting for 28 percent of all deaths in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. By comparison, cancer, the nation's No. 2 killer, took 466,000 lives in 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> study found the highest rate of heart disease deaths in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, which recorded 58,473 such deaths, or 303 per 100,000 residents. The other states in the top five were all in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> or the northern <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>: <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, with a rate of 299 heart disease deaths per 100,000; <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 284; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, 278; and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, 274. The national rate was 246 heart disease deaths per 100,000 Americans. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> had the lowest rate of heart disease deaths, with 1,403, or 166 per 100,000. Next up the list were four other western states: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, 184; <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, 189; <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, 190; and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, 190. <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> researchers say people in more populous areas are more likely to have inactive lifestyles _ holding desk jobs, riding instead of walking _ which can contribute to the risk of heart attack or heart disease. `` We really do n't know what the reason is,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> researcher. `` We suspect some of the risk factors for heart disease may be found more commonly in those regions.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> also reported Thursday that while deaths from heart disease have declined 20 percent since 1968, the rate of hospitalization from heart disease has risen. Among men, the hospitalization rate for heart disease was 1,066 per 100,000 nationwide in 1986, up from 784 in 1970. Among women, the rate was 718 in 1986, up from 570 in 1970. Men are consistently hospitalized for heart disease at a rate 50 percent higher than women. The decrease in deaths from heart disease probably represents `` diminishing incidence,'' but with medical advances, more heart disease patients than ever before seem to be getting hospital treatment, said the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothenberg </PERSON>. `` It's an interesting social trend,'' he said. `` It has a lot to do with -LRB- trends in -RRB- disease, mixed with hospital policies. ... We really need more research trying to pinpoint what is actually going on.'' The increase in recorded heart-disease hospitalizations could be because of a number of factors, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said, including improved survival of heart patients, progress in medical technology and even changes in hospital procedures and classification systems.

<HEAD>FDA Advisers Urge Green Light For Contraceptive Implant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An expert advisory panel recommends federal approval of birth control implants that work up to five years, but a final decision by Food and Drug Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> may take months. Among the issues the agency still must review are the effectiveness of the implants in heavier women and how long the contraceptive protection lasts, <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> said the 11-member Fertility and <ORGANIZATION> Maternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drugs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> unanimously approved the implant, called Norplant, because it is at least as safe and effective as any other contraceptive on the market The six slow-release silicone capsules, each about the size of a match stick, are implanted under a local anesthetic in a woman's upper arm They must be replaced after five years. Norplant, already being used in several foreign countries, contains a hormone called levonorgestrel that is also used in many birth control pills. But unlike the pills, it does not contain estrogen, the hormone often implicated as a possible cause of heart attacks and strokes. The Population Council, a non-profit international family planning organization, sought <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval of Norplant so it could be distributed overseas by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. The implant is made by <ORGANIZATION> Wyeth-Ayerst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The Population Council says that in tests, the implants have been 99.8 percent effective over five years in women weighing less than 110 pounds, and 91.4 percent effective in women weighing more than 153 pounds.

<HEAD>Aloha Airlines Accident Changed Industry Philosophy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINE DONNELLY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the year since the roof ripped off an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet and a flight attendant plunged to her death, widespread changes have occurred in the industry that once believed a maintained aircraft could fly forever. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 involved had rolled off the assembly line in 1969 and had 89,000 cycles _ takeoffs and landings _ in a corrosive salt-air environment. The industry and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had believed that metal fatigue in older airplanes, especially cracking around rivets and corrosion, could be discovered in regular visual inspections. However, in the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> case, investigators think dozens of minute cracks _ invisible to the human eye _ connected and allowed a piece of fuselage to blow out in an explosive decompression at 24,000 feet, followed by a whole section of the plane. The images from the April 28, 1988, accident were unforgettable: the jet, with a 18-foot chunk of its upper fuselage gone, sitting on the runway of <LOCATION> Kahului </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Hawaiian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>; stunned passengers milling around while flight attendants tried to comfort them; passengers shaking the hands of the pilot and co-pilot who somehow landed the crippled jet safely. Officials were stunned there was only one fatality, although 61 passengers were injured. Quickly the headlines changed from `` Terror in Paradise,'' to `` Miracle Over <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>.'' Experts marveled at the skill of the captain, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON>, and the co-pilot, <PERSON> Madeline </PERSON> `` Mimi'' <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON>, since promoted to captain, and praised them for averting a much worse disaster. And they wondered, of course, what could cause the 19-year-old jet to break apart. `` I saw the original hole, the smaller one before the whole thing ripped open,'' said passenger <PERSON> Arlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Clippinger </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> `` I still dream about that hole.'' After the accident, a task force of aviation industry and government safety experts recommended mandatory structural overhauls on older airliners. The average age of the nearly 3,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airliners is about 13 years, with many planes more than 15 years old. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> report on the `` in-flight roof separation'' is not due until next month. `` The accident caused everyone to question the industry folklore that a plane could fly forever,'' said <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now it's believed that airplanes can fly indefinitely with the proper life-extending programs, but that's not just daily maintenance, it's overall, complete structural inspections,'' he said. Since the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident, nine people died Feb. 24 when the cargo door and a chunk of fuselage tore off an <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 on a flight from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. Cargo door failure is suspected to be the cause of that mishap. `` Those two accidents -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> -RRB- were similar only in what you saw on TV, a jet with a hole,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>. `` The best poll of public confidence remains the fact that we have something like 16,000 airline flights every day in the country and they're pretty much full of passengers.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> this week predicted record sales for 1989, with Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> saying `` concern about aging aircraft is bound to be a significant factor'' in the company's sales outlook. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said that despite spending $ 60 million for two new 737s, defending the company against 19 lawsuits stemming from the accident and spending millions to refurbish older aircraft, the company turned a $ 5.8 million profit in 1988, up $ 200,000 from the previous year's profit. The jet involved in the accident was scrapped, and the airline no longer lists a Flight 243 in its schedule. The airline's insurance company is paying settlements to those who did not sue, <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said, but declined to release the average payment. `` In 43 years of flying we've had one accident,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. `` It happened to be one that affected the whole industry and caused widespread changes.''

<HEAD>Lawsuit Seeks Desegregation of City, Suburban Schools</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Civil rights leaders are suing the state of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> contending its schools make it impossible for poor, minority students to get the same education as their white, suburban counterparts. The desegregation lawsuit was filed Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of a black <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> fourth-grader and 16 other children and teen-agers, arguing that racial imbalance in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> area schools violates the state constitution's guarantee against racial discrimination. The lawsuit contends that black and Hispanic inner-city children and white suburban children are all suffering under greater <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>'s racially divided school systems. `` Black children going to black schools and white children going to white schools is inherently unequal,'' said <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, one of 10 lawyers who will argue the case. `` It's got to be stopped.'' The lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, 10-year-old <PERSON> Milo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheff </PERSON>, attends <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Annie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where 99 percent of the students are black or Hispanic. Six of the 17 plaintiffs in the lawsuit are white, including two children from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, an affluent suburb where schools are 84 percent white. In <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, where the other 15 plaintiffs live, schools are 91 percent black or Hispanic. The lawsuit contends that the concentration of poor children, children from one-parent families, and non-English speaking children places severe burdens on the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> school system, making it unable to provide education comparable to that offered in nearby suburbs. The lawsuit also alleges that white children in suburban school districts surrounding <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> `` are deprived of the opportunity to associate with, and learn from, the minority children attending school within the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> school district.'' The lawsuit does not ask for any specific remedy to desegregate the schools, and the lawyers who will argue the case seemed hesitant to suggest one. `` What we envision is a system whereby Puerto Ricans and blacks and whites are educated together,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Olds </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which is providing two lawyers to the plaintiffs. A court-ordered solution could focus on redrawing school district boundaries, busing students from one district to another, or creating interdistrict `` magnet'' schools. State Education Commissioner <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tirozzi </PERSON>, one of 10 state officials named as defendants, has proposed voluntary, incremental steps such as magnet schools to desegregate <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> schools. But the Legislature has not acted on <PERSON> Tirozzi </PERSON>'s suggestions, and civil rights leaders maintain the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> wo n't deal with the issue without pressure from the courts. Also named as defendants are Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, the six current members of the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, state Treasurer <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Borges </PERSON> _ the state's highest black official _ and state Comptroller <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s legal advisor, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, said Thursday the governor would have no comment on the lawsuit until he has had a chance to review it.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> held a meeting last week to discuss how to handle a transfer of presidential power if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were incapacitated, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> called the unannounced session April 18 `` just a routine meeting, just a process meeting, how the process would work.'' The 25th Amendment to the Constitution prescribes circumstances under which the vice president would assume power from the president, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> temporarily took over from former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> when he had colon cancer surgery on July 13, 1985. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Thursday that `` precise guidelines'' were adopted during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for implementing the Amendment. `` I do n't know that there's anything -LRB- more -RRB- to decide,'' he said. `` It's all very routine. The processes were worked out in the last administration.'' He said he did not recall that that process had ever been made public. On the other hand, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he recalled talking about the process when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was undergoing periodic cancer checkups. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who was traveling in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, said of the report today, `` I have absolutely no comment on that. I have no comment.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, quoting an anonymous <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> source, reported today that the meeting was kept secret because of sensitivity to previous Democratic charges that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> lacked experience to handle the job of president. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he did not know who participated in the meeting but said it was a private session. The Post reported that <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as well as <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> physician <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> II and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> also attended the meeting. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> remained silent while his wife and the Bushes questioned the White House staff members on the issue. A source familiar with the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, however, that Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did not attend the session. During the meeting, it was determined that the 25th Amendment would be invoked under certain circumstances but not in others, but the details of what was decided could not be immediately determined, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Several widows of crew members aboard the Challenger space shuttle say they are upset about plans by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> to make a three-hour television movie about the accident. <PERSON> Loran </PERSON> <PERSON> Onizuka </PERSON>, widow of Challenger astronaut <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> <PERSON> Onizuka </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, widow of Challenger pilot <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, and their attorney have talked to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Englund </PERSON>, executive producer and writer of the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> drama, in an effort to get him to drop the project. <PERSON> Englund </PERSON>, however, said the project to tell the story of the seven astronauts who died in the accident Jan. 28, 1986, will continue. `` In my heart, I've tried to understand their feeling,'' he said. `` The most honorable thing I can say is that my hopes and wishes are that it will be accurate.'' But Mrs. <PERSON> Onizuka </PERSON> said, `` They ought to let them be.'' `` Why do we have to relive this? Why do n't they leave it alone?

<TEXT>
 The consumer group <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> is getting 50 cents on the sale of each home-testing kit for radon from two companies it is recommending as the best, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader-affiliated </PERSON> group, admitted <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> is accepting the money but told the Post suggestions of a link between the payments and the favorable ratings are `` totally without even the slightest foundation.'' Public Citizen is an umbrella organization for several consumer groups. One of those groups, Buyers Up, recommended the kits produced by <ORGANIZATION> Radon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isotops </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> said. According to <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON>, Buyers Up tested seven radon-testing kits from the nation's largest manufacturers last year and asked all of the firms to contribute to Buyers Up or Public Citizen, both nonprofit groups. <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> it was only coincidence that the only firms to offer a percentage of their sales were those that won recommendations. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, a group of 33 conservative consumer and public policy groups, has joined firms that were rated poorly by Buyers Up in calling the arrangement a kickback. `` I suppose that there could be some better way of funding it,'' <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> said of the testing program. `` But we do n't have any regrets. They're seizing on this as a way to try to discredit us.'' Radon is a colorless, odorless radioactive gas that forms naturally from decay in the ground and can seep into homes.

<HEAD>Moderate Quake Felt In Six States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Dishes rattled and houses shook, but no damages or injuries were reported from an earthquake centered in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and felt in five other states, authorities said. The earthquake hit at 11:48 a.m. CDT Thursday and measured 4.7 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion. It was centered in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Blytheville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark </LOCATION>. The temblor _ in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> _ was the strongest in the region since 1976, said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Girardeau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, said the quake also was felt in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hester </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mayfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, about 20 miles north of the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> border, was perched on her roof, painting, when the earthquake hit. The quake lasted about 15 seconds. `` There was a loud boom, and about that time everything went to shaking. ... I do n't know which was shaking worse _ me or the house,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hester </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Pemiscot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivie </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> said his office had received many calls, but none reporting damage or injuries. `` They were worried because they were n't sure what it was,'' <PERSON> Ivie </PERSON> said. `` They had a pretty good idea, you know, but they wanted to make sure.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> seismic zone was the center of a series of great earthquakes that rocked the area during the winter of 1811-12. Officials have warned repeatedly that a serious earthquake can be expected during the next several years in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> seismic area, which stretches roughly from southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. Thursday's was the strongest quake in the region since March 25, 1976, when one registered 4.9, said <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. So a reading of 7.5 means an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a major earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a `` great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale was unavailable in 1811-1812, but those quakes have been estimated at 8.2 to 8.3 on the scale. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> quakes affected much of the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, felt as far away as <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, but the immediate area then was sparsely settled and there was relatively little local damage.

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lack of medicine and a shortage of hospital beds hampered treatment today of the victims of a tornado that pounded <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, leaving hundreds of people dead and thousands injured, doctors said. The Relief Ministry says at least 600 people were killed and 12,000 injured Wednesday as the tornado swept through the <LOCATION> Manikganj </LOCATION> area, 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. But local newspapers said the toll could reach 1,000. The pro-government <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted officials as saying bodies were being uncovered in the rubble of devastated houses and that several hundred of the injured were in critical condition. Doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> Dhaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an acute shortage of medicine and hospital beds was impeding treatment to the injured. They said at least 1,000 people were brought to the hospital on Wednesday with broken limbs and head injuries. `` We could only admit 225 of them,'' one doctor said. `` The rest were given emergency treatment and released. Many of them did not get proper medicine.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter saw many of the injured lying in the corridors of the 1,000-bed hospital, which is considered <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>'s largest and most modern medical facility. `` My mother needs blood and an immediate operation,'' said a sobbing <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, a 15-year-old boy. `` But no cot is available.'' His mother, <PERSON> Ameena </PERSON> <PERSON> Begum </PERSON>, lay next to him on the corridor. Doctors said she had sustained serious head injuries and was periodically losing conciousness. Her husband, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, and two other sons were killed in the tornado. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> escaped with bruises. `` This is a terrible scene,'' said <PERSON> Mostafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jala </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohiuddin </PERSON>, a doctor at the medical college. `` I have never seen so many injured people flooding the hospital at a time.'' The tornado left at least 400 people missing, including 200 fishermen who had taken their boats on the <LOCATION> Padma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. It also unleashed hailstones and heavy showers hours after President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> led nationwide prayers for rains to ease a two-month-long drought. The drought threatens to destroy more than half of the rice crop in this poverty-stricken nation. A smaller tornado blew through the <LOCATION> Narsingdi </LOCATION> district, 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, killing five people and injuring 500 others, news reports said. The government has asked for blood donations and has set up makeshift camps in the affected areas, Relief Ministry officials said. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, one of the world's poorest countries with an annual per capita income of $ 160, is often ravaged by both flood and drought. It has a population of 110 million. Summer floods last year left four-fifths of the country under water, killing at least 1,400 people. In November, cyclones claimed another 1,100 lives.

<TEXT>
 A mistake by a <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> dispatcher with 23 years experience caused the April 6 derailment of <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s Silver Star near <LOCATION> Emporia </LOCATION>, a federal investigator said. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inglis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that the dispatcher, based at <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION>'s new central dispatch center in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, had radioed the engineer that the Silver Star would be switching tracks in <LOCATION> Emporia </LOCATION> _ four miles beyond the point where the switch had been set. <LOCATION> Emporia </LOCATION> is about 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. The engineer failed to slow for the switch because he did n't expect it so soon, <PERSON> Inglis </PERSON> said The train plowed into the switch at its normal cruising speed of 59 mph instead of the recommended crossover speed of 15 mph. Both engines and the first eight cars of the 18-car train jumped the track, causing minor injuries to 34 of the train's 519 passengers and $ 1.8 million in damage. <PERSON> Inglis </PERSON> said tests found no evidence of drug or alcohol use by anyone involved in the train's routing or operation. He said the dispatcher had a perfect work record before the derailment. The man is still at his post and likely will keep his job, the investigator said. The safety board's final report on the accident, due in June, probably will recommend changes in operating procedures at the dispatch center, <PERSON> Inglis </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> has about 19,000 miles of track in 20 states plus <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Two limpet mines exploded in trash cans in downtown <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> early today, shattering store windows but causing no injuries, police said. The first explosion shortly after noon blew up a trash bin at the entrance of a local department store. It occurred across from a building housing several <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and British news organizations, including <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>. The second explosion occurred two hours later in front of a furnishing store seven blocks away. Bombings had dropped off sharply since a protest campaign last October against the racially separate nationwide municipal elections. While there had been no bombs in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> in months, several were reported in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> area and in the Xhosa tribal homelands of <LOCATION> Ciskei </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION>. Sixteen people have been injured by about 20 bombs this year. Police named no suspect for today's bombings, although they usually blame the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the largest guerrilla organization waging a sabotage campaign to end apartheid and rule by a white-dominated government. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> seldom comments on individual bombings, but they sometimes occur after an event considered significant to the organization. Three <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas were sentenced to death Thursday, and a fourth received a 25-year prison sentence in connection with four killings and two bombings that injured 17 people in 1986. The trial was in <LOCATION> Delmas </LOCATION>, a farm town northeast of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>.

 A judge must now decide the fate of a man after accepting his plea of guilty but mentally ill in the killings of two 8-year-olds during a shooting at an elementary school last fall. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, depicted as a man plagued by imaginary voices and obsessed with violence, also was found guilty but mentally ill Thursday of wounding seven other children and two teachers at <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> walked into the school on Sept. 26, 1988, and opened fire with a handgun in a cafeteria and classroom. During a hearing after the judge accepted the pleas, prosecutors asked that <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> be sentenced to the electric chair, and the defense asked for life in prison with proper psychiatric care. Circuit Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> delayed sentencing <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> until May 9. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> accepted the pleas from <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 20, after 3 -LCB- days of testimony from witnesses to the shooting and from psychiatrists who had examined him. Earlier this week, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> found <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> competent to stand trial. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who has a history of mental illness, offered a plea of guilty but mentally ill to the charges on Monday. But <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> refused to immediately accept the pleas, saying he wanted to hear testimony on the defendant's state of mind. Psychiatrists testified that <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was a man obsessed by the film, `` Psycho,'' which <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> claimed to have seen 500 times, fascinated by mass murderers and how they carried out their crimes, and plagued by the voice of his dead grandfather. Psychiatrists called by the defense this week testified that <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> suffered from a borderline personality disorder, which involves a potential for violence, low self-esteem, paranoia, inability to develop interpersonal relationships and suicidal tendencies. Prosecutors tried to dispel testimony that supported <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s contention he was mentally ill at the time of the shootings in an effort to send the case to a jury trial

 A strong earthquake jolted central <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> today but no damage or injuries were reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Athens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said the quake, which occurred at 7:02 a.m., measured 5.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and was centered in the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, about 85 miles north of the capital. `` We felt the quake but we had no reports of damage or injuries,'' said a police officer in the central Greek port of <LOCATION> Volos </LOCATION>. The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity in accordance with <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> practice, said, `` We have many Easter visitors here and at the nearby islands and fortunately there was no panic.'' More than 1 million Athenians have left the capital to spend the weekend of the Greek Orthodox Easter in the countryside, police said. A quake measuring 5.0 can cause considerable damage if its epicenter is in a populated area. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times greater.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, acting like a political candidate on a whistlestop tour of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, quaffed beer at a local pub, hit tennis balls with underprivileged children and mingled with crowds in two cities today. Obviously enjoying himself on the third day of his trip, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> paid a surprise visit to the wood-paneled pub at the <LOCATION> Lord </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nelson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brewery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> where his brief stop stunned the clientele. `` I could n't believe it,'' said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivey </PERSON>, a banker who was drinking at the bar with friends in mid-afternoon. `` We were standing here and he walked up and said, ` Hi. I'm <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.''' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, sipping a glass of <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> beer, chatted with the young women behind the bar, joked with proprietor <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> about his golfing tie and suggested two patrons attend a black-tie dinner at which he's the guest of honor. He called the beer _ which is <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s national drink _ good, but added, `` It has a bite.'' <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, 25, an administrator at <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> who chatted with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` It was great. He is really nice.'' She said her friends `` will be spewing. They'll be so jealous.'' The pub stop capped a day in which <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spent much of his time shaking hands and posing for pictures, including several on a boat tour of <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>'s breathtaking harbor. The good-natured touring was in contrast to the first days of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s first trip to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> region. The vice president has highlighted the U.S.-Australia defense alliance, but <LOCATION> Australian </LOCATION> officials have protested export subsidies the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> places on wheat, subsidies the Australians say hurt their exports abroad. Australian officials who hoped <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would say the subsidies were ending were angered at his public comments. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said at a news conference on Thursday, `` We do not believe that it -LRB- the subsidy program -RRB- is injuring <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>.'' Senior government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> was exasperated at <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s stance in a private meeting. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said on Thursday that the losses `` are not figments of our imagination. They are cold, hard and brutally hurtful economic statistics which have adversely affected our farmers, our wheat farmers.'' The country's major national newspaper, The Australian, was more blunt in an editorial, saying, `` Who do you think you are kidding, Mr. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>? Read our lips, Mr. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Australians are not happy.'' The vice president and his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, flew here from <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, their second stop on their five-day trip to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Taking a cue from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who sometimes spontaneously stops his motorcade to mix with the crowds, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> jumped out of his limousine in downtown <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION> to shake hands outside one of the city's landmarks, the clocks at the <LOCATION> Flinders </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> train station. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, trailed by local reporters, also insisted on walking near the waterfront in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, much to the consternation of his <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents. `` I wish he would get in the car,'' one agent said in an exasperated tone. Before he left <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> laid a wreath at a war memorial where a brass plaque honors <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines who fought at <LOCATION> Guadalcanal </LOCATION> in World War II. He also stopped by the National Tennis Center, home of the Australian Open, to honor Oz Tennis, a charity that gives poor children the chance to learn the game. The vice president hit tennis balls there with former Wimbledon doubles champion <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamee </PERSON> and 11-year-old <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Memedev </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 One of history's most notorious naval revolts, the mutiny on the <LOCATION> Bounty </LOCATION>, was re-enacted today in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seas </LOCATION> by descendants of Capt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON> and his rebellious first officer, <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>. `` It was a wonderful moment, the ghosts of <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> were with us today,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bligh-Ware </PERSON>, whose great-great-great-grandfather was set adrift off the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island nation of <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION> on April 28, 1789. `` Today was probably the most jovial mutiny in history,'' the 62-year-old <PERSON> Bligh-Ware </PERSON> added. `` We popped champagne corks and it was fun.'' <PERSON> Bligh-Ware </PERSON>'s had only to circumnavigate his ship _ a replica of the Bounty built from British admiralty charts _ in a long boat. His famous ancestor, forced from his ship, was joined by 18 loyal crewmen who sailed a 23-foot open boat about 4,200 miles in 47 days to <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, in what is still regarded as a remarkable feat. Christian sailed the Bounty back to <LOCATION> Tahiti </LOCATION> and then spent months searching the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> for a haven, knowing he would be hanged if caught. The mutineers eventually settled on <LOCATION> Pitcairn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, one of the world's most remote settlements. There they burned the ship. Their descendants moved to <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, off the east coast of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, in the 1850s. Some later returned to <LOCATION> Pitcairn </LOCATION> and the populations of both islands to this day are predominantly of mutineer ancestry. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosebery </PERSON>, owner of the replica <PERSON> Bounty </PERSON>, organized the re-enactment about 2,100 miles east of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>.

 Two inmates and three other people tried to extort $ 10,000 from the parents of a college student whose mutilated body later was found in a mass grave in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, authorities said. The <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail inmates were arrested Thursday and accused of using jail telephones to call <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s parents in nearby <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where they were awaiting word on the whereabouts of their son, who vanished in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said a caller vowed to cut off the missing student's fingers and mail them to the family if police arrested or followed people to whom the <ORGANIZATION> Kilroys </ORGANIZATION> delivered ransom money. The body of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> junior was found in a shallow grave near <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, on April 11, one week after the extortion attempt allegedly began. The body had been mutilated in a human sacrifice ritual by Mexican drug smugglers, police said. Police said the inmates and the other three people were not believed to be involved with the cult, but had heard <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> was missing and were trying to cash in on it. The inmates were being held on burglary charges at the time of the alleged extortion plot, officers said. `` We were absolutely shocked that people who are in prison for a good reason are able to call out and terrorize innocent people,'' said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>. `` We were really shocked that people can be terrorized from inside our jails.'' The other three people also were arrested, and all five were charged with attempted robbery and ordered held in lieu of $ 20,000 bail. <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>'s mother apparently tried to pay the initial $ 2,000 the group sought, but the payoff was not made, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> Deputy <PERSON> Gean </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said the inmates had telephones in their cells to be used to contact family members or their attorneys. The telephones allow the inmate to make collect calls only, he said.

<HEAD>Poll Gives President Bush A `C' Grade For First 100 Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If the White House can be compared to a schoolhouse, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> earned a `` C'' during his first 100 days, according to a poll published today. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s predecessor, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, got a `` B'' in a similar poll the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> conducted after his first 100 days in office. However, the newspaper noted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s popularity was bolstered by an assassination attempt 70 days after he entered the Oval Office. The poll also found that 47 percent of those interviewed `` approve of the way <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is handling his job as president.'' Eighteen percent said they disapprove, and 35 percent said they have no opinion. The newspaper said that at the same juncture in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency, 80 percent of those surveyed approved of the former president's job performance When people were asked, `` What kind of a grade would you give President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>?'' the result was a `` C'' average. The survey, conducted by Times pollster I.A. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, interviewed a random sample of 2,160 people nationwide for four days, ending last Tuesday. The newspaper said the margin of error was 3 percentage points in either direction. Sixty-seven percent of those polled have a positive impression of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 20 percent unfavorable and 13 percent unsure. One hundred days into <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term in 1981, 83 percent of those surveyed said they had an overall positive impression of him. The poll found that 52 percent of those surveyed disapproved of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s handling of the Alaskan oil spill, 25 percent voiced approval and the remainder were unsure. On other issues, 34 percent approved of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s steps to control semiautomatic weapons, and 26 percent disapproved; 24 percent approved of his handling of the savings and loan crisis, and 27 percent disapproved. The total added up to more than 100 percent because of multiple responses.

<HEAD>Chinese Renew Pledge To Halt Aid To Rebels In Cambodia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A senior <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> official has renewed pledges to halt military aid to guerrillas in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> after the total pullout of Vietnamese troops, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said today. Meanwhile, exiled <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> today rejected proposals for general elections following the Sept. 30 withdrawal of the estimated 50,000-70 ,000 Vietnamese troops from his country as `` illegal and absolutely unacceptable. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, in a written statement, said <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s plan to have all troops leave <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by the end of September was a `` farce,'' because the Vietnamese-backed government of Premier <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> remains in power. Vietnamese forces invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978, ousting the pro-Chinese <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime that massacred hundreds of thousands of Cambodians. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, toppled from power in a 1970 coup, now heads a coalition of three resistance groups that includes the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s government has reportedly said it will hold general elections within three months after the Vietnamese withdrawal. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, who will meet <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> May 2-3, discounted the validity of any the elections. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s government is `` nothing but a creation and creature of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' that `` has no right to to organize ` general elections,''' he said <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> has said the Vietnamese withdrawal from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> should be supervised by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and that <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s government should be dissolved prior to a general election, demands the Cambodian premier has rejected. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> said a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> vice foreign minister made the pledge to halt military aid when he received a copy of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s April 5 declaration of a total withdrawal. <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> did not name the vice minister. `` They say they will stop once the Vietnamese are all withdrawn, then they will stop their military aid,'' <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> said, adding he was confident the pledge would be kept. <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Dinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Nho </PERSON> <PERSON> Liem </PERSON> will go to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for a second round of talks to try to resolve differences over <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The talks are to be held May 8-10. The first round, held in January, was the first high-level meeting between the two countries in more than nine years. Sino-Vietnamese relations have been strained since the 1970s over border conflicts, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s ties with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is the main supplier of arms to a guerrilla coalition fighting Vietnamese troops that invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978. Thach spoke with reporters while attending a symposium in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on turning <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> into a peaceful trading zone once the conflict over <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is resolved.

 Hours after <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> showed off its beach-cleaning effort to reporters, an oil company executive got an earful when he tried to convince a fishing community that things were looking better. Exxon got good reviews from a state geologist who watched <LOCATION> Smith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> being prepared for pregnant seals. But citizens of <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> let <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Luyesse </PERSON> <PERSON> LeGrange </PERSON> know they do n't see the same progress. <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>, one of 300 people at <ORGANIZATION> Cordova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s gym Thursday night to talk with <PERSON> LeGrange </PERSON> and others coordinating the spill cleanup, disputed <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s claims about the number of skimmers it operates. When <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said 19 were working in the sound, an overflight by pilots for the <ORGANIZATION> Cordova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishermen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> found only three, she said. Another occasion <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said it had 45 skimmers at work and the union found only five. `` When can we expect to see the situation improve?'' asked <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>, a member of the fishermen's union. `` I hardly think that's the case with all the equipment we have out there,'' <PERSON> LeGrange </PERSON> said. `` I'd be most suprised if we have equipment not working.'' After a slow start with officials questioning each other, the two-hour meeting began to get lively as the audience was allowed to join the inquiry. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>, the state's chief environmentalist, said, `` There has been a long pattern of claims by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> that do n't bear out when people go look at what's happening.'' <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> said he was n't accusing LeGrange of lying, but that `` nobody believes'' the company's recent announcement that the shoreline cleanup was ahead of schedule _ a mention that drew laughs from the audience. `` I can tell you this is not a technical issue, not a biological issue or an economic issue,'' <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> continued. `` It's a moral issue. Until Exxon steps up to their moral responsibility and stops trying to shift blame to somebody else we're going to have problems getting the kind of performance we all expect, whether it's in the water or on the shore.'' <PERSON> LeGrange </PERSON> denied there was any shifting of blame. `` But perhaps there's some sharing that needs to be considered,'' he said. `` In the end, the truth will come out in hearings, in court rooms where people are testifying under oath and subject to cross examination.'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> hearings on the accident and the emergency response have been set for May 16-19 in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. The tone of the town meeting was sharp but polite, a contrast to the first meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials and <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> residents dependent on fishing in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> for their livelihood. At the earlier meeting, speakers were interrupted and there was considerable shouting. The confrontation occurred shortly after the Exxon Valdez wrecked on <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> and put more than 10 millions of oil into the sound. The newly arrived USS Juneau sent its first crews to beaches on <LOCATION> Smith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Thursday, with reporters on hand to watch water hoses turned on the thick, black goop coating the rocks. Standing on the beach was difficult. A shoreline three football fields long should take about three days to clean, said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON>, a field manager for the cleanup. But a worker struggling to maintain his footing on the beach's oil-slickened rocks disagreed It takes 10 or 15 minutes of high-pressure spraying to wash the oil off a rubber work suit, said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON>, who joined the cleanup crew for nearly $ 17 an hour after his work as a fishermen was imperiled by the spill. `` And they say they're going to have this beach cleaned in three days,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` I'd call that extremely optimistic.''

 At the Xidan intersection near the city's center, workers and unemployed youths broke through a line of about 200 police to help students maintain their pro-democracy march to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. `` We're opening a road for them,'' said one worker, carrying one of his shoes, which had fallen off during the scuffle. `` The people outnumber the students now.'' Just west of the central square, hundreds of workers surrounded the final line of security forces. `` Give way to the students!'' they shouted, their voices bouncing off the red-brick walls of the <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. As the officers' ranks folded, the crowd broke out cheering. Defying threats that they might lose their jobs, thousands of workers on Thursday took part in the 20-mile student march, swelling the number of participants to 150,000. `` If <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s children have the courage to come out, then its fathers do, too,'' said a middle-aged electrician as he marched with his colleagues. `` We're all taking sick days.'' Scores of workers at the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> handed marchers dumplings and drinks. At a construction site nearby, work stopped temporarily and workers waved from atop a 15-story building. Workers packed every corner, sitting atop buildings, billoards and subway entrances. `` Long live students! Struggle till the end!'' they chanted as the crowd moved by. The spontaneous action was an indication of widespread opposition to the government. It also bore testimony to student efforts earlier this week to bring their case to the people. `` The government should not stop people from speaking,'' said an elderly dentist. `` I'm too old to push soldiers, but I can still walk with them.'' `` My factory may fire me but I do n't care,'' said a foreman at a bus plant, as he walked near the head of the protest. `` These kids need help, and I'm here to provide it.'' Student protests began last week following the April 15 death of ousted <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>. Workers did not start appearing in the throngs until Saturday, when 150,000 students and their supporters occupied Tiananmen Square during <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s funeral, calling for a free press and an end to corruption in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. But they did not start actively participating until Thursday. Since the Saturday protest, bands of student activists on street corners have given speeches and collected money for their protest. Workers said they agreed with student opposition to corruption, nepotism and special privileges. Many senior officials in state-run factories engage in corruption, making huge profits while their employees live on fixed salaries. `` I read one of their leaflets and it made sense,'' said a young driver. `` I know the party leader in my company is corrupt and the students want a clean government.'' Some workers said they would keep on supporting the students, but it was unclear to what extent. `` Do you know what this is?'' one worker asked. `` It is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> standing up.''

<HEAD>Cease-Fire Takes Effect In Lebanon</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Seven weeks of fierce fighting between Christian and Moslem forces stopped today under a cease-fire called by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. But an apparent disagreement over a key provision of the truce regarding blockades of the country's ports threatened to undermine the cease-fire. The latest round of fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year civil war began on March 8 and has killed 273 people and wounded 993, according to police. The 22-member Arab League worked out the cease-fire plan Thursday during a meeting in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and promised to dispatch <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> observers to monitor the truce. Three previous cease-fires sponsored by the league have collapsed. Earlier today, <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> was shaken by several rocket and artillery blasts as <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army units under Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> battled with Syrians and their Druse Moslem militia allies along the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> that slices <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> into Christian and Moslem sectors. No casualties were reported, police said. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads a three-man <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> cabinet, said he welcomed the `` lifting of blockades imposed on legal ports besieged by the Syrian forces.'' He said in a statement that maritime agencies should `` instruct their ships to head to legal ports,'' apparently meaning that <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> still did not intend to end his blockade of illegal ports runs by Moslem militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The latest round of fighting began when <PERSON> Auon </PERSON> ordered his forces to blockade those ports on March 6 in an effort to restore government authority. The Druse Moslems responded by opening fire on the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces control. The Syrians then joined in shelling and besieged Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and a 310-square-mile Christian enclave to the north. Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads a mainly Moslem cabinet that is at odds with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s government, also pledged to observe the cease-fire. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> SANA </ORGANIZATION> said the government of President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> was `` satisified with resolutions announced by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> initially sent its 40,000 troops into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1976 on a peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> for weeks had rejected any settlement that did not include a timetable for <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s withdrawal from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. An aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> agreed to the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire because it included the Arab observers, whose presence could curb <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s influence. `` This, of course, is not enough. However, it is a good step in the march toward stripping <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> of its total control over <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' the spokesman said. The <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> daily newspaper An-Nahar said the main achievement of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> decision is that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> `` no longer is the sole power in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s final statement did not say how many observers would be sent to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Newspapers and <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> sources have said a special committee it formed in January proposed dispatching 312 observers under a Kuwaiti commander. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> heads the committee, which also includes the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the country's only air transport facility located on the southern edge of the Moslem sector, has been closed since March 12, when it became a target of Christian gunners. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said today it could reopen. But a source close to <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said the airport would remain closed until the <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> cabinet decides to reopen it.

<TEXT>
 Prosecutors today demanded a life sentence for <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> for his role in the hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> plane and the slaying of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sailor. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and air piracy in the June 1985 hijacking. He admitted taking part in the hijacking but denies killing <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. In closing arguments, chief prosecutor <PERSON> Achim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiel </PERSON> said although it could not be proved <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> pulled the trigger of the gun that killed <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, `` it was a clear case, at a minimum, of felony murder.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Korneck </PERSON>, the assistant prosecutor in the trial, which opened July 5, 1988, said: `` It was an attack against the foundations of civilization.'' `` There was no excuse for what happened. It can not be justified or excused,'' <PERSON> Korneck </PERSON> said, referring to the hijacking, <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s murder and the brutal beatings of passengers `` There was nothing in the evidence presented that would justify a milder sentence,'' <PERSON> Korneck </PERSON> said. Thirty-nine Americans were held hostage 17 days after the jet was commandeered while on a flight from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. A verdict is not expected until the second half of May. Life imprisonment is the maximum penalty for murder and air piracy in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Under West German law, an accomplice can be convicted of murder even if he did not pull the trigger. `` It can not be proved that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> killed <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> with his own hands. But he is at a minimum equally guilty,'' <PERSON> Thiel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has blamed his fugitive accomplice, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezzeddine </PERSON>, for <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s murder. None of the witnesses who testified during the trial, including dozens of former hostages and crew members of the hijacked plane, saw the slaying. In their closing arguments, the prosecutors referred repeatedly to the beatings of passengers described by witnesses. `` <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Suggs </PERSON> -LRB- another <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver -RRB- when they were totally defenseless,'' <PERSON> Thiel </PERSON> said. `` They were beaten without reason. He did it out of hate.'' `` He beat <PERSON> Suggs </PERSON> until the skin on his back popped open,'' the chief prosecutor said. `` The sadistic beating of <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> -LRB- another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passenger -RRB- until he was unconscious was verified by other witnesses. They believed that <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> was dead.'' `` We demand life imprisonment for murder and three cases of grave bodily harm. The murder, the brutal beatings of <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, <PERSON> Suggs </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> call for a life sentence,'' <PERSON> Korneck </PERSON> said. Both prosecutors described <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> as the leader of the hijacking. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has denied being the leader. The prosecutors also argued that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> should be treated and sentenced as an adult. According to evidence obtained by the prosecutors, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> turned 21 the day before the hijacking began on June 14, 1985. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has claimed that he is one or two years younger but has not given a precise date of birth. Under West German law, the age issue could influence the length of sentence. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, and their other two sons, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, listened closely to the proceedings. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested in January 1988 at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s airport when customs officials found explosives in his luggage.

 In a little-noticed decision, a federal appeals court challenged the right of historians and biographers to reprint letters, diaries and other unpublished primary source material without permission.

<HEAD>Solidarity Debuts On State Radio</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With a mixture of political commentary, music and snippets of history, Solidarity debuted on state radio today under an agreement that gives the trade union limited access to mass media. `` We return to the air after long years,'' said one of the three hosts, all Solidarity activists. The taped program began with religious and union songs interspersed with fragments from historical events, including the sound of cheers that greeted an April 17 court ruling making Solidarity legal again after a seven-year ban. It also had man-in-the-street interviews about the return of Solidarity and political commentary by opposition theorist <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>. It ended with an appeal by another opposition politician, <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamentowicz </PERSON>, asking people not to boycott June parliamentary elections in which opposition candidates are to participate for the first time since 1947. `` We will elect in June. Yes, elect,'' he said. `` For the first time in many years we will elect and not just vote. So the conclusion that a boycott serves any cause makes no sense at all.'' <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> discussed the opposition's program in the election campaign. `` The goal ... is sovereignty of the nation, independence and improvement of the republic,'' he said. He stressed that the opposition's agreement with authorities that guarantees the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its allies a 65 percent majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, the existing parliament chamber, applied only to this year's vote. `` The next elections should be free,'' he declared. The radio show was broadcast at 11 a.m. on Radio One, the main channel of state radio. Another broadcast was planned Tuesday on another channel and a third was scheduled for May 12. The melody at the opening of the program was composed especially for Solidarity by well-known composer <PERSON> Wlodzimierz </PERSON> <PERSON> Korcz </PERSON>, an announcer said. Access to the mass media was guaranteed the opposition under the accord reached April 5 between communist authorities and the Solidarity-led opposition. The agreement contains political and social reforms aimed primarily at reviving the country's declining economy. In addition to a half-hour weekly on radio, there is to be a half-hour weekly television broadcast. Printing of the first opposition mass-circulation daily newspaper is planned next week. All the opposition broadcasts and publications will be subject to the same state censorship as the government media. Four months after martial law was imposed in December 1981 to crush the union, the Solidarity underground began organizing brief clandestine radio broadcasts from time to time at various FM frequencies using hidden transmitters. Sometimes they even would broadcast on state television during the news. However, the broadcast range was limited, and officials soon learned how to jam the transmissions with loud disco music.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Scholastic Aptitude Test Biased Against Girls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sex-biased questions on the Scholastic Aptitude Test taken by millions of college-bound students are causing girls to lose admission to selective schools, scholarships and self-image, a researcher says. <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosser </PERSON> said Thursday she studied the answers of 100,000 students on the November 1987 SAT. Of the 145 questions, she pinpointed 23 in which one sex did at least 10 percent better than the other. Boys did better in all but two, she said. `` These questions are tipping the balance. As a result, four years of high school achievement go down the drain. They're wiped out by a three-hour test,'' said <PERSON> Rosser </PERSON>, a senior research associate at the Center for Women Policy Studies. Her study was financed by a federal grant under the Women's Educational Equity Act. The SAT, administered by the private <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, is taken annually by 1.5 million students, 52 percent of them girls. In 1988, average female scores were 13 points lower than male scores on the verbal section of the test and 43 points lower on the math section. The major purpose of the SAT is to predict first-year college grades. However, <PERSON> Rosser </PERSON> said studies show that females earn higher average grades than males in both high school and first-year college classes. <PERSON> Rosser </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> ETS </ORGANIZATION> has a bias-screening process but does not make its results available to researchers or the public. She said her study is the first to identify specific questions that create a gender gap. For the verbal section, she said an example of a male-biased question would be `` Dividends are to stockholders ...'' with the answer being `` as royalties are to writers.'' A question favoring females would be `` Love is to requite ...,'' with the answer being `` as attack is to retaliate.'' While the verbal section would be easy to balance, <PERSON> Rosser </PERSON> said, problems in the math questions that produced a substantial scoring discrepancy were not as obvious. The SAT is `` underpredicting the performance of 780,000 girls every year,'' she said. `` Why are we letting this happen to girls?'' <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> ETS </ORGANIZATION> admissions testing program, defended the SAT's accuracy as a predictor and said slightly lower grade point averages for male freshmen were due to tough grading by math and science professors in courses more likely to be taken by males. In general, she said, `` almost all of these score differences reflect valid academic differences between men and women taking the test.'' <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said, however, that <ORGANIZATION> ETS </ORGANIZATION> has recently begun to adjust the SAT. `` We are throwing out questions that show they're unusually difficult for men or unusually difficult for women. We also do it for ethnic groups,'' she said. The first test developed that way was given last March and results are not yet in, she said. <PERSON> Rosser </PERSON> said the consequences of the gender gap include loss of scholarships to girls _ chief among them <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholarships </ORGANIZATION> awarded to students who score highest on the Preliminary SAT -LRB- PSAT -RRB- in their junior year of high school. In addition, she said, the test scores affect women's chances of admission to 1,500 colleges and universities that use SAT cutoffs as an admission standard and they limit access to gifted and talented programs that colleges offer to high school students.

<HEAD>Church Leaders Urge Compromise on Women Bishops</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For Release 10 a.m. EDT, Time Set by Source</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A church commission today urged that the world's 70 million Anglicans concentrate on what unites them and avoid further divisions over the issue of women bishops `` Bishops should take every opportunity to emphasize their fundamental agreement on matters of faith,'' it said. The Archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, assigned the commission to report on how the unity of the 27 self-governing Anglican churches in 164 countries can be preserved in the face of the disagreement. The dispute deepened in February when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Episcopalians consecrated <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> as the first Anglican female bishop, in their <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> diocese. The 18,000-word document, `` Report of the Archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Communion and Women in the Episcopate,'' was published simultaneously in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, where the Anglican primates met to consider that and other issues. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> said in a letter to <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> that the insistence of some Anglican churches on having women priests and bishops appeared to block progress toward Catholic-Anglican reconciliation. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> retains an all-male priesthood, and it split with the <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the 16th century Reformation. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, spiritual head of the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and world Anglican leader, will meet with the pope in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> Sept. 29-Oct. 2, primarily to discuss unity of their churches, a consultation their predecessors began in 1966 The commission's report dismissed suggestions that a diocese divided on women bishops might have two bishops catering to opposing views. `` The bishop is an embodiment and agent of unity and continuity in the church,'' the report said. It stressed that bishops must take care not to become focal points of dissent in dioceses that are split on the issue. The report recommended that in dioceses with strong views for and against women priests and bishops, a compromise first worked out by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Episcopalians should be adopted. The compromise allows any congregation rejecting a woman bishop to petition for a male `` Episcopal visitor'' bishop to administer confirmations. `` Provision for <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> visitors is a way of exercising pastoral care,'' said the unanimous report written by six ordained men and an English woman theologian. It proposed that women bishops ordaining priests should do so collegially with a male bishop to meet the objections of church members who feel they could not recognize the ordinations of a woman. `` That would protect the interests of the person ordained and the communities in which he or she may minister in the future,'' the report said. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> set up the commission at the request of the Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops in August, when they knew that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Episcopalians, who have ordained more than 1,200 women to the priesthood, were preparing to approve the first woman bishop. The conference declared that practical pastoral arrangements would have to be made in all Anglican churches and dioceses for those unable to accept women bishops. The majority of Anglican churches, including the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, still rejects women priests. A number of Anglican bishops have said they might reluctantly accept women priests, but could never accept a woman bishop because it is against belief and tradition. They say it was no accident that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> chose only men as disciples. Archbishop of Armagh <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Eames </PERSON>, who chaired the commission, said the different views on women bishops were reflected by its members, who met for nine days of talks in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in November and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in March. The other commission members were Bishop <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adetiloye </PERSON>, Primate of All <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>; Archbishop <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Perth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>; Bishop <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, Bishop <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wakefield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>; the Rev.

<HEAD>Chinese Banned From Chinese Restaurant In South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOKSBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The town council has banned <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people from a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurant leased by a Chinese woman in the city's whites-only park, legislators said today. `` I feel like I'm on another planet. It's hard to believe,'' said <PERSON> Issy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, a legislator who voted against the ban. The council, dominated by the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, passed the law 10-7 Thursday night. Other non-whites had already been prohibited from entering the resaurant. The Conservatives won control of this town east of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> last year. They declared <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> a whites-only area, except for the black maintenance men who clean it. Other municipal facilities also were declared off-limits to all but whites. The lease for the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restaurant </ORGANIZATION>, run by a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> woman, is due to expire May 31, and an item on Thursday's meeting agenda called for the lease to be granted to another Chinese woman, S.Y. <PERSON> Yip </PERSON>. `` But a paragraph in the agreement says only white people may enter the restaurant,'' said <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>. `` I said, ` I know you people are forbidding blacks, coloreds and Indians from entering the park and lake, but <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> must be allowed to use the restaurant.''' The Conservatives said Mrs. <PERSON> Yip </PERSON>'s family may go to the restaurant if they receive special permission. Earlier in the week, Nationalists teamed up with Conservatives in the nearby town of <LOCATION> Benoni </LOCATION> to allow blacks to use the reference section of the municipal library, but not the lending section. The issue had come up when two private schools, which have non-white pupils, applied for permission to use the library. Arguing that the whole library should be reserved for whites, <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Koen </PERSON> said white taxpayers had built the library. `` The more blacks are educated the greater the influx will be. Whites will find it difficult to read peacefully or study in the library,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> motion was defeated 13-6. Then the Conservatives and Nationalists agreed to open the reference section to non-whites on a vote of 13-5, with one abstention.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> ISLAMABAD </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> _ Afghan guerrillas claimed today they captured three army posts and killed more than 100 soldiers in an attack on a strategic valley near the besieged city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Deen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON>, national security minister of the insurgents' provisional government, said the guerrillas fighting in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> overran the <LOCATION> Chaprahar </LOCATION> valley and pushed to within 2 -LCB- miles of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> airport The attack, which reportedly concentrated on the Afghan army's 81st Regiment, coincided with the 11th anniversary of a bloody military coup in which the communists seized power in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> Guerrillas captured three major army posts and 34 small ones, and destroyed eight tanks and captured five, <PERSON> Deen </PERSON> said in a statement. It gave no details of guerrilla casualties. But one pro-guerrilla source said the `` heavy fighting left several people dead on both sides.'' <PERSON> Deen </PERSON>'s statement claimed the insurgents killed as many as 125 government troops since Tuesday and captured 44, including four officers. Afghan government forces have been defending <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> against a guerrilla offensive since March 6. The city is 40 miles from the border with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where the insurgents have their headquarters. The siege is the first major offensive by Moslem guerrillas since Soviet troops completed their withdrawal on Feb. 15 and ended their nine year intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s civil war. Government security forces still hold key cities. But the insurgents, backed mainly by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, reportedly control more than 90 percent of the ravaged countryside. <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, with a prewar population of 67,000, would give the guerrillas a strategic foothold to launch an attack on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, 70 miles to the west, and advance their fight to establish an Islamic republic.

 The juvenile justice system is too soft on the kind of brutal, senseless crimes committed by a gang of youths who beat and gang-raped a 28-year-old woman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> last week, a congressman says. `` What we're saying is, If you're going to do big-boy crime, you're going to do big-boy time,'' Rep. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, said at a news conference Thursday in which he called for harsher penalties for violent juvenile offenders. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, a former state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice, was joined by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Crime to discuss how the attack April 19 in Central Park highlights the need for changing the juvenile justice system. `` I can tell you that we have a juvenile justice system that is modeled basically for the middle class,'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said. `` The children of folks like us, the children of the middle class who may get into trouble with shoplifting at a young age, they may throw a rock through a window, that's where the juvenile justice system works. `` But the system does not work, and it's no deterrent, and it's no protection and should n't be for the kinds of kids who did what happened in Central Park. But according to news accounts, the youths suspected of committing the Central Park assault were average city kids. Teachers called them good students, and one principal said of two of the boys: `` They come from homes of parents who care, parents who are as shocked as we are.'' Four of the suspects lived in a building with a doorman, one played tuba in the school band, another was described by teachers and classmates as a talented artist. The congressmen said they were unhappy that in many states youngsters who commit violent crimes such as rape, armed robbery, murder or attempted murder get little more than a slap on the wrist. `` What would happen in my home state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> if a 13 - and a 14 - and a 15-year-old were tried and convicted of kidnapping, rape, attempted murder and so forth asked Rep. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>. `` The answer is absolutely nothing more than reform school, and be told not to do it again. ... We believe that's based upon an erroneous assumption that juveniles in all cases are not responsible for their actions.'' The task force is hoping by the end of the year to create model state legislation `` that would cause the most violent of juvenile offenders to receive the full punishment for their actions if they're convicted,'' said <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, a former district attorney. The task force would strongly urge states to pass the model legislation, he said. And <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said he hoped to pass his own `` carrot and stick'' bill that would withhold federal money for juvenile justice from states that fail to adopt their model. In outlining their ideas for this model legislation, none of the congressmen raised the possibility of rehabilitating violent offenders. Asked whether they were not writing off these youths, <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> said: `` In the many years that I was a criminal prosecutor and briefly a defense attorney, I met individuals who I would call rehabilitated. There was a common thread running through each of them: they rehabilitated themselves.'' Rep. <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Mo </LOCATION>., said he sometimes eats breakfast with the guards from the federal prison in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION> `` Several of them have indicated to me that in their judgment, some people are just plain mean and never should be released back on society,'' he said. `` There's not anything anybody's going to be able to do about it.''

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar moved higher today against the Japanese yen, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed at another high. The dollar finished the week at 132.49 yen, up 0.44 yen from Thursday's closing of 132.05 yen. After opening higher at 132.20 yen, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency ranged from 132.20 to 132.60 yen during the day. Currency dealers said participants purchased the dollar because today was the last trading day of the month and because of a lower-than-expected rise in Tokyo-area consumer prices. Consumer prices in the capital area in April were 2.6 percent higher than a year earlier and 1.4 percent higher than the previous month, reducing concern over a possible tightening of credit by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Shinichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Maruyama </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>. A 3 percent sales tax went into effect April 1. In a news conference today, Finance Minister <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murayama </PERSON> said the nation's central bank was worried about price stability and high oil prices. But the tone of his remarks suggested there would not be an immediate change in monetary policy, traders said. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> said Thursday the central bank would act swiftly, if necessary, to sustain price stability. On the stock exchange, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which gained 65.90 points Thursday, added an additional 212.52 points, or 0.63 percent. That brought the average as the week closed to a record 33,713.35. The rise followed a 29.88-point rise in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight. `` Shares were bought on a broad front, because of prospects for a continuing rise in prices,'' said a stock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the stock market had already taken into account a possible 0.5 percentage point rise in the discount rate, the rate the central bank charges on loans to commercial banks. The discount rate has a strong impact on other interest rates. Higher interest rates tend to make a country's currency more attractive to investors.

<HEAD>Governor Says Louisiana's Future Rides On Tax Referendum</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The future of a state that masks its poverty with an image of fun, food and crooked politics rides on a Saturday referendum to give <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> the power to change its tax system, Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s plan shifts the tax base, putting more of a load on consumers and giving businesses incentives to move into the state and expand. The plan also includes a $ 1.4 billion program to improve highways, airports and shipping ports. The transportation portion would be funded by a gasoline tax increase of 4 cents a gallon. If the referendum is defeated, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> would have to cut more than $ 600 million from an already tight budget, which <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said is impossible. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> has touted the plan as a way of creating jobs in a state that has the nation's highest unemployment rate and ending <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s dependence on the petroleum industry. The governor, who took office 13 months ago with a pledge to erase what lawmakers have called the state's banana republic image, wo n't predict victory. `` What frightens me are those who might not look at the plan at all and be persuaded by something else in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> politics _ old wars, old wounds, old alliances, business as usual,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said Thursday. He said he also feared that opponents he did not name might spread `` street money,'' a term for vote buying, but he would n't elaborate Two polls conducted over the past week vary in their results. One poll showed 48 percent of 812 voters questioned backing the plan, with 28 percent opposed and 25 percent undecided, with numbers rounded and a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 points. A second poll says it's too close to call: Of 750 voters questioned, 40 percent were for the plan, 38 percent against, and 22 percent undecided, with a 3.6-point margin of error. Secretary of State <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeithen </PERSON> said he expects more than 40 percent of the state's 2 million registered voters to cast ballots on the proposed constitutional amendment giving the Legislature the power to change the tax system. The plan, promoted by businesses and other proponents in a $ 1 million blitz of television and radio spots, newspaper ads and mailed circulars, would cost an extra $ 126 million over the current tax load. Opponents, however, point out that as of July 1, the tax load increase is $ 526 million. Last summer, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> approved a one-year sales tax increase of $ 500 million to avoid government bankruptcy. The increase, in the form of canceling longtime exemptions on purchases of food and utilities, will expire July 1. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s package keeps about $ 400 million of that tax on a permanent basis. `` White man speak with forked tongue,'' state Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>. `` He says the plan is -LRB- almost -RRB- tax neutral without the gas tax but if it does n't pass, he says we'll have a $ 600 million deficit. He ca n't have it both ways.'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> leader, was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in February and became the most vocal of the tax opponents, who have raised about $ 60,000 to fight the plan.

 A car driven by a Palestinian blew up today on a busy shopping street near <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s police headquarters, and authorities said the explosion may have been a terrorist attack that failed. The driver was badly burned, but no other injuries were reported. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, masked attackers shot and killed a Palestinian in the crowded main square in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said the victim was accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Eleven other Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with army troops and Jewish settlers in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, according to the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports. The army confirmed the incident in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> but said it was investigating the circumstances. Military spokesmen said the army was checking reports of other injuries. Police spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said police believe the sedan that burst into flames and blew up was to have been used in a car bomb attack but went off prematurely. The driver was holding a detonator, and there were six tins of kerosene and two cooking gas canisters in the trunk, <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said. `` We believe it might be a terrorist act that failed because of the things we found in the car,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said the driver, identified only as a Palestinian from Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, has a criminal record for disturbing the peace. He was reported in serious condition in <LOCATION> Hadassah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Officials said the fire that preceded the blast apparently was caused by cooking gas leaking from the canisters in the trunk, but <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said the fire began in the gas tank. A witness said the blast occurred as the driver switched on the ignition. `` Exactly as he switched it the car exploded. It was n't a loud explosion. The whole car went up in flames,'' <PERSON> Aryeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapira </PERSON>, who was passing the area on his motorcycle, said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the center of the city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> was declared a closed military area after clashes between soldiers and stone-throwing Palestinians, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. Two Palestinians were wounded when soldiers opened fire on stone-throwers, the radio said. Arab reporters said Jewish settlers in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> shot a 14-year-old boy in the head. The victim, <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdia </PERSON>, was reported in serious condition at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, masked attackers shot 38-year-old <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samt </PERSON> in the head and in the mouth, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. He died later in <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. The reports said <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samt </PERSON> was accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. A Palestinian was wounded in a clash with soldiers in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, and seven residents of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> were shot and wounded in other confrontations with troops, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The violence broke out as Arabs in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> launched a three-day commercial strike to protest the death of a 16-year-old killed Wednesday in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Sabra </PERSON> quarter. The slain youth was a member of the underground of the Moslem fundamentalist movement <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, or `` Zeal,'' <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. At least 455 Palestinians have been reported killed in the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. Eighteeen Israelis have died. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said, meanwhile, that an army investigation of a deadly raid by troops in an Arab village April 13 showed that border patrol troops used `` exaggerated'' gunfire to quell <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> resistance. Five Palestinians were shot to death and at least 15 were wounded in what was one of the worst clashes of the uprising. The report on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Nahalin </LOCATION>, given to Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> on Thursday, showed the 25 paramilitary police fired 150 live bullets during the clash, the radio said.

 A minister has withdrawn a boycott threat against an insurance company because it has apologized for its role in sponsoring an award for an artist whose work includes a depiction of Christ submerged in urine. `` I have received a statement from <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>, apologizing for their part in this matter and it is a genuine apology,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> minister who heads the Tupelo-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> had threatened earlier this week to urge supporters to boycott the company for helping fund a $ 15,000 award to <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> in the Awards in the Visual Arts program. The award is funded by the <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a division of the insurance company, the <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the National Endowment for the arts. As winner of the award, the artist selects a work for a national tour. The 38-year-old <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> artist said he had selected his `` Piss Christ'' photograph for the tour because it best reflected his style. He uses fluids to affect photographic images. <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> said he had sought apologies from the sponsoring organizations. <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>, in a statement confirmed by his office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said his society was `` deeply upset by the pain that has been caused by the work by <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> that was included in the 1988 exhibit of the Awards in the Visual Arts program. `` As one of the sponsors of the program last year, <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> is very sorry to have had its name associated with an offensive piece of work,'' <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> wrote. `` Please be assured that you have our sincere apologies and our commitment to take every precaution against such a situation in the future.'' Although <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> said his association had not heard directly from the <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the organization's president, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldmark </PERSON>, said earlier in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that he respected `` the right of any individual to object to a work of art, and the parallel right of artists to express themselves and of exhibitors to show works that they deem interesting and meritorious artistically.'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Slye </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that the endowment is `` expressly forbidden in its authorizing legislation from interfering with the artistic choices made by its grantees.'' <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>, who described himself as religious, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Tuesday that when individuals such as <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> `` attack a work of art to such a great extent, they imbue it with a far greater power than when they ignore it and, in that, I'm flattered that they think it deserves such attention.''

 Thirty-two members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are asking <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s president-elect for action to halt the alleged persecution of churches by members of his right-wing political party and by the Salvadoran armed forces. The letter Thursday to President-elect <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> denounced the `` dramatic escalation of violence committed by factions from both the right and left'' over the past few weeks.'' But it singled out for attention recent `` verbal and physical attacks'' allegedly committed by members of <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s right-wing ARENA Party against Salvadoran church groups. The letter, drafted by Rep. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, D-Calif., and signed by him and 31 of his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> colleagues, said it is believed that violence against church groups is believed to be connected to their demands for a negotiated political solution to the war, their defense of human rights, their demand for an end to war-related aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and their efforts to relive the suffering of refugees and displaced people Citing a list of incidents since March 27, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members said a teacher in a Baptist school was assassinated, a Lutheran church worker was abducted, and the offices of church groups broken into and ransacked by officers of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> police. They also complained that ARENA Party members and troops of the Salvadoran armed forces have threatened the legal aid office of the Roman Catholic Church in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> for issuing a report `` which was critical of the rise of death-squad-related violence.'' `` We urge you to stop the persecution of the churches of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and the communities they serve,'' the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members told <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. `` We support action to end human rights violations and we look for a negotiated solution to the conflict within your country,'' they said.

 <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> said he is `` deeply disappointed and saddened'' by a lawsuit by longtime companion <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> who contends the tough-guy actor promised to support her for life but kicked her out. `` It will soon come to light that these accusations are unfounded and without merit. However, this matter will be dealt with in an appropriate legal arena,'' <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> said Thursday in a statement. Miss <PERSON> Locke </PERSON>, 41, sued Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seeking unspecified damages, title to two homes and an equal division of property acquired during the couple's 10-year relationship.

 Jurors in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial resumed deliberations today, the seventh day they have been considering 12 criminal charges against the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide in the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> North </PERSON> made a quick trip to <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> to speak Thursday night to an invitation-only audience at the <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and then returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to await his fate. The former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staffer spoke about traditional values and received a standing ovation from his audience, according to <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> members who heard his speech. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> sophomore from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> North </PERSON> spoke highly of the <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'s next scheduled guest _ former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ who will speak to the group in September. An anti-Contra group picketed outside the club before the speech. `` We do n't care whether <PERSON> North </PERSON> sees us or not,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, organizer for the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're demonstrating against the Bankers -LRB- Club -RRB- for giving him $ 25,000 while there are homeless people in this city sleeping on the streets. The <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> refused to say how much <PERSON> North </PERSON> was being paid for his speech. `` You're all a bunch of pro-communists'' shouted a well-dressed businessman at the demonstrators. `` I'm just a pedestrian,'' said the man as he took two flyers from a demonstrator and tore them into pieces. He declined to identify himself. There was no indication of whether jurors were nearing a verdict. There have been no notes from the jury since Monday, when a nurse was sent in to check a panel member's blood pressure. The nine women and three men were beginning their second week isolated from their families. They are shuttled back and forth between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courthouse and an area hotel by federal marshals. North has not been whiling away the time. He has made several other speeches since jury selection in his trial began on Jan. 31. He has been getting $ 25,000 an appearance through the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Speakers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. North, who has had at least three lawyers at the defense table and at times as many as five, faces legal bills estimated at $ 380,000 a month. North is accused of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cover up his role in secretly assisting the Nicaraguan Contras and lying to the attorney general about aspects of the diversion of funds to the Contras from the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales. He also faces charges that he accepted a $ 13,800 home security system and converted $ 4,300 in travelers checks from a <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader to his own use. Meanwhile, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> are supporting 10 news organizations in court to seek public disclosure of a stipulation in the case summarizing intelligence intercepts. The organizations, including The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, are appealing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s ruling that they can not see the document. It deals with the CIA-assisted shipment of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Hawk missiles from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in November 1985. North's lawyers used the document to defend him against the charge that he prepared a false chronology saying that no one in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government knew until January 1986 that Hawk missiles were aboard the flight.

<TEXT>
 Many Communist Party officials are unprepared or unwilling to accept the swift changes wrought by the political reforms of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the party newspaper Pravda said today. The editorial followed by one day the newspaper's publication of startling admissions of failure made by party officials at a meeting of the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. A senior Western diplomat today said the publication of the admissions may have been a device used by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to force the officials to more solidly back his program of political restructuring, known as perestroika. Pravda said political activity has rapidly increased over the past year and democratization is gaining ground. `` In many cases, however, party organizations and functionaries have proved unprepared for the rapid progress in extending democracy,'' the newspaper said. `` A number of party committees and local governing councils are lagging behind the times in their attitudes, styles, methods and interpretation of events.'' It said many officials were lapsing `` into old thinking, nostalgia for authoritarian leadership and panicky attempts to check grassroots initiatives under the pretext of protecting socialism.'' Pravda called on all party members, committees and organizations to follow the line of change initiated by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, regardless of current difficulties facing the economy and society. The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some of the 20 speakers at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting may have been taken by surprise when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> suggested their comments be published for the public to read. The speeches were sharply critical of the party. For example, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saikin </PERSON> said, `` The people feel uncomfortable, alarmed, have lost their optismism, and various generations of people, separate social levels and even regions are quarreling with themselves.'' As a result, said <PERSON> Saikin </PERSON>, who lost in the recent elections for the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, party organizations `` have lost their vanguard role.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in closing remarks at the meeting Tuesday, agreed perestroika was going poorly and was worsening shortages of housing, consumer goods and food. But, the 58-year-old leader said, people still have faith in the party. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gained strength to push for more extreme action at Tuesday's meeting when 74 of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s 301 members retired. Because of age, illness or political disgrace, those who stepped down had lost the top government or party job that entitled them to membership. The remarks of some of those who retired were published Thursday. Among them was <PERSON> Geidar </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON>, the 65-year-old former party chief in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and a close associate of former President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. News reports have accused <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON> of corruption and falsifying records to show he was a war veteran. But <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> the accusations were untrue and came from people he had fired in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> for wrongdoing. Approximately three dozen party officials lost their bids for seats in the 2,250-seat parliament, or <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melnikov </PERSON>, the party chief of the <LOCATION> Komi </LOCATION> region, told the committee that many officials are so afraid of the people's wrath that they are refusing to run in the next round of elections on May 14 `` We are losing the workers,'' he said. The country is `` in a real crisis'' that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is not fully aware of because the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> staff is `` safeguarding the general secretary from the severity of the situation.'' Because of the failures of perestroika, `` the authority of the party is falling in the eyes of the public,'' said <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Polozkov </PERSON>, a party leader in the <LOCATION> Krasnodar </LOCATION> region of southern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, who directed the first 38 episodes of the `` I Love Lucy'' television series, has died at age 77. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> died Sunday of congestive heart failure at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, three days before the death of <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, star of the landmark comedy series Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> died of a ruptured abdominal aorta Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> and cinematographer <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Freund </PERSON> pioneered the use of three cameras rather than one in filming `` I Love Lucy,'' one of the most popular shows in television history. The system, implemented at the urging of the late <PERSON> Desi </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON>, then Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s husband and co-star, allows a show to be filmed continuously and in sequence as though it were a stage play As a result, a show can be filmed in front of a live audience. The three-camera setup is still widely used. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> worked on such other hit shows as `` Gunsmoke,'' `` Bonanza,'' `` Star Trek,'' and `` <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>'s Heroes.'' He recalled in a 1977 interview that he left `` Lucy'' in 1952 after only one season to take another job that paid more. `` Maybe it was a stupid thing to do,'' he said. `` But then we did n't know we were creating history. `` We were just doing a show.'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> began his television career in 1948 as director of `` The Ford Theater,'' which established <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> as a serious dramatic network. During his career he was nominated for three Emmys and three Directors Guild of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> awards.

 Students chanting `` Yankee go home!'' fought police with firebombs and rocks today after authorities banned a march to the North Korean border, and striking workers rioted in two southern cities. Several thousand radical students clashed with riot police on at least five campuses in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> after the government banned a march to <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> border truce site 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> for talks with communist students. Twenty student delegates were seized by police as they tried to get to the border to meet the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> student delegates to discuss taking part in a youth festival in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> in July and other ways to reunite the two nations. About 6,000 striking workers clashed with riot police in the southeastern industrial cities of <LOCATION> Masan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION>, police said. Strikers in <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION> poured oil on some streets and set them ablaze and protesters in <LOCATION> Masan </LOCATION> pelted police with bits of scrap metal. It was the fifth day of clashes in <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION>. Riot police blocked 4,000 students trying to march out of <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Screaming students armed with metal and wood clubs attacked riot police with firebombs before troopers stormed onto the campus firing tear gas. Black police vans armed with multiple tear gas launchers fired hundreds of the bombs as fighting flared around the sprawling campus. It was surrounded by 3,000 riot police in green combat fatigues and visored helmets. Police officials said people were hurt, but they had no figures. Students clashed with riot police on at least four other <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> campuses. About 700 students battled troopers with firebombs and rocks for two hours at <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Student clashes also erupted in the southern port of <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> and radicals seized a government prosecutors' office in <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, the South Korean news agency. Student leaders lashed out at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in rallies before the clashes, accusing them of perpetuating the division of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. Speakers called for immediate unification with the communist north. `` Overthrow <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, who blocked our vital march to the north for talks with North Korean students. Let's raise a flag of anti-facism and anti-Americanism and march to <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>,'' a leader said at <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The government banned the march to <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> on grounds it posed a threat to public safety and the government alone has authority to deal with the rival north. Dissident leaders have said they will go ahead with planned anti-government protests this weekend, including plans for a major labor rally in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Sunday to mark the international May Day labor holiday. The government has banned all the demonstrations. The radical students and allied dissident groups lack popular support because of their extremism and are not seen as a threat to the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government. But government leaders are concerned about growing labor unrest and a wave of increasingly violent strikes for better pay and improved working conditions. Top opposition leaders Wednesday appealed to radical students and workers to halt protests and warned continued unrest could undermine democratic development in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Also today, 3,400 police officers offered their resignations to protest an alleged assault on a police superintendent by an opposition lawmaker. National Police Director <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Chong-suk </PERSON> said he ordered all the resignations returned, and government officials said his action would defuse the situation. It arose after legislator <PERSON> Sim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wan-koo </PERSON> reportedly slapped Superintendent <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon-young </PERSON> in the face during a labor protest Thursday in <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION>. Dissident leaders claim <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is a front for military rule. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> won elections in December 1987 after rival opposition candidates split the opposition vote.

<TEXT>
 The governing party forced the budget through the lower house of Parliament today over an opposition boycott, opening the way for Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to step down as promised because of a scandal. It was the first time since World War II that the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> bucked the Japanese tradition of consensus and used its majority to pass a budget despite a boycott. Chairwoman <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition group, said the move was `` an outrage ... and a serious challenge to the people.'' She demanded the government resign and let the opposition govern. `` We are determined to continue to fight until we win the dissolution of the Diet -LRB- parliament -RRB- and get new elections called,'' she said. The deputy speaker of the lower house, <PERSON> Shinnen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatagaya </PERSON>, said he would resign to protest the handling of the budget. An independent lawmaker, <PERSON> Yukio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoshima </PERSON>, told reporters he was quitting the upper house in a similar protest. Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> and the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Eiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagasue </PERSON>, said the government was trying to cover up the influence-peddling scandal. Nagasue accused the government of an `` unjustifiable debasement of parliamentary democracy.'' Opposition politicians blocked the hall outside the house chamber in an attempt to halt the vote, but guards pushed them aside to get Speaker <PERSON> Kenzaburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hara </PERSON> into the 512-seat chamber. After the 281-1 vote _ one independent cast a `` no'' ballot _ <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> bowed to the chamber, which was nearly a third empty. He promised on Tuesday that we would resign after the budget has been enacted. `` To be honest, I am feeling relief, but the budget still has to go through the upper house and I hope it will be passed quickly,'' he told reporters later. Asked if he intends to stay in office until the passage, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said, `` You can take it that way.'' Under the constitution, the $ 455 billion budget automatically takes effect May 27 if the less powerful upper house does not act on it. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said he would step down to take responsibility for a bribery and stock-profiteering scandal that has deeply shaken the public's trust in government. The scandal involving <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information and publishing conglomerate, has dominated Japanese politics since it surfaced in June. Prosecutors say Recruit sold unlisted stocks at bargain prices to about 160 political and business figures. The buyers profited handsomely when the stock went public, authorities say. The only remaining hurdle to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s resignation is selection of a successor. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> planned a weeklong visit to Southeast Asian countries beginning Saturday, and observers believe he will leave office shortly afterward. The apparent top choice of party leaders, former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, 75, has refused suggestions he take the job. He said again today the job is too heavy a burden for him because of his age and poor health. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> is known as `` Mr. Clean'' because of his humble political style. He suffers from diabetes, and government officials say his doctor has recommended he work no more than three hours a day. Earlier today, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> attended the funeral of <PERSON> Ihei </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>, his top aide and fund controller, who committed suicide Wednesday. <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> resigned last year after it was disclosed he had purchased bargain-priced stock from Recruit. This week, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> admitted Recruit loaned $ 384,000 to his campaign in <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>'s name.

<HEAD>Radiation from Soviet Satellite Reactors Blinding Scientific Instruments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Radiation from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear reactors powering spy satellites has been blinding scientific instruments aboard a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellite, according to reports published today The blinding and its source have been known since 1980, but the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government classified the data as secret until last August, scientists said in a series of five articles in Science magazine. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Solar Maximum Mission satellite was launched Feb. 14, 1980, to investigate, among other things, naturally occurring gamma rays in cosmic rays. Its instruments are being blinded, sometimes eight times a day, by gamma rays from the Soviet satellite reactors, the scientists said. The blinding means that much of the data sought by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellite could not be gathered. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has used nuclear reactors aboard more than 30 satellites since the 1960s to provide electricity to power radars surveying the oceans for movements of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other warships. To save weight, space satellites shield only their own equipment from the reactor. The earth's atmosphere prevents any radiation from reaching the ground. Much of the radiation in question is gamma rays. These are photons produced in nuclear fission more powerful by far than light rays or X-rays. Extremely energetic gamma rays also occur naturally in cosmic rays, through processes that astronomers do not yet understand, and in solar flares. Supernovae, quasars and neutron stars are thought to be sources. Though reactor-produced gamma rays interfered with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellite instruments, the main radiation affecting the satellite was electrons and positrons _ positively charged electrons _ from the reactor. These charged particles can be trapped for several minutes by the earth's magnetic field, and positrons colliding with ordinary matter in the astronomy satellite are annihilated to yield more gamma rays. `` The data storage capacity of -LRB- the satellite instrument -RRB- was saturated by such -LRB- positron-gamma ray -RRB- signals an average of eight times a day for much of 1987 and 1988, and it was effectively blinded for the rest of each orbit until the data could be transmitted to the ground,'' wrote <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Primack </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Particle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, in n overview article. A balloon-carried instrument over <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> in April 1988 launched by a team from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> was immune from the electron-positron radiation because of its low altitude, about 22 miles. `` The flux we detected from the nearest reactor exceeded by 50 times the flux expected from the strongest celestial sources,'' wrote the <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> team. The team estimated that it could detect such a reactor in an orbit as high as 1,500 miles. Satellites could turn off their instruments when passing through vulnerable zones, <PERSON> Primack </PERSON> wrote. `` But if many powerful reactors are in orbit, as contemplated for advanced stages of -LRB- Star Wars -RRB-, this approach would probably be inadequate to protect gamma-ray astronomy in low earth orbit,'' he said. Most of the Soviet satellites are in orbits only about 160 miles high, where traces of the atmosphere would make them fall to earth after a few months. The Soviet craft are boosted to permanent orbits nearly 900 miles high after a few months use. It was the failure of this boosting system that led to the crash of the <ORGANIZATION> Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> 954 satellite in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in 1978 and the 1983 crash of the Cosmos 1402 in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> in 1983. President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> proposed to ban reactors in space after the 1978 accident, but the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> refused. <PERSON> Primack </PERSON> suggested that now was a good time to renew the proposal.

 Students at universities in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> vowed today to continue a class boycott and campus wall posters proclaimed victory, a day after more than 150,000 students and supporters marched triumphantly for democracy. `` The strike must go on,'' read a new poster at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on the fifth day of the boycott. `` We must persist until final victory,'' read another at <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The government announced Thursday it was willing to talk with students about their demands for greater freedom. But student leaders rejected a stipulation that talks be conducted through official student groups. Protesters at most schools rejected the groups as non-democratic and formed their own unions, which the government says are illegal. Student leaders from several schools met today to discuss strategy. `` We talked about the march but did n't come to any decisions,'' one leader at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said on condition of anonymity. `` Right now we are savoring this victory. We have made the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> bend.'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, a student leader at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said they hoped the talks would be held soon and wanted to meet Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. `` He is the leader of the government, and he should hear all the views of the citizens,'' he said. Newspapers throughout <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> carried a <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> story saying only 30,000 students marched Thursday. But the 20-mile march through the streets of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> drew more than 150,000 students, workers and city residents calling for a free press and political reforms. It was communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest protest in modern times and lasted 15 hours. The march occurred after an editorial in the People's Daily called the student movement a `` chaotic disturbance'' and accused students of being unpatriotic. The unrest began after the death of ousted <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON> on April 15. The party fired him in 1987 for failing to crack down on pro-democracy demonstrations in late 1986. Protesters who led the march Thursday carried a poster saying: `` Uphold the righteous leaders of the party.'' Significantly, today's <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> report did not accuse the students of wanting the overthrow of the government. Most students say they only want the leaders to do their job better and respect human rights. Television today showed the first footage of the march. The report also repeated warnings the protest was illegal and organizers were breaking the law. The People's Daily, the official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, published an overview of the two weeks of protests, apparently to pacify students. The article denied students had been beaten in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last week when they staged a sit-in at the gates of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter saw police hit at least six students. The article also attempted to dispel a rumor that a female student had been killed. The woman, it said, was hit by a car as she returned from the protest. Many students believe police killed her, although it appeared the newspaper's account was correct. The country' most liberal newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, resumed publication today after the city government fired its chief editor, <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Benli </PERSON>, and installed in his place city propaganda official <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ji </PERSON>. Today's issue is an altered version of a withheld April 24 edition, which carried six pages honoring Hu. `` The items the government said were likely to cause disturbances have been taken out,'' one of the paper's editors said. During Thursday's march, tens of thousands of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents escorted students on bicycles and on foot, and tried to shield them from soldiers and police. `` We're opening a road for them,'' said one worker, after he helped push through a line of officers. Police had issued harsh warnings against marches, but the security forces were unarmed and they gave up after pushing matches failed to stop advancing demonstrators. Students say they plan another march May 4, the 70th anniversary of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first student movement for democracy. The movement grew out of students' opposition to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s territorial advances in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after World War I but developed into a quest for broader political goals, including democracy.

 Visiting Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has angered the government with his insistence that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat subsidies are not hurting <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, prompting one newspaper today to say: `` Read our lips Mr. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, Australians are not happy.'' Senior government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> was exasperated at <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s intransigence and that he became agitated and tense during their talks on Wednesday <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, at a news conference Thursday, bluntly refused to accept <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>'s assertion that <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> had a declining share of the world wheat market because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidies, known as the Export Enhancement Program. `` It is still my belief that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade policy is n't hurting <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, adding that the subsidies were directed against the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and `` not targeted at <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>.'' But <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> told reporters later: `` If a bullet hits you in the head, it hurts just as much if it was not aimed at you as if it was aimed.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> argued that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade subsidies were designed to counter <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> subsidies while <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said they affected <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s wheat sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> had suffered a `` very significant'' loss of exports to those countries. He cited a 91 percent loss in exports to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and a 21 percent loss in sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Overall, Australian wheat sales have fallen from an annual high of 18.6 million tons to 12.5 million tons since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidy program took effect. `` Now these sorts of things are not figments of our imagination. They are cold, hard and brutally hurtful economic statistics which have adversely affected our farmers, our wheat farmers,'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said. Trade Negotiations Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> was more direct, saying: `` If Mr. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, after a fulsome briefing by the prime minister, ca n't grasp the situation -LRB- then -RRB- there is little hope for him.'' The country's main nationally circulated newspaper, The Australian, said in its editorial today: `` Who do you think you are kidding, Mr. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>? Read our lips, Mr. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Australians are not happy.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> arrived Wednesday on the first leg of a four-nation tour of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and the Far East. He is visiting <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> through Sunday to attend celebrations marking the 47th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea. Officials said trade was the `` single most important'' issue that <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> had to raise with the vice president. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met for 90 minutes on Wednesday. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> is to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in June and the sources said he would raise trade issues in his talks with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has restored membership to dissident historian <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, whose writings about the personality cult of dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> prompted his expulsion in 1969, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said today. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> asked that the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> restore him as a member, and the request was approved, the official news agency said. It did not say when this occurred. In a telephone interview, the 63-year-old writer said he reacted `` positively'' to the news. Asked if his restoration was a result of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, he said: `` I did n't change my views A turnabout occurred in the party, the Central Committee. They stopped discriminating against me. I have been published here.'' He added that he never considered asking to be restored as a party member during the rule of President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> because, `` That was another epoch.'' <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> died in 1982. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said party officials asked him several months ago if he wanted to become a member again. `` They asked me how I would react, and I said I would not object.'' Like many Soviets who had fallen out of official favor, <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> has been restored gradually to good graces. He has appeared at several officially sponsored news conference and was elected April 9 as a deputy to the new Soviet parliament, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said it was <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>'s book `` Let History Judge,'' about <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s crimes, that prompted his expulsion from the party but that the control committee determined that action was `` unfounded'' and restored his membership. `` Let History Judge,'' which <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> started writing in 1962, was published first abroad, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1971. It did n't appear in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> until this year, when the literary journal <LOCATION> Znamya </LOCATION> published the first part of the book in January The entire book, an indictment of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s dictatorial rule, is scheduled to be put out by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s Progress Publishers. Under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness, it is no longer considered dissent to condemn <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> or report his crimes. In fact, the Soviet press is full of articles about <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s personality cult. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> has estimated that 40 million Soviets were either killed, arrested or otherwise repressed under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, and his figure _ along with his remarks about <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> _ has appeared in the Soviet press.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Leaving Namibia, U.N. Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said today that large numbers of guerrillas have left <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and returned to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> after clashes with South African-led troops that jeopardized a plan for the territory's independence. <PERSON> Cedric </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornberry </PERSON>, second-in-command of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring force in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, told reporters that `` substantial numbers'' of guerrillas had left northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since midday Wednesday. He gave no figures. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which has agreed to end its 74-year rule over <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, claimed that about 1,600 guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> crossed into the territory from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> beginning April 1. The resulting clashes with South African-led security forces resulted in the deaths of 305 guerrillas and 27 members of the security force, according to South African officials. Under a regional peace plan that provides for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence, the guerrillas were supposed to have remained at their bases in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> until mid-May, when they were to return unarmed Guerrilla leaders have denied violating the agreement and said some of their forces already were in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. To encourage the guerrillas' withdrawal, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has confined its forces in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to their bases for a 60-hour period that began Wednesday evening and is to end at daybreak Saturday. South African officials have made clear they want a full guerrilla withdrawal by the end of the period, although they have not disclosed what steps they would take if they believe guerrillas remain in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Guerrilla leaders, in a statement issued Thursday, said 1,337 guerrillas had `` redeployed'' from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The statement did not specify the period during which this withdrawal occurred, nor did it say how many guerrillas remained in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. If both <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s figures and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s estimate about the size of the incursion are accurate, there would be few, if any, guerrillas, still in the territory. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> said its guerrillas `` have been running the gantlet of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> troops' ambushes ... as well as a blockade along the <LOCATION> Namibia-Angola </LOCATION> border where <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has deployed a division of its troops to hunt down and kill them.'' The statement said all guerrillas in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> would soon move to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> as long as security forces `` do not impede their way.'' The independence plan is part of an agreement that also provides for withdrawal of South African and Cuban forces from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, Soviet, Angolan, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> and South African delegations met Thursday and today in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, to discuss the status of the accord. In <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, roving Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON> predicted today that the regional peace process would be back to normal within a month. <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON>, making the first official Soviet visit to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 33 years, said: `` I believe that we can make a step in the riht direction and at least we have succeeded in clarifying a number of very delicate points and overcome some difficulties, but still a lot is left.''

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> today urged <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies to seek a reduction in short-range nuclear missiles, despite strident <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British opposition. For the second day, the nation's leaders appeared on a nationally televised parliamentary session to outline their position, which has strained the alliance. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> have sided with <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> in the growing rift. Most of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s short-range missiles are based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> A government spokesman, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, said Dutch Premier <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> on Wednesday for talks with Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> in an apparent bid to resolve the dispute before a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit next month. The Dutch government has expressed support for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> position and has offered to mediate in the dispute. `` The West has no reason to be timid or to be concerned,'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said in his address. Rather, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said, Western nations should have the confidence to pursue a course that would include short-range missiles among the various arms already under discussion among the superpowers. `` We must courageously and decisively make use of the new openness the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is showing,'' said <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, a member of the detente-oriented, centrist <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` We must close that hole in the disarmament chain.'' Speaking of the West German demand for negotiations aimed at reducing the number of short-range missiles, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said: `` We can see that we are finding more and more understanding for this position within the whole alliance.'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> spoke after <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> and also emphasized that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> remains bound to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said it was `` totally unfounded'' to say that <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s government could accept a loosening of ties between <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and its Western allies <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on Thursday made a speech before parliament in which he reaffirmed his call for talks with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> over the short-range missiles. Such talks are strongly opposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which fear the negotiations could lead to the removal of short-range weapons and leave <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> dangerously exposed to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's superior conventional forces. Public opinion polls indicate a large majority of West Germans are opposed to the modernization of the weapons. The issue is causing a division among <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies before the May 29-30 summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, where the Western alliance hopes to reach a common position on the missiles. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Sunday, when the two are expected to discuss the issue. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has strongly criticized <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s proposal for talks with the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has launched a diplomatic offensive against <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s proposal, instructing its ambassadors in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries to present arguments against starting up negotiations on short-range weapons. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s government has been losing support among voters and the call for talks is designed to improve its standing before next year's federal elections. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> also has called on the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to delay a decision on replacing the aging short-range <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> nuclear missiles until after federal elections next year. Recent polls indicate that three-quarters of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> population favors eliminating nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 A bitter 18-month effort by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> to organize the <ORGANIZATION> Mack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> assembly plant ended with 53 percent of the employees voting to accept union representation. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Trucks </PERSON> said it would contest Thursday's election, which the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> won with 453 votes to 398 for the company. An employee group, which offered to represent workers, received two votes. `` It is totally on hold until it is settled,'' company spokeswoman <PERSON> Deb </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolley </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> is not finished fighting this battle.

The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> urged <ORGANIZATION> Mack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucks </ORGANIZATION> president and chief executive officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON> to accept the election results. `` The present opportunity to change direction should not be ignored,'' the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> said in a letter to <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON>. `` The alternative is further unnecessary damage to the UAW-Mack relationship.'' Observers predicted the outcome of the election could affect the way business is conducted in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, which historically has ranked among the least unionized states. Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> moved quickly to assure business owners and workers that `` right-to-work'' labor laws will not change in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` Those who desire to join a union are free to do so. Those who do not desire to join a union are equally free not to do so,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> organizer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said employees who do not join the union will be treated the same as those who do. `` In a right-to-work state, we have a right to defend the people,'' he said. `` They have the right to join the union.'' `` We worked hard and we prayed,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Casstevens </PERSON>, international secretary and treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>, told employees at a victory celebration Thursday night over the vote at the 1 -LCB- - year-old plant `` We're bringing in democracy into this plant and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a 44-year-old union organizer who has worked for <ORGANIZATION> Mack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucks </ORGANIZATION> for 17 years, said he was `` ecstatic, but not surprised'' at the election results. And <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Drabick </PERSON>, a worker in the plant, said he does not foresee any problems with having the union. `` We're still a team. We all stick together. We have one goal and that is to build trucks,'' <PERSON> Drabick </PERSON> said. `` I'm happy, I'm glad we got it.'' <PERSON> Chick </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrocks </PERSON>, a unit manager for <ORGANIZATION> Mack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucks </ORGANIZATION>, said he was disappointed with the election results. `` The employees do n't realize what they got into,'' he said The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 1,800 Mack employees in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, began its drive in 1987 to represent employees at the <LOCATION> Winnsboro </LOCATION> plant. The plant opened after <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> closed its main assembly plant in <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, in 1986. Under an agreement between the company and the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>, nearly 300 employees were transferred to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> plant. Those employees each have received $ 100 weekly from the union to defray moving expenses and lower wages. Employees at the <LOCATION> Winnsboro </LOCATION> plant will earn $ 10 per hour by the end of the summer. Workers at the other three union-represented Mack facilities make about $ 14.50 an hour.

The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Kichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tazawa </PERSON>, told reporters today he hopes to reach agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> leaves office. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s announcement Tuesday that he will resign soon because of a stock and bribery scandal brought new uncertainty to already troubled plans for the FSX, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s equipment bureau returned Thursday from talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and his agency consulted today with the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, and the prime minister's office to work out a unified policy. The FSX project has been criticized by some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen who charge it is a giveaway of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology that Japanese companies could use to compete with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aviation industry. Supporters say the project is a way to add fighters to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s inventory in strategic northeast <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s expense It also would provide jobs for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and give <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> access to sophisticated radar technology developed by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, they say. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration says it wants clarification of a joint production agreement reached last year. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> reportedly demanded 50 percent of engine production work in exchange for giving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a 40 percent share of the production work for the entire aircraft. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reportedly wants assurances any new technology developed from the project will be available to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, along with protection for U.S.-developed computer codes that help fly and control the plane.

<HEAD>TWA Jumbo Jet Lost Part of Wing Slat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 flying from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> with more than 200 people on board lost part of a wing slat as it prepared to land at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the airline said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> said officers from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> have launched an inquiry into the April 20 incident, which a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman called a `` minor accident.'' Aviation experts said the loss of a slat may affect low speed handling and might mean an aircraft having to land at a faster speed. The leading edge slats are six feet long and positioned along the front of each wing to increase lift. They are operated hydraulically to change the air flow over the wing and allow the aircraft to land at a slower speed. A <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said a two-foot piece of the slat between the fuselage and the No. 3 engine on the right wing fell off after a bolt sheared. The shearing forced up the flap, breaking off a section of it, the spokesman said. However, he said the damage did not cause any problems with the handling of the aircraft and denied there had been any emergency. `` It did not affect the aerodynamics of the aircraft and the plane made a perfectly safe landing. The pilot would probably not have been aware that anything was wrong until he had landed ... it was a perfectly routine landing,'' he said. The spokesman said the piece that fell off would have weighed about four pounds. He said authorities were notified when the piece was discovered missing. It has not been found, he said. `` It is impossible to say exactly where it was lost because the crew felt no bump or anything like that. It would have been when the aircraft was on approach because the slats are only used when the plane is coming in to land,'' he said. The aircraft was taken to the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> maintenance base for repairs. The <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said that he did not know the age of the aircraft or the exact number of passengers on Flight 760.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> arrived in this island nation today where a `` papal truce'' was delcared to silence anti-government protests that have claimed six lives. The pope knelt and kissed the ground after being greeted by President <PERSON> Didier </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON>. The Archibishop of <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Razafimahatratra </PERSON>, joined the president in welcoming the pope. The pope and <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON> were to meet privately at the presidential palace. <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> is the first stop on <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s fifth African tour. The nine-day trip also will take him to the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island of Reunion, and to <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>. It is the 41st foreign pilgrimage of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s 10 -LCB- - year papacy. In all, the pope will deliver 36 speeches and travel 13,500 miles during his trip. He is scheduled to return to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on May 6. <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is the continent where Roman Catholicism is experiencing its fastest growth. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> counts 75 million followers in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, about 13 percent of the population, and projects the figure will surpass 100 million by the year 2000. <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> also is plagued by social and economic problems, and <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials said the pope is expected to address such issues as AIDS, human rights and apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The pope's arrival in <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, a huge island off <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s southeast coast, comes on the heels of a series of violent protests against the government of President <PERSON> Didier </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON> At least six people have been killed and 74 wounded in street battles since last week. The demonstrations were organized by opposition leaders who charged that last month's presidential election was rigged. <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON>, who took power in 1975, was re-elected for a third, seven-year term. The government said <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON> received about 63 percent of the vote. A commission set up by a federation of church groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said there were many voting irregularities. An alliance of opposition leaders announced Tuesday it would suspend demonstrations during the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s visit, saying it recognized the work of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and the church `` in favor of democracy and the defense of the rights of man.'' The opposition leaders said they would renew strikes and demonstrations after May 1 to press their demands for formation of a transitional government to hold new elections. About 22 percent of <PERSON> Madagsacar </PERSON>'s 11 million people are <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, and the church has often spoken out against <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON>'s government. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> was expected to emphasize the need for respect of human rights in <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>. With the country in a deep economic crisis, <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON> has abandoned some of his socialist policies and turned to Western governments and international agencies for help. The island's exotic plant and wildlife also is endangered by mass destruction of its forests Over the next three days in <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, the pope is to celebrate Mass in <LOCATION> Antisaranana </LOCATION> on the northern tip of the island and <LOCATION> Fianarantsoa </LOCATION> in the south. In Reunion, a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> overseas territory, the pope will meet with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> and beatify a 19th century <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school teacher who helped abolish slavery on the island. In a papal first, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> will fly on the Concorde, but the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> jetliner that will take him to <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> will not travel at supersonic speed because of the shortness of the trip. In <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> is expected to speak about apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the system of racial segregation which the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> recently denounced as the most systematic form of racism in the world. In <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, the pope may raise the issue of AIDS, which has afflicted some 20 percent of the male population, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials said.

 A man who kept hospital workers at bay with a gun while tearfully removing his comatose son from life support systems and letting him die dramatized an ethical `` issue waiting to happen,'' a law professor says. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, 23, is charged with first-degree murder and on Thursday was ordered to undergo a psychiatric examination by a judge who called his case `` an extraordinary situation surrounded by extraordinary circumstances.'' `` I want to know if he is any danger to himself or anyone else,'' said Cook County Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bastone </PERSON>, before setting another hearing for May 18. <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, free on $ 75,000 personal recognizance bond, refused to talk to reporters. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, who told police, `` I did it because I love my son,'' will plead innocent. <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> met briefly with prosecutors today in the chambers of Chief Criminal Court Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> and worked out an agreement to delay until May 3 the appearance dates for those subpoenaed, said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Partee </PERSON> Ms. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> would not comment further because of the confidentiality surrounding grand jury proceedings. But a law-enforcement source with knowledge of the case said <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>' wife and several other family members had received subpoenas to appear before the grand jury, possibly as early as today <PERSON> Partee </PERSON> on Thursday confirmed his intention to prosecute <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, but suggested there could be `` a compassionate kind of justice.'' <PERSON> Partee </PERSON> said he could understand the emotions that a parent feels at seeing the suffering of an incurably ill child. `` But we must be reasonable and say, I think, that under no circumstances does any person have the right to take the life of another,'' he said during the Thursday taping of a radio show to be aired Sunday. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> law professor and fellow at the school's <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION>, said that charging <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> with murder was wrong and called the case an `` issue waiting to happen.'' `` Doctors have an exaggerated sense of the sacred nature of life,'' <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> said. `` It seems to me he should have been able to write a letter to the hospital saying, ` Please turn off the respirator. Very truly yours.''' Other ethicists also expressed sympathy for the father of two other children, who along with his wife had asked months ago for life support to be withdrawn from their 16-month old son, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>. The parents had been refused. The boy had been unconscious and not expected to recover since August, when he swallowed a balloon at a birthday party, said his physician, Dr. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, director of pediatric intensive care at Rush-Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where Wednesday's incident occurred <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said, `` I was personally and professionally sympathetic'' with the <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>' request to withdraw life support, but `` I did n't believe there was a legal option to allow me to act on the basis of their request.'' <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, legal counsel for the hospital, said that because of <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' child-abuse laws, the only way the institution could have complied would have been if <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> had been determined totally brain-dead or his heart and lungs had stopped functioning. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I have sympathy for this father, because it seems to me he felt he had no choice but to act on what he felt was best for this child at the point of a gun. `` I still think he should be prosecuted. I do n't think you can use weapons to direct medical treatment,'' <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` But I have sympathy because I think society has not made it possible for parents to be heard about when medical treatment should be stopped _ when it is futile _ for very young children,'' <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> said. Police said <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> entered the hospital intensive care unit at about 1 a.m. Wednesday and unhooked the respirator of his son while holding hospital workers off with a .357 - caliber Magnum <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, a house painter in <LOCATION> Cicero </LOCATION>, surrendered the gun as soon as he was sure the boy was dead, authorities said. His wife, <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON>, was out of the room at the time. Authorities said <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> also disconnected the respirator in December, but it was quickly replaced and he was not charged because the hospital did not call police.

 An Iraqi soldier shot down an Egyptian jet fighter by mistake as it prepared to land in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> for an air show, and there were several casualties as the plane crashed in pieces, Arab diplomats said today. The diplomats, speaking by telephone from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital, said the incident occurred April 20. The plane, an Egyptian-built version of the Alpha fighter-bomber produced by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, apparently was hit by a Soviet-designed, shoulder-fired SAM-7 missile. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a man on the ground was killed when the plane fell to the ground, hurling debris over a wide area.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he `` learned a lot'' from his just-completed six-state tour, designed to enhance his activist image 100 days into his tenure, and took a slap at unflattering reporting of the trip. `` In terms of problem-solving, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ... does not automatically know best,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a gathering of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a business-oriented group of state legislators. Apparently referring to news accounts that described his trip as themeless, disoriented and jumbled, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` It's a very important thing for a president to get outside the White House and move around this country. Some of the friends that we were traveling with did n't seem to understand that. But I can tell you that I learned a lot from it. And it was a very good thing to do and I'm going to keep doing it.'' The trip was timed to project <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as an active problem-solver just as the media assess his first 100 days of his presidency, a White House aide said Thursday. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he is indifferent to the milestone, `` he's making these appearances even before some of these 100-day stories are getting out,'' said the official. He discussed the strategy on grounds of anonymity. Other White House aides called the trip a success, despite an aura of confusion caused by scheduling foul-ups and unfocused presidential speeches. `` Sometimes just the idea of getting out of ... <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is part of the president's responsibility and role,'' chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said Thursday. `` He really feels it's important for him to go out and let the folks see him. The president gets a lot out of it.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> conceded that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speeches on several occasions garnered little coverage on the heavily watched national television evening news shows. But he said `` you do n't always focus just on trying to get 15 seconds or 30 seconds on the national news. The regional aspect is very critical.'' White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> denied that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip lacked any overriding theme the nation could focus on, saying that `` the theme is building a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began the trip Monday by attending a memorial service in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, for the 47 victims of the USS Iowa explosion. this was added to an already-heavy schedule Monday that had <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declaring himself off to `` a good start'' in a speech to <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> newspaper publishers in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The trip took <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` He wanted to get to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to talk about some of the major issues,'' such as research and development for high technology and a reduction in the capital gains tax. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dropped plans to talk about offshore oil drilling because of the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> oil spill, aides said privately. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been especially determined to hit hard on the administration's campaign to attack drug abuse. `` Most Americans feel it's a critical issue,'' the chief of staff said, `` and he wants to make sure he can do what he can to help coordinate.'' As part of that attempt, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visited a 213-acre ranch in the <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> hillside that had been turned into a sophisticated drug-trafficking clearinghouse, replete with hidden chutes and trap doors to conceal the merchandise. On Thursday, before flying home to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he sat at one of a dozen multi-screen consoles at a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> drug-interdiction communications center in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and watched a simulated drug bust in which narcotics-running boats and planes were tracked and apprehended. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has sought to minimize the significance of reaching the 100-day threshold, which will arrive Sunday, saying he succeeded a man he served for eight years as vice president and that he never intended substantial changes in the first months of his presidency. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said the next 100 days will see <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> heavily involved in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> and the seven-nation economic summit in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in July. Also, he said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will focus heavily on trying to push ahead with a more lasting budget-deficit agreement and will work to see through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> his proposals to save the beleaguered savings and loan industry. The president also likely will spend time defending an expected veto of legislation that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is expected to pass, raising the minimum wage from the current $ 3.35-an-hour rate to $ 4.65. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> believes the rate should be no higher than $ 4.25. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> acknowledged that a package of crime legislation to assist in the drug-crusade is not yet ready for announcement by the White House or introduction in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

 Five people, including a child, were slain in one of the bloodiest nights on record in the Danish capital, national TV reported Friday. Police believe a 27-year-old man went on a rampage and killed three women and a young girl before he committed suicide in a rented car. One of the women and the little girl were found murdered in the man's apartment Friday morning. Police said they had a `` family relationship'' with the man. Police also discovered the body of a 30-year-old woman who was shot to death in her home while her family slept in another part of the house. Around the same time, a woman in her 20s was found stabbed to death in an apartment after neighbors called police about a disturbance. Police later found the man in a car parked nearby, and they said he had shot himself. Police also connected the man with two attempted murders Thursday. In the fifth, unrelated slaying, an elderly man was stabbed to death in his apartment. A 20-year-old prostitute was arrested in the slaying. No identities were released.

 Pow! Bam! Zap! Thud! So goes `` Starmites,'' the futuristic comic book musical that arrived Thursday at Broadway's Criterion Center. The show purports to be a salute to the fabled sci-fi superheroes of <ORGANIZATION> DC </ORGANIZATION> and Marvel comics. Instead, it trashes them, trampling on their sense of fun, style and most of all, adventure. Do n't look for the exuberance <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> captured on film more than a decade ago in `` Star Wars,'' or the innocent dumb fun of the mid-1950s `` Superman'' television series starring <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON>. They are missing here. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, who wrote the music and lyrics for `` Starmites,'' and <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> who, along with <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, concocted the book, ca n't settle on the right tone for their meager story It vacillates between high camp and sappy, juvenile comedy. The tale concerns a young girl, <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON>, who lives in her own fantasy world of comic books. She's pulled into Inner Space, Earth's parallel dimension, and a meeting with the Starmites who are sort of an intergalactic version of the Guardian Angels. These good guys are led by <PERSON> Spacepunk </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> who bears an uncanny resemblance to `` Star Wars'' hero <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. Green acts with the same breezy and appealing nonchalance and has a good voice, too. <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> is played by <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> whose show business savvy and brash, belting style of selling a song are at odds with her supposedly waif-like character. They end up meeting Trinkulus, a lizard-like creature who sings what sounds like off-key, soft-rock madrigals, and Diva, the tough, brassy leader of the Banshees. As played by <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> McNight </PERSON>, Diva resembles the late drag artist Divine, only her crew cut is a little more punkish. Miss <PERSON> McNight </PERSON> certainly can put over a number. Her `` Hard to Be Diva'' pretty much stops the show, although it was n't going much of anywhere. The villain of the piece, a steel-plated warrior called <PERSON> Shak </PERSON> <PERSON> Graa </PERSON>, looks like a tin-can version of <PERSON> Darth </PERSON> <PERSON> Vader </PERSON> and sounds like the Phantom of the Opera with a head cold. The minimal plot includes a feeble love triangle involving <PERSON> Spacepunk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> and Diva's daughter, <PERSON> Bizarbara </PERSON>, also played by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON>. You may not care who wins out, but true love does triumph in the end. At least director <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> gets the actors through the dialogue quickly and choreographer <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Assaf </PERSON> has experly drilled the cast. But it's hard to judge their expertise when they are forced to jump around on stage to something called `` The Dance of Spousal Arousal.'' The production's special effects are negligible. Set designer <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Detweiler </PERSON> has provided a nice backdrop of twinkly stars but the rest of his designs, including a giant bird that unfolds its wings to reveal a throne, are suprisingly tacky. The costumes are worse, especially for the women. Diva and her quartet of leather-clad ladies-in-waiting are dressed by designer <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirschfeld </PERSON> to look like extras out of `` <LOCATION> Ilsa </LOCATION>, the She-Wolf of the SS.'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s score slips from memory as soon as it's heard. It's cartoonish in the worst sense, crude and obvious The music and lyrics have none of the wit and sophistication that <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Strouse </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> displayed in `` It's a Bird! It's a Plane! It's Superman! -LRB- one of the theater's most unjustly neglected scores -RRB-, or the Broadway professionalism that <PERSON> Strouse </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Charnin </PERSON> managed to pack into `` Annie.'' `` Starmites'' is the first production at the Criterion Center Stage Right, one part of a new theater complex in Times Square. Its other theater, a cabaret space, housed `` Suds,'' a lamentable celebration of Golden Oldies, last fall. What `` Suds'' did to those hits of the 1950s and'60s, `` Starmites'' does to the comics. Where's `` Little Lulu'' now that we really need her? What other critics said: <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> wrote, `` The trouble with it _ even before the music and lyrics _ is the idea. It is a foolish idea for a musical. And nothing in the theater can redeem folly except a circus. And this is no circus.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said, `` In the last few years a whole new genre has emerged, musicals that have no intrinsic merit but are suitable for leaving the kids while you go shopping. `` In this genre, you have ` Cats,' ` <ORGANIZATION> Starlight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>' and now ` Starmites.' In this genre, you do n't judge a musical by its content but rather by its visuals. Will they live up to the expectations of kids suckled on MTV? Here ` Starmites' is a sort of trailblazer. ... the style of the show is Tacky High-Tech, surely a new category with loads of potential.'' <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gussow </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> wrote, `` To its credit, ` Starmites' never takes itself too seriously and is always tongue in cheek. It remains a light-hearted space flight.''

 A runaway `` greenhouse effect'' has eliminated any trace of water. Volcanoes number not in the hundreds or thousands, but the hundreds of thousands. Its crushing atmospheric pressure, suffice it to say, could never support anything resembling human life. <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> is not exactly <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. For eight months beginning in August 1990, the space probe <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> will circle the second planet from the Sun, using computer-enhanced radar images to study a planet so inhospitable that its 900-degree surface temperature would melt lead. Yet, for all its alien qualities, scientists think the Magellan mission will yield valuable information about the formation of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. `` The most likely scenario is that we'll find something that will completely astound and baffle us,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. The craft was being ferried into space aboard the shuttle Atlantis, to be launched from Earth orbit on its 15-month trajectory to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. Pictures from <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> should help scientists deduce `` the probability you're going to find Earth-like planets _ and life _ somewhere else,'' said geologist <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Soderblom </PERSON>, a scientist working on the Magellan project. Peering through acid-laden clouds, <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> should give scientists their best look yet at a planet so outwardly different from the garden of Earth yet apparently shaped by the same geologic processes. `` Of all the planets in the solar system, <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> is most like our own Earth in size, mass and distance from the sun,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> says. Among the common forces, scientists say, are volcanic eruptions, meteorite impacts and, perhaps, continental drift, the evolutionary movement of huge land masses. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> will also look for evidence of wind and water erosion and test the bounds of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>' gravity. The image of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> formed by pictures taken from earlier <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet space probes is of a planet where molten rock lies so close to the solid crust surface that impacting meteorites might produce volcanic eruptions, where hundreds of thousands of volcanoes stretch for thousands of miles across <LOCATION> lowland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> plains </LOCATION>, where continent-sized highlands sprout mountains dwarfing Everest. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>, once it begins orbiting <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> on Aug. 10, 1990, will look for ancient stream channels, shorelines and other evidence the planet once may have had oceans. Scientists believe an unchecked `` greenhouse effect'' _ in which the carbon dioxide atmosphere acted like greenhouse glass and trapped solar heat _ raised the temperature until water disappeared. It's a $ 550-million project with the scientific world watching. `` Part of the answer is knowing whether <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> is a fluke or just one of the natural consequences of the evolution of a generic solar system,'' said <PERSON> Soderblom </PERSON>, who works for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. Scientists will probe the gravity forces of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> by plotting the path of <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> as it swoops to within 155 miles of the planet's surface and then sweeps out to a high orbit point of 4,977 miles In looking for similarities between <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, scientists begin by noting that they are roughly the same size, weight and distance from the Sun, and are both bigger than Earth's moon, Mercury and Mars. Heavenly bodies `` are a lot like potatoes. The big ones stay hot for a long time, and the little ones cool off quickly,'' said <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, himself a geologist. The moon, Mercury and <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> have cold surfaces free of continental drift. Because a planet's internal heat `` drives the geological machinery,'' however, scientists believe <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and Earth both give off heat through volcanic activity and movements of gargantuan pieces of rock along the planetary crust, <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> should help scientists learn if any of the Venusian volcanoes are still erupting and how crustal rock movements differs from that on Earth. Rock in <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s crust is created and recycled in a conveyor-belt manner. Hot crustal rock is born along midocean ridges _ undersea mountain chains thousands of miles long. New crust is pushed away from these ridges as more rock emerges. The crust eventually collides with lighter continental rock, such as at the `` subduction zone'' where <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> seafloor rock sinks beneath <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. Heat is released as sinking rock melts, creating volcanoes. Earth releases most of its heat at midocean ridges and subduction zones. <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaber </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> geologist, believe <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> loses its internal heat mostly through `` hot spot'' volcanoes. On <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, such volcanoes form where molten rock rises through thin parts of the crust, such as in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. But there's evidence that <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> has crustal movement similar to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and that the volcanic ranges may be the <LOCATION> Venusian </LOCATION> equivalent of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s midocean ridges. No one yet has found conclusive evidence of subduction zones on <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. In places, however, folded mountains and valleys are squeezed up against <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>' continent-like highlands, Aphrodite and Ishtar, the latter of which has mountains taller than <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION>. These regions look something like <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s Himalayas, mountains formed when <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> smashed into <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. So crustal movements on <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> may be `` thin-skinned,'' forming folded mountains without large chunks of crustal rock diving deep into the planet, <PERSON> Schaber </PERSON> said. If large plates of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>' crustal rock are in motion, `` you can bet there's Venusquakes,'' he added.

 More than three-quarters of people trying to quit smoking were able to do so with the help of nicotine patches in a study at the <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, researchers reported today. In a six-week study that started last fall, 77 percent of the people who wore nicotine patches had stopped smoking, said Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Mayo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Smoking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cessation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and one of the investigators. The silver-dollar-sized patches slowly release nicotine through the skin to the bloodstream. A control group in the study wore patches not treated with nicotine, and only 39 percent of them quit smoking. `` There were remarkable differences between the two groups,'' Hurt said. While cautioning that a long-term follow-up study is needed, <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> said the patch could be a `` remarkable advancement'' as a tool for helping people stop smoking. The patch, similar to those used for dispensing some kinds of medicine, contains 30 milligrams of nicotine. About 1 milligram of nicotine is absorbed through the skin every hour so smokers are better able to cope with the withdrawal symptoms associated with quitting smoking. The Mayo Clinic is one of four centers studying the patch for possible <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> approval. Results of <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON>'s study of 62 people were the first to be reported, and were to be released today during a national conference of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> and Other Drug Dependencies in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Other studies have shown an 8 percent quitting rate over a one-year period among people who use such methods as physician's advice, nicotine gum and self-help programs to try to quit smoking The one-year quitting rate has been about 25 percent to 30 percent among those who participate in a formal smoking cessation program. The patch was developed by <ORGANIZATION> Elan </ORGANIZATION> pharmaceutical company in <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. Hurt said researchers are not sure how long it may take before the nicotine patch, if it proves successful, will be available for commercial use

 A four-lane bridge on a major city thoroughfare was closed after inspectors discovered one of its footings had eroded, transportation officials said. Authorities closed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 51 bridge over the <LOCATION> Wolf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in north <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> on Thursday night, said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Renner </PERSON>, spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON>. The closure, ordered by state <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, was temporary, pending a full inspection, <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> said. Inspectors, engineers and divers were expected to determine Friday if the bridge could be reopened or should remain closed until the problems are corrected, <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> said. The decision comes in the wake of a mass inspection following two fatal bridge collapses in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> this month. `` We've had crews of inspectors out over the last several weeks inspecting well over a hundred bridges in west <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> looking for any additional erosion problems,'' <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> said. Inspectors looking at the <LOCATION> Wolf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> bridge discovered `` considerable scouring'' on one end of one of the span's footings, he said. Eight people died when a two-lane span of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 51 collapsed into the <LOCATION> Hatchie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Covington </LOCATION> on April 1.

 <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaham </PERSON> was at his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> high school reciting <PERSON> Chaucer </PERSON> when he received a summons that seemed straight out of the storybooks. Israeli violin virtuoso <PERSON> Itzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> had an ear infection and could n't perform at two <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> concerts, and <PERSON> Shaham </PERSON> was asked to stand in on two days' notice. The first of the concerts ended Thursday night with cheers and flowers for the 18-year-old violinist after his performance of the difficult Violin Concerto No. 1 by <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruch </PERSON>. `` This is something I've never had before,'' said <PERSON> Shaham </PERSON>, perspiring in his dressing room at the Royal Festival Hall afterward, as he stared at the basket of flowers. <PERSON> Shaham </PERSON>, from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, was reciting the prologue from <PERSON> Chaucer </PERSON>'s `` The Canterbury Ttales'' in an English examination at <ORGANIZATION> Horace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday when he was called out and asked to fly to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> next day <PERSON> Shaham </PERSON> promptly took three days off school. <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, his <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> agent, said telephone consultations with <PERSON> Shaham </PERSON>'s general manager in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and conductor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilson-Thomas </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> decided on the <PERSON> Bruch </PERSON> concerto, followed by <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Sibelius </PERSON>' Violin Concerto on Friday. Asked how well he knew the works, the tall, chubby-faced musician grinned and said: `` I was nervous because I felt I could not fill in for <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON>. I last played the <PERSON> Bruch </PERSON> in December and the <PERSON> Sibelius </PERSON> in the summer.'' `` But the funny thing is,'' he added, `` I had some bizarre premonition about this. On Monday, I changed the strings on my Guadagnini -LRB- violin -RRB-, which I always do before a concert, although I was n't booked for any concert this week.'' `` I'm always nervous when he plays but I was n't tonight,'' said his astrophysicist father, <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaham </PERSON>. `` I knew that nothing could go wrong.'' `` I did n't know that,'' his son chimed in. `` But with an orchestra like that and Tilson-Thomas I felt completely comfortable.'' <PERSON> Shaham </PERSON> said he began playing violin when he was seven and wants to be a professional. He said he had never been so rushed before. `` I once had to stand in for <PERSON> Yehudi </PERSON> <PERSON> Menuhin </PERSON> who had flu in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` But I had a week's notice of that.'' <PERSON> Shaham </PERSON> is practically unknown in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> although he was here once before in debut with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Symphony in May 1987 and again in March 1988. Concertgoers Nicola Constable and <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> of The Strad, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> music magazine, praised <PERSON> Shaham </PERSON>'s performance. `` I thought he was brilliant.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has accused the Panamanian government of setting up `` systematic fraud'' for an upcoming election, but that country's foreign minister today accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of interfering in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s electoral process. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would `` not recognize fraudulent election results engineered by -LRB- Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a statement released during his visit Thursday to <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` In recent weeks, the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime has taken steps to commit systematic fraud,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, told the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> today, `` American plans to interfere in the Panamanian electoral process have entered a phase of direct participation by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with the goal of disturbing the public order and propagating chaos, prompting general destabilization in the country around the time of the elections to create an excuse for military intervention.'' Ousted Panamanian President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> met Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to discuss the May 7 balloting. He told reporters that opposition parties in his country did not receive any covert aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and branded such reports as a cover-up by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` I believe <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has looked for an excuse to take away from the people's attention what is going on in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> said in response to a question. Reports published last week in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had signed a secret intelligence directive, called a `` finding,'' to provide $ 10 million to the general's opponents in the presidential elections. The White House has said it will not comment on intelligence matters. Earlier Thursday, the acting <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, called those reports of covert aid the centerpiece of a misinformation campaign by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` There is absolutely no truth to that,'' <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said. `` The opposition has run a meager campaign because they have no money.'' <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> are exiles who still are recognized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as legitimate leaders. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ousted <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> in February 1988 after the president called for the general's ouster. The move came a few weeks after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. `` As long as Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> remains in power there can not be and will not be any improvement in relations with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, repeating the official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stance taken since shortly after the drug indictment. The secretary of state also said former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidents <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> would be among a group of international observers for the May 7 presidential elections. `` It will be interesting if he refuses to admit them as observers,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. The May 7 elections pits <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, against <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, running on an anti-government coalition ticket. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been forecasting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will rig the elections, issuing statements claiming the Panamanian leaders manipulated voter lists and intimidated opposition figures. `` Up till now Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has not shown any reason to believe they -LRB- the elections -RRB- will be fair and free,'' <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> said after the meeting with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, which ended with them both being trapped briefly in a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> elevator. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said earlier the observers should watch the setting up of the polls, the actual balloting and the counting. The acting Panamanian ambassador said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was attempting to steal the elections. He said recent <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> maneuvers included the detention of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist, mandatory visas `` to keep people away,'' and limited access by the opposition to the media. Newsweek reporter <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> was detained Wednesday for several hours by the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> for allegedly possessing a dollar bill bearing anti-Noriega slogans. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> called it `` a typical instance of an absence of political freedom and basic civil liberties in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said the Panamanian regime's appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> today to `` denounce aggression by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' was to `` deviate from the real issue: the country is held hostage by a dictator.'' The internal problems in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> broke out in June 1987 when a former military officer linked <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to drug trafficking, money laundering and election fraud. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut off economic and military aid in 1987. Sanctions were imposed last year, shortly after the indictment in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.

 An investigation into a $ 225 million federal housing program shows it was used during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years `` to feather the financial nest'' of former administration officials and other prominent Republicans, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman says. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said he will hold hearings on the report by the inspector general of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which suggested favoritism and cronyism in awarding federal housing renovation contracts. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said today the program `` was being abused by consultants and some folks who were making a phone call and getting a federal grant.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who addressed to a gathering of state legislators, has halted further spending on the program pending a review of projects. The report, released this week, documented how former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration figures and other Republicans raked in handsome profits on consulting contracts to rehabilitate subsidized apartments for the poor. The consultants included President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first interior secretary, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>; the late <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, attorney general under President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>; former Republican Sen. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and former <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, also a Republican. Other consultants included former top <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials under Reagan-era Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, with one charging fees of $ 1.3 million. Still other former officials under <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> participated as developers in projects to renovate subsidized housing for the poor, benefited by the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> contracts. Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> drew a comparison with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement scandal, with former government officials drawing big fees as consultants to developers seeking government contracts. But <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he had found no evidence that active <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials had been involved in influence-peddling and made no charges of criminal activity. The rehab program is a $ 225 million a year endeavor that survived in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> despite efforts by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to kill it. Through it, developers win contracts to acquire and renovate existing housing and receive <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> guarantees of subsidized rents for 15 years. `` It is indeed ironic that a program that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had sought to terminate for six years was misused to feather the financial nest of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and administration favorites,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said Thursday. He praised the action by <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who ordered a halt to 35 pending awards worth $ 100 million and audits of existing contracts. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said that while he had found no illegality in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s Moderate Rehabilitation Program, contracts were distributed in ways that suggested favoritism and use of insider information Money for over half the units audited went to just 10 states, which by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> formulas were entitled to just 16 percent. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he had turned over the 700-page investigative report to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said in a memo to <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> that developers and local public housing agencies `` were led to believe the consultants enjoyed a special relationship with persons making recommendations and decisions.'' Addressing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> purchasing scandal, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said in his memo: `` In Defense, the contractors were paying consultants to obtain information to influence contract awards. At <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, the developers were paying consultants to influence awards of moderate rehabilitation units to public housing authorities. `` The difference between the two situations is that the investigation at <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> was able to prove that the consultants paid government employees for information and for selecting a particular contractor. Our investigation at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> was unable to substantiate that government employees received any financial consideration from the consultants.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' report questioned the role of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, the former assistant secretary and federal housing commissioner, who was responsible for the program beginning in 1986. The investigation looked into contracts going back to 1984. Investigators found that a nonprofit charity, FOOD for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> headed before joining <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, received $ 290,000 from recipients of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> contracts under the program. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, defending his role in a telephone interview, called the investigative report `` misleading'' and said projects were not awarded based on favoritism. He said it was understandable that former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials would become involved in projects after leaving government because they had developed special knowledge in a narrow, highly technical program. `` If they won those contracts, it was n't because of inside information,'' <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' report named 11 former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials who participated in project contracts as developers and owners, consultants, or representatives of lenders. Among them was former Under Secretary <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> and former Assistant Secretary for Housing <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>. Both were presidential appointees, and later became owner-developers in half a dozen rehabilitation projects. <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> is now the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>; efforts to reach him through the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> were unsuccessful. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> did not return a reporter's call to his <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> office. Others included <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, a former special assistant to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who the report said collected $ 1.3 million in consultant fees on such projects. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s one-time executive assistant, <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, was identified as an owner-developer in six projects. <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> collected a $ 300,000 fee as a consultant on a 312-unit project in <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION>, Md. Investigators reported that he `` said that his role was to talk to the ` right people' and convince them that the project was needed,'' the report said. It said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> was paid $ 375,000 as attorney and consultant on a 1984 <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> project in which he in turn paid <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> $ 75,000 for his assistance. `` <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told him he had <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> contacts from the top on down, because he and -LRB- <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> -RRB- ... were friends,'' the report said. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> told investigators that he knew <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> but that <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> had never discussed <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> matters with him. <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> was paid $ 183,000 as consultant, most of that in a <LOCATION> Lynn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, deal. Also named as a consultant who received $ 260,000 in fees was <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, no relation to the president, who has been nominated as ambassador to <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>. Calls to <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> were not immediately returned.

 City police and federal agents seized 20 weapons, including a grenade launcher, and arrested six people in a raid on a motel in the capital's northeast section early today. A Nazi flag was found in one of two cars with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> license plates searched during the raid, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>, assistant special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> field office. The investigation started Thursday afternoon when a suburban <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> woman called the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> field office to report that her son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnhart </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Rowlette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, had been kidnapped. The unidentified woman said <PERSON> Barnhart </PERSON>, who had been missing two weeks, instructed her to wire him $ 1,000 here or `` some harm would come to him,'' according to <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents traced the man to the motel and quickly determined that he had n't been kidnapped, <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> said. `` Apparently they may have been low on funds and this may have been an effort by him to get some additional funds,'' <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> said. `` It's unfortunate that he would involve his mother.'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents discovered the hotel rooms contained automatic weapons and notified city police, the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> official said. Two of the suspects _ <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McEwen </PERSON>, 40, and his wife, <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> McEwen </PERSON>, 43, both of <LOCATION> Rowlette </LOCATION> _ suffered minor injuries during the police raid when officers had to restrain them from reaching their weapons, said police spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>. Both were briefly treated at <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and released to police custody. The other suspects, in addition to <PERSON> Barnhart </PERSON>, were identified as <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Arredondo </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> McEwen </PERSON>, 28, of <PERSON> Rowlette </PERSON>. All were charged with violating the National Firearms Act. Arraignment was scheduled for later today in federal court. <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> said authorities were still trying to determine why the suspects were at the Econolodge, where they had been staying for several days, and what they were planning to do with the weapons. The weapons seized included a grenade launcher attached to a rifle, some zip guns, several pistols, silencers, and a variety of other semi-automatic and automatic arms, said police Capt. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. `` They're very destructive sort of weapons,'' said <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>. `` They have the power to kill people or to inflict serious bodily injury.'' Six children aged 7 to 15 were found in the motel rooms and taken into protective custody, <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Index Plunges 0.7 Percent in March</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government's chief economic forecasting gauge plunged 0.7 percent in March, the second straight decline and the biggest drop in eight months, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today. It was the first time the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, which dropped 0.3 percent in February, had posted back-to-back declines since it fell for five straight months from September 1987 through January 1988, the months surrounding the October stock market crash. While many analysts feared that the nation was headed for a recession after the market collapse, the economy rebounded with vigor and the record peacetime expansion is now in its seventh year. Analysts said the latest negative signals from the leading index are in line with signs that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy is losing steam and with widespread expectations that the slowdown will become more pronounced as the year progresses. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the report was `` not bad news and shows some slowing of the economy, which is probably good.'' `` Overall it shows the economy is still sound and moving on a steady course,'' he said. Looking at the overall picture, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` Despite declines in February and March, the average of the leading indicators index for the first quarter is higher than the average for the fourth quarter of 1988. The index affirms the slowdown from the high levels of economic activity in 1988 and January of 1989. These declines probably are transitional movements to a sustainable rate of economic growth without accelerating inflation.'' The debate among economists is whether the end result will be an outright recession or a so-called `` soft landing,'' in which growth slows just enough to relieve inflationary pressures without bringing a halt to the expansion. The economy expanded at a strong 5.5 percent annual rate during the first three months of the year, but the growth in the gross national product was a more modest 3 percent, discounting a statistical quirk reflecting the bounce back from last year's drought That was down somewhat from the drought-adjusted 3.5 percent pace for the final quarter of 1988. Monthly reports on the economy's performance in February and March suggested a progressive weakening during the first quarter. `` The underlying growth rate in the economy is much below last year and the risks of a recession certainly are higher,'' said economist <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` To be a prudent planner, you have to take those risks into account.'' March's decline in the leading index, which is designed to predict economic activity six to nine months into the future, was the biggest falloff since a 0.8 percent drop last July. The traditional signal of a recession is three straight declines in the index. However, it has flashed two false recession signals since the 1981-82 economic downturn, one of them in the months after the stock market crash. In March, nine of the 11 indicators that make up the leading index declined, with a drop in building permits counting as the biggest negative factor. Other negatives included: a dip in manufacturers' orders for consumer goods; a shorter average work week; an increase in initial claims for jobless benefits; a drop in an index measuring consumer confidence; faster vendor deliveries, signaling slower demand; a contraction in the money supply; a decline in manufacturers' unfilled orders and falling stock prices Two indicators made positive contributions: a jump in prices for raw materials, indicating stronger demand; and a gain in orders for new plants and equipment. The various changes left the index at 144.4 percent of its 1982 base of 100. The index has advanced 0.5 percent over the past six months, compared with a 2.1 percent rise over the previous six-month period. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> for a year has been pushing up interest rates in an effort to restrain economic growth and control inflation. The goal of the anti-inflation campaign is to prolong the economic recovery, but some analysts think the unintentional result will be a recession. `` The leading indicator is just another indicator of how the economy has slowed down,'' said <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We're at a point now where if the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> does n't back off, the slowdown could very easily become a recession by or before the end of the year.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is projecting the economy will expand at a moderate 3.2 percent pace this year. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Villamil </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said after the first-quarter GNP report was released on Wednesday that `` there is nothing to indicate a recession in 1989 from these numbers.'' He said the nation is experiencing `` solid, moderate growth with the kind of mix we need at this stage of the expansion.'' However, the latest consensus estimate from 50 analysts surveyed by the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indicators </ORGANIZATION> newsletter is less optimistic, projecting this year's growth rate at 2.7 percent, with the pace slipping to 1.2 percent by the fourth quarter. More than half of those surveyed now expect a recession to begin by late this year or early in 1990.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will have at least one opponent when parliament elects the country's new president next month, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Friday. <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravchenko </PERSON>, director general of the official Soviet news agency, said a group of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> deputies plans to present an alternative candidate to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He did not identify the deputies and said he did not know who their candidate was. `` I know from the sentiment of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> there are a group of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> deputies who are going to present an alternative candidate. They did n't tell me who it was. This is not to express distrust of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but to stress the commitment to democracy,'' he told a news conference. The new 2,250-seat <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> will choose the Soviet president and elect 542 of its members to a new full-time legislature, the Supreme Soviet. The president also will be chairman of the Supreme Soviet. The congress will meet May 25-June 1, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> executive said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who replaced <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> as president on Oct. 1, is expected to be chosen. <PERSON> Kravchenko </PERSON> was the first Soviet official to state publicly that the election would be contested. <PERSON> Kravchenko </PERSON>, one of 1,500 deputies elected by voters to the <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the president would be chosen in the early days of the meeting and `` one thing is certain, the procedure will be conducted by secret ballot.'' He said any deputy could propose a candidate `` and the <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> will decide whether to accept the nomination.'' Asked whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s opponent might be former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the political maverick elected to the congress in a landslide following an anti-establishment campaign, <PERSON> Kravchenko </PERSON> replied: `` To stand as an alternative candidate against <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, I do n't think he would want to do that.'' Ten days before the March 26 election, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> started an investigation of charges that <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> opposed some party policies. <PERSON> Kravchenko </PERSON> said none of the speakers at Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting, which he attended, brought up <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> because they realized that a discussion `` would be untimely and hopeless.'' `` In all probability, he -LRB- <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> -RRB- will be nominated to the Supreme Soviet and he stands a good chance to be elected'' by the congress, <PERSON> Kravchenko </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kravchenko </PERSON> indicated deputies from different regions would decide among themselves on slates of nominees for the Supreme Soviet. It has been suggested, he said, that all deputies to the congress from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> _ those elected by the public as well as those chosen from the party and social and professional organizations _ meet May 3. At the meeting, he said, they would decide on a slate for the Supreme Soviet, choosing one nominee from every five deputies. <PERSON> Kravchenko </PERSON> said he expected the same thing to be done in other areas in order to get a `` consolidated list.'' Speaking of the inaugural meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kravchenko </PERSON> said, `` My prediction is there will be a very, very sharp debate. He said he expected the selection of the new Supreme Soviet to take the first two days, after which there would be a short recess. The first session of the Supreme Soviet probably will be held about June 12, he said. Asked about the criticism of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting, he said the `` very critical'' speeches were the result of two major changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> which have n't kept pace with each other, social-economic development and political reform. `` We hoped there would be some harmony between the two but unfortunately this has not come to pass. In the new political structure, there is no doubt great success. Unfortunately, success in the social-economic sphere leaves much to be desired,'' he said. <PERSON> Kravchenko </PERSON> mentioned shortages of consumer goods, higher inflation, social tensions and corruption. He cited proposed reforms including a reduction in state expenditures, a curtailment of capital investment projects and a reduction in defense spending, including the diversion of $ 9.7 million to the health sector. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Popov </PERSON>, the deputy director of Soviet radio and television, when asked how the Soviets assessed the criticism, replied: `` Our assessment is pretty good. We regard them as realistic in today's life. Instead of complacency and good words, we would rather have serious criticism about serious matters.'' <PERSON> Kravchenko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Popov </PERSON> met reporters at the 35-nation East-West conference, which is meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to monitor an accord on media and information signed in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in January. Both are Soviet delegates.

<TEXT>
 Former Teamsters president <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who served three years in prison for bribery, died today at his farm home after a lengthy bout with emphysema and heart problems. He was 74. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a protege of former <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON>, served as international president of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union from 1981-83. He was forced to resign after he and four co-defendants were convicted in December 1982 of trying to bribe former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> to influence trucking deregulation. Cannon was not charged in the case. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> served three years of a 10-year sentence before he was released from federal prison in September. A family spokesman said a doctor was called to the <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> house about 70 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> about 5 a.m. when <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> experienced trouble breathing. The spokesman said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> did not want to go to the hospital at that time and went back to sleep. Dr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> said he returned to the house with paramedics after <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> became acutely ill but he could not be revived. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> died of complications of emphysema, <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> said. Teamsters headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had no immediate comment on <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' death. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>, had no kind words for <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> or <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> when he testified before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> April 4: `` One was a cheat and one was a liar and both were mixed up with <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nostra </ORGANIZATION> by their own admissions. I did n't care for either one of them,'' he said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> claimed he was set up in the attempted bribery case. In an interview early this year, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said: `` I am still just an old truck driver at heart. It's over now and I am glad of it. I still have to meet my maker. But I can still say I did n't do nothing wrong.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> testified at a casino skimming trial in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> several years ago that he had received payments from <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Civella </PERSON>, the late <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> crime boss, for helping mob figures obtain a $ 60 million loan from a union pension fund. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said in an interview later that he did so only after his family was threatened and on the advice of <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON>. In his testimony, which he gave in an attempt to have his sentence reduced, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said that he received payoffs of $ 1,500 a month from <PERSON> Civella </PERSON> for seven years when he was a local labor leader. He said <PERSON> Civella </PERSON> played a key role in his election to the union's international presidency. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> also testified by videotape in a federal court trial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> against mob figures accused of fixing his election as <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> president, and that of his successor, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, who died last July.

 The shuttle Atlantis and its five astronauts were ready for a midafternoon launch today on a mission to start a robot craft streaking toward <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, the cloud-shrouded planet that is an abiding mystery to scientists. The crew finished final spacecraft checks and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials said the space probe called <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> was ready as the 23-minute launch window approached. The schedule called for liftoff no earlier than 2:24 p.m. <PERSON> Lennard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist, said launch of the explorer craft <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> will mark `` a resurgence of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s planetary program. The last American probe to deep space was dispatched in 1978. Preparations moved smoothly since the countdown began Tuesday. A launch control commentator announced `` all conditions look good'' for launch time weather in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Officials kept close watch on wind conditions at emergency landing sites here and across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Atlantis was scheduled to lift off at 2:24 p.m. EDT, heading to orbit on a four-day mission 184 miles above <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Launch pad workers completed fueling early this morning. After breakfast, the astronauts donned the bright orange launch suits they would wear into space. They smiled and waved to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> workers as they headed to their beachfront launch pad. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> is to be released from Atlantis' cargo bay six hours after launch and sent streaking on a 15-month, 806 million-mile unmanned trip of its own. Mission specialists <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleave </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> will operate remote controls that propel <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> from the shuttle's cargo bay. Atlantis is commanded by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. The other crew members are pilot <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabe </PERSON> and mission specialist <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Thagard </PERSON>. The liftoff opportunity, dictated by <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>'s path to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and lighting conditions at emergency landing sites, lasts only 23 minutes, one of the shortest launch windows in shuttle history. After its release from the shuttle, <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>'s own rocket will send it out of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> orbit. Over the next 15 months, the craft will fly around the sun 1 -LCB- times before settling into an orbit of Venus in August 1990. <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> has intrigued humans as long as they've looked heavenward and marveled at the universe. The planet, the familiar `` star'' of the morning or evening, appears just before dawn or just after sunset as a brilliant, unblinking point of light. Its brightness in the nighttime sky is rivaled only by the moon. <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s nearest neighbor, with an orbit 25.7 million miles away, and the two often are considered to be sister planets since they are about the same size. But the worlds differ mightily: Dense clouds of carbon dioxide choke <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, which has a surface temperature of about 900 degrees, hot enough to melt lead. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> will be carrying some of the most sophisticated remote mapping sensors ever sent to another planet. An imaging radar system will be able to detect features on the surface as small as 100 yards, about the size of a football field. The radar will be operated during almost 2,000 passes over the <LOCATION> Venusian </LOCATION> surface, each time viewing a slice of the planet and then sending the image back to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> for computer enhancements. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> is expected to map about 90 percent of the surface while orbiting <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> for about 243 Earth days, equal to a single Venus day. The last <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planetary probe was the <LOCATION> Pioneer-Venus </LOCATION>, launched in 1978. <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> said that in the 11 years since, `` we had a planetary program that was in danger of being an also-ran.'' <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> is the first in a series of American planetary exploration missions. Voyager 2, a probe launched in 1977 and an earlier visitor to <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> and Uranus, will fly past <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> in August. In October, the robot craft <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> will be launched toward Jupiter. A space telescope will be launched next year, followed by probes to the sun in October 1990, and to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> in 1992. `` Nobody is going to question our leadership in planetary -LRB- exploration -RRB- again,'' <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> said at a Thursday news conference. Its cloud cover blocks telescope views of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and until the Space Age little was known about the planet's surface. Twenty space probes have been sent to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, including four by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but only tiny fragments of the surface have been photographed. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> project scientist, said the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> studies may help scientists understand how the Earth developed into a place where life flourishes while <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> became a world of torrid heat.

 Fantastic dreams of taking home all of a record $ 115 million jackpot from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s Super 7 lottery slipped away as 14 winning tickets turned up in an initial computer scan of wagers. Lottery Executive Director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON> said each of the 14 tickets will be worth $ 317,524.67 in annual payments over the next 26 years. If one person had won the jackpot, it would have been worth $ 4.4 million a year. Still, the first winners to step forward were happy Thursday to claim just a share, even if the money wo n't bring early retirements. `` It's better than nothing,'' said <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Samsa </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, who served as spokesman for a group of 14 workers from the Harbison-Walker brick factory in <LOCATION> Windham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. If their ticket is validated, possibly early next week, each of the 14 will get $ 22,680 a year before taxes for 26 years. <PERSON> Alverto </PERSON> <PERSON> Handel </PERSON>, 65, of <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; her son, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, 39, a coal miner from <LOCATION> Summerhill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; and daughter, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 34, a library technician at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, also presented a ticket for validation. Holders of four more winning tickets checked in this morning, lottery officials said, brining the number of claimings to step forward to six families or groups. Two couples from the Erie area put in a claim for a ticket they shared. They are <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> of <PERSON> McKean </PERSON> <PERSON> Township </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Harborcreek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>. Asked how he felt, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 32, said, `` I ca n't even remember. I have n't slept.'' A family from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, arrived early this afternoon. Members of the <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> family said the group had bought $ 80 worth of tickets after waiting one hour in line. Another winner, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Trapuzzano </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said she had spent Thursday in a Harrisburg-area motel pondering her good fortune before putting in her claim. `` I was shocked and I could n't believe it,'' she said as she was led into lottery headquarters past a crowd of reporters and photographers. Miss <PERSON> Trapuzzano </PERSON> said her father, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON>, had bought five tickets for her and her two brothers and sister after she was unable to get her own because of long lines. Also claiming tickets was a group from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>: <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>; <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Connie </PERSON>. Coincidentally, it was a year ago today that a bogus winning ticket for a $ 15.2 million jackpot was turned in and a check for nearly $ 470,000 was issued by lottery officials. An employee of the lottery's computer contractor who had access to the system produced the fake ticket and an accomplice turned it in. Lottery officials discovered the scheme several days later and recovered the money. Both men received jail terms after pleading guilty. The lottery has since beefed up its validation process, which can take days to complete. A second set of computers must also validate the jackpot and the number of winning tickets before both become official, <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON> said. Reports circulated Thursday about winners who were set to claim shares of this week's jackpot. `` Just fine, no problem,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said when asked about having to share the jackpot. Mrs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> came up with six of the numbers from a computer palm reader she had tried in an open air market during a <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> vacation with her husband, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, in March. Her mother provided the seventh number. She was at a bowling alley near her <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, home when her mother called her. `` It was a total shock ... I dropped the phone,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> said she was so excited she nearly put the pencil through the paper she was working on as she checked the lottery numbers shotly after Wednesday's drawing. The winner was the first ticket she checked. `` Tears came to my eyes,'' she said. `` I was so dumbfounded, I could n't even look at the other tickets.'' Each of their shares will be worth $ 105,841 a year for 26 years. They said they had no plans for the money yet. Besides getting less than they may have hoped for, members of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> group could n't even get the detailed and lengthy validation process started. The lottery usually tells winning groups who call in ahead of time that they need a formal legal agreement spelling out how the money will be disbursed. The group said they tried to call first, but could n't get through. `` They got excited ... and headed on down,'' <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON> said after the group drove six hours in a four-vehicle caravan. The group, which had bought $ 140 in tickets, contacted an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> lawyer, who promised to have a contract delivered to lottery headquarters today. <PERSON> Samsa </PERSON> called the legal holdup `` a slight disappointment, but it's nothing we ca n't overcome.''

 Rescuers pulled 48 bodies from the twisted wreckage of tornado-battered villages on Friday and a dozen people died in hospitals, raising the death toll to 660, officials said. Hundreds more remained missing and officials said deaths from the storm may would exceed 1,000. Relatives of the dead wailed and recited holy chants as rescuers labored in the debris in <LOCATION> Saturia </LOCATION>, one of more than 20 small villages in central <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> hit hard by the storm. The toll jumped sharply on Friday when rescuers recovered 40 bodies in <LOCATION> Saturia </LOCATION> and and nearby <LOCATION> Harganj </LOCATION>, according <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials speaking on the condition they not be identified. Another eight bodies were found in the village of <LOCATION> Dhamrai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Upazila </LOCATION>, and 12 people injured in the storm died in hospitals, they said. About 400 people have been listed as missing, including 200 fisherman whose boats were capsized. An army officer supervising the rescue, speakng on condition of anoymity, said the final death toll may exceed 1,000. At least 12,000 people have been injured. The tornado swept into the <LOCATION> Manikganj </LOCATION> area, 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, on Wednesday night, blowing away people, animals and houses. Another tornado reportedly hit the <LOCATION> Narsingdi </LOCATION> district, 25 miles east of the capital, killing five people and injuring 500. <PERSON> Saturia </PERSON> was perhaps the hardest hit. `` The tornado swooped on the area like an elephant trunk and within minutes nothing except the dead and injured was left,'' said <PERSON> Faruk </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, a district official. The storm came during two months of draught that has wiped out half of this impoverished nation's rice crop. Late last year, torrential rains flooded more than two-thirds of the country, and a cyclone killed hundreds of people. Nature's latest blow left <LOCATION> Saturia </LOCATION>, a village of 10,000 people, a chaotic mass of twisted trees, utility poles and corrugated iron sheets. A group of wailing and sobbing people carried a body to a burial spot behind a crumbled building. `` I was here during the devastating flood last year in which more than 20 persons had died. But I have not seen anything so devastating as the tornado,'' <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> said. In the nearby village of <LOCATION> Tilli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Char </LOCATION>, at least 80 people, some seriously hurt, waited for medical attention outside a tin school shed being used as a hospital.

<HEAD>Arab Burned in Failed Terror Attack, Police Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A kerosene-laden car driven by a Palestinian holding a detonator burst into flames Friday on a busy <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> street, and police said it apparently was a failed attack by a terrorist. In other incidents in the occupied territories, assailants shot and killed a Palestinian suspected of cooperating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers reportedly shot and wounded 10 Palestinians. Another Palestinian, a 14-year-old boy, was shot in the head by <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> settlers, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The driver of the car that exploded near police headquarters in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> was hospitalized with severe burns. There were no other injuries. The car's trunk was loaded with six containers of kerosene and two canisters of cooking gas, said police spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON>. The man was seen holding a detonator just before the vehicle exploded, he added. Police believe the car was being rigged as a bomb and went off prematurely. `` We believe it might be a terrorist act that failed,'' said <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON>. He identified the driver as a Palestinian from east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shoafat </LOCATION> district who has a criminal record for disturbing the peace <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> did not release the name of the man, a veterinarian who once worked for the city. The army, meanwhile, confirmed a man died Friday when he was shot in the mouth and head in the crowded main square of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. A spokesman said they still are checking the circumstances. Palestinian reporters said the victim, <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samt </PERSON>, 38, was suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. His death brings to at least 40 the number of suspected collaborators killed by fellow Palestinians since the December 1987 start of the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. Another 415 Palestinians have been shot and killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. Palestinians have killed 18 Israelis in that time. At <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, 14-year-old <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdia </PERSON> was in serious condition after being shot Friday by Jewish settlers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. An army spokeswoman confirmed a <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> resident was hospitalized, and said authorities are investigating how he was injured. Another gang of about 50 heavily armed <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlers marched through <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s Arab neighborhood of <LOCATION> Silwan </LOCATION> on Friday. Some waved <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flags and shouted in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION> and Arabic: `` The Jews are here! The Jews are here!'' When about half a dozen Palestinian boys aged 8-10 stoned them from a nearby hilltop, the settlers held their submachine guns up in warning. The marchers then alerted police who fired tear gas to disperse the stone throwers. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said downtown <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> was declared a closed military area after a series of clashes between soldiers and stone-throwing Palestinians on Friday. Two Palestinians were wounded by army gunfire, the radio said. An army spokeswoman also confirmed troops wounded a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> woman during clashes in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. She said she is checking <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospital reports that seven other Palestinians were shot and wounded by troops in confrontations in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Also Friday, an army investigation found the use of gunfire by border police during a search-and-arrest raid in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Nahalin </LOCATION> was `` exaggerated,'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. The 25 border policemen fired 150 live bullets, killing five people and wounding at least 15 during the April 13 incident, the radio quoted the report as saying.

 Romanian authorities briefly detained a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy official who met with a critic of the Communist government and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has filed a protest, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said Friday. While under international law, contacts between diplomats and local citizens are permissible, the incident is being played down by the department and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> out of concern that additional strictures might be imposed on Romanians. Despite the economic and political reform movement sweeping the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> remains hard-line in its policies. The diplomat's identify was withheld. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, the department spokeswoman, said the diplomat was detained for 10 minutes on Tuesday and was not accused of any specific infraction. She and other officials declined to disclose the name of the Romanian. Sources in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> speculated that the Romanian was one of six <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> veterans who had written a letter to <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> earlier in the year sharply critical of his policies. The letter called for more human rights at home, an immediate halt to food exports and the revocation of plans to destroy thousands of villages as part of a plan to create agricultural and industrial centers. The signers included former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Corneliu </PERSON> <PERSON> Manescu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Silviu </PERSON> <PERSON> Brucan </PERSON>, a former ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Despite its hard-line domestic policies, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> for years has operated with considerable independence from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in foreign affairs. It does not permit Soviet troops on its territory and did not support Soviet military intervention in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 1968. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> has maintained diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and permitted massive Jewish emigration for which it was rewarded with special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade privileges.

<HEAD>Mayo Clinic Reports Success in Helping Smokers Quit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 More than three-quarters of people trying to quit smoking were able to do so for six weeks with the help of nicotine patches, researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. In a preliminary study that started last fall, 24 of 31 people who wore nicotine patches had stopped smoking, said Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Mayo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Smoking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cessation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and one of the investigators. The silver-dollar-sized patches release nicotine slowly through the skin into the bloodstream. A control group in the study wore patches not treated with nicotine, and only 12 of 31 participants quit smoking. Hurt cautioned that a long-term follow-up study is needed, but said the patch could be a tool to help people stop smoking. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinney </PERSON>, executive director of the Institute for the Study of Smoking Behavior and Policy at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the results are consistent with other research on the patches. But he agreed with Hurt that a follow-up is important to assess whether the quitters remain non-smokers after a year. `` The relapse rate begins to accelerate from three to six months,'' <PERSON> Pinney </PERSON> said. The patch, similar to those used for dispensing medicine, contains 30 milligrams of nicotine. About 1 milligram of nicotine is absorbed through the skin every hour so smokers are better able to handle the withdrawal symptoms associated with quitting smoking. The Mayo Clinic is one of four centers studying the patch for possible <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> approval. The others are in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The 62 people who participated in <LOCATION> Mayo </LOCATION>'s nicotine study were randomly divided into two groups with 31 receiving nicotine patches and 31 receiving placebo patches that looked identical but contained no nicotine, <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> said. All were monitored weekly by a nurse who checked carbon monoxide levelsto confirm whether they had been smoking. After the six weeks, 24 people with nicotine patches had quit smoking and 12 with placebo patches had quit, <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> said. Of those who still smoked, all who had nicotine patches and 15 of the 19 on placebo patches had reduced their smoking by more than half. The people who wore the nicotine patches were, by chance, significantly heavier smokers before the study, Hurt said. They smoked a median of 30 cigarettes daily, compared with 25 smoked daily by the placebo group. Both groups had smoked for about 20 years. Researchers will track the participants at three-month intervals for a year to determine whether they continue without cigarettes. Hurt said research at the three other centers may show that fewer people quit in both groups but there is still likely to be a 2 to 1 ratio of nicotine patch quitters to placebo patch quitters. The American Cancer Sociey estimates that cigarette smoking is responsible for 83 percent of the cases of lung cancer. Smoking accounts for 30 percent of all cancer deaths.

 Five-year-old <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hains </PERSON> surprised doctors when he offered to donate his own heart if he dies, but his mother said Friday she's used to the boy's courage as he waits for a heart-lung transplant. `` It did n't really surprise me. I'm proud of him,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hains </PERSON> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Roseville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, where she awaits word from <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and Clinics about a transplant for <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON>. `` He actually thinks it's funny that he's still alive, really,'' she said. `` He says ` I guess I fooled them.' He loves life and loves people and I guess he's just not ready to go.'' <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> suffers from cystic fibrosis, a fatal genetic disease in which lungs become clogged with mucus because of malfunctioning gland secretions. The boy has been on a national donor list since March 1988 when pneumonia weakened his lungs. Doctors say they want to do a heart-lung transplant because it would reduce chances of his body rejecting the lungs. His heart is healthy. On March 2, a donor was found. <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> was prepared for the transplant and was moments away from the operating room when doctors determined the donor's lungs were too full of fluid. Mrs. <PERSON> Hains </PERSON> said before the transplant was canceled, doctors asked <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> if he realized that he might die during the operation and the boy responded calmly, `` of course.'' She said <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> even surprised his doctors more by telling them he wanted them to donate his heart should he die on the operating table. `` You ca n't throw out a good heart,'' he told them. `` It's from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>.'' The family's home is in <LOCATION> Cudahy </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> suburb, but Mrs. <PERSON> Hains </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> have taken an apartment in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> to be near the hospital. <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> has grown weaker this week, she said, but his enthusiasm for life and his interest in the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewers </ORGANIZATION> baseball team has n't waned. `` I tell him the <ORGANIZATION> Brewers </ORGANIZATION> win and he smiles,'' she said. `` He has me wake him up -LRB- every night -RRB- to let him know what the score is.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hains </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, have three other children, ages 11, 8 and 7. A bank in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> is handling an account for donations to the family to help with medical bills.

 The government said Friday its chief economic forecasting gauge took a 0.7 percent nose dive in March, marking the first back-to-back declines in more than a year in a portent of progressive weakening in the economy. Last month's drop in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, which is designed to foretell economic activity six to nine months into the future, followed a 0.3 percent dip in February and was the biggest falloff since a 0.8 percent decline last July. Should the index point downward again for April, that would make three declines in a row, the traditional signal of a forthcoming recession. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the report was `` not bad news and shows some slowing of the economy which is probably good.'' `` Overall it shows the economy is still sound and moving on a steady course,'' he said. Analysts said the performance of the index thus far is another indication that the economy is losing steam and that the slowdown will become more pronounced later this year. `` It's very clear we're going to have a very marked and worrisome slowdown in the economy,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Levy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecasts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chappaqua </LOCATION>, N.Y. Whether the slowdown will deteriorate into a recession is `` a neck-and-neck race at the moment,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that the declines `` probably are transitional movements to a sustainable rate of economic growth without accelerating inflation.'' `` Despite declines in February and March, the average of the leading indicators index for the first quarter is higher than the average for the fourth quarter of 1988,'' he said. Using the three-month rule of thumb, the index correctly forecast all eight recessions that have occurred since 1948, but it also gave false signals of a downturn on five other occasions. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> said that in each of the five cases in which a recession did not occur, the economy still experienced a significant slowdown in growth. `` I do n't see any real -LRB- recession -RRB- signal yet, but if we do get another month or two of decline and if history repeats itself, we would be looking for either a significant slowdown or a recession,'' <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said. The last time the index registered two straight declines was when it fell for five straight months from September 1987 through January 1988, the months surrounding the October stock market crash. While many analysts feared that the nation was headed for a recession after the market collapse, the economy rebounded and the record peacetime expansion is now in its seventh year. For the past year, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has been pushing up interest rates in an effort to restrain economic growth and thus control inflation. However, some analysts have expressed concern that the anti-inflation campaign will prove too potent and stifle the economic expansion. White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, speaking to a consumer group Friday, said the administration does n't want higher interest rates that would `` scrunch down'' the economy. `` This economy is strong, it is robust, and it will continue to thrive as long as we do n't adopt policies to scrunch it down,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> persists in slowing the economy, there is a very real danger of throwing the economy into a recession,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, deputy chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` Putting people out of work is bad economic policy and indefensible as a way to combat inflation.'' Other analysts hold to the belief that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will be able to engineer a so-called `` soft landing,'' in which growth slows enough to cool inflation without causing a recession. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, dean of the business school at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the economy still is flying `` at a very high altitude. We can bounce around some, but I do n't think there is any evidence yet that we're going to have a very serious decline.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said that while the economy is showing signs of slowing, `` I do n't think it's falling off a cliff.'' `` We're moving from what was a robust pace of growth last year to a moderate pace of growth this year,'' <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said. In March, nine of the 11 indicators that make up the leading index declined, with a drop in building permits counting as the biggest negative factor. Other negatives included: a dip in manufacturers' orders for consumer goods; a shorter average work week; an increase in initial claims for jobless benefits; a drop in an index measuring consumer confidence; faster vendor deliveries, signaling slower demand; a contraction in the money supply; a decline in manufacturers' unfilled orders and falling stock prices Two indicators made positive contributions: a jump in prices for raw materials, indicating stronger demand; and a gain in orders for new plants and equipment. The various changes left the index at 144.4 percent of its 1982 base of 100. The index has advanced 0.5 percent over the past six months, compared with a 2.1 percent rise over the previous six-month period.

 <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s family will gather to remember her, but there will be no funeral, a spokesman said Friday. `` It is n't going to be a formal service, as such. What is going on is totally private, with the family, and I do n't know when or where,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Lucille </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>. Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> died unexpectedly of a burst aorta Wednesday, eight days after emergency heart surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. She was 77. Her family said afterward through a spokesman there would be no funeral for the red-haired comic actress, who starred with her then-husband <PERSON> Desi </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON> in the 1951-1957 `` I Love Lucy'' series that revolutionized TV. Reports later said there would be a private funeral. But when asked if such a service would take place, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said, `` Not in the usual sense of the term, no.'' `` It's carrying out <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>'s own wishes in this regard, and she just wanted everything to be very quiet, with her own immediate loved ones,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. `` There's not going to be that kind of formal service.'' He had no information on burial plans. Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> was being memorialized by fans who continued Friday to call her offices to express their condolences. `` We have been inundated, as has almost every agency she has been involved with. People who were only mildly connected to her, along with fans from all over the world have been calling here,'' said <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>. Television stations around the country also planned or had already offered `` I Love Lucy'' weekend marathons. An 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. commercial-free <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> marathon is planned for Saturday on <ORGANIZATION> KTTV </ORGANIZATION>, Channel 11 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` It's very much appreciated,'' said <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>. `` It's nice enough to do it, but to do that and give up their advertising revenue for 10 hours, that's a wonderful, wonderful tribute on their part.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> WNYW </ORGANIZATION>, Channel 5, ran two hours of classic `` I Love Lucy'' episodes Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> has 60 hours of <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> programming, and announced it will run a mini-retrospective next week.

<TEXT>
 Convicted murderer <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> must turn over $ 90,000 in profits from her autobiography to a state board that dispenses cash to crime victims, a judge ruled. The <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> argued successfully that under state law, profits from the book, `` Stranger in Two Worlds,'' should benefit survivors of Dr. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarnower </PERSON>, the man Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> killed. Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> sought to donate the money to <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bedford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a fund for the children of inmates at the <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Correctional Facility, where she is serving a sentence of 15 years to life for the March 1979 murder of the creator of the <LOCATION> Scarsdale </LOCATION> diet. The prison charity argued in a lawsuit that garnishing the money would violate Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>'s constitutional rights under the First and 14th amendments. <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubin </ORGANIZATION> found otherwise, ruling Thursday in the board's favor. `` I think this ruling is very important in terms of the life of the statute and the ability for victims to receive compensation,'' <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abate </PERSON>, board chairwoman, said Friday. The money will be placed in escrow for up to five years. Under the law, survivors of <PERSON> Tarnower </PERSON> must obtain a civil judgment in order to obtain the money. If none comes forward, it will be returned to Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 65, has written another book about her prison experiences, `` They Always Call Us Ladies,'' which is not covered by the state's so-called `` Son of Sam'' law because it does not discuss the murder of <PERSON> Tarnower </PERSON>, her longtime lover. Seventy pages of `` Stranger in Two Worlds'' deal with <PERSON> Tarnower </PERSON>, his death and her subsequent trial.

 Episcopal parishioners are upset by a bishop's directive forbidding the formal blessing of same-sex relationships, a priest said Friday `` The disappointment is that once again it seems that the church just does n't seem to be able to extricate itself from cultural mores,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Valantasis </PERSON>, co-rector of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> the Evangelist Parish. He estimated that about one-third of the congregation is homosexual. The <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> accepts homosexuals as members, but is still studying the issues of ordination and blessing, said the Rev. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> G.C </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bayne </PERSON>, chairman of a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> diocesan commission on sexuality. `` The church's mind is not determined,'' he said. The blessing generally is used as a form of church recognition of an outside marriage, such as a civil ceremony. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s clergy proposed blessing the 15-year relationship of two women, but the ceremony would have made no reference to marriage, <PERSON> Valantasis </PERSON> said. Some Episcopalians have trouble with the concept of endorsing homosexual unions, said the Rev. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> `` The fear is that it's a very short step from blessing relationships to being in a position of saying this is a same-sex marriage,'' he said. Some Episcopal parishes have quietly been extending their blessing to same-sex couples in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> for years, <PERSON> Valantasis </PERSON> said, but in the case of St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s, rectors proposed the blessing take place during the sacrament of Eucharist and asked for official approval. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, bishop of the 96,000-member Episcopal diocese of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, responded by letter dated April 20, saying the blessing would be inappropriate. `` We feel that that's another way of being abusive to gay people ... by giving the appearance that nothing is happening,'' said <PERSON> Valantasis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> declined to comment Friday, said diocesan spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Solheim </PERSON>. Opponents to endorsing same-sex unions cite biblical passages condemning homosexuality. `` I'm one of those who feels that the church ought to offer support and concern and compassion to people of whatever lifestyle but it does seem to me that we ca n't easily get around the teaching of the scriptures which do not condone homosexual conduct,'' <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Valantasis </PERSON> responded, `` If we take all of those moral injunctions, then we should also be condemning alcoholics.'' Parishioner <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> said most of St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s approximately 200 members were pleased when <PERSON> Valantasis </PERSON> and co-rector the Rev. <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said they were seeking authorization. `` The congregation, as one person, as far as I could tell, got to their feet and cheered, which is very unusual,'' she said. Miles, the <PERSON> Bussey </PERSON> professor of historical theology at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Divinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said news that the blessing had been stopped was crushing. <PERSON> Valantasis </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> hope to discuss the issue further with <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` I think that this is a very volatile issue and it comes to the sort of heart of our cultural fabric,'' <PERSON> Valantasis </PERSON> said.

 When the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> pulled the last of its soldiers out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> two months ago, 313 were left behind, lost during the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s nine-year involvement in the civil war. Some were shot down and possibly killed. Some were captured by Moslem guerrillas and held in prison camps in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Others just wandered outside one day and vanished. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has turned for help to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which still is trying to trace the 2,400 American servicemen who disappeared during the Vietnam War. `` It's a problem that would cost the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> nothing to help solve and would mean a great deal to us,'' said <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ambassador </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and first deputy prime minister to President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` You Americans should n't have any trouble understanding why this is so important to us,'' <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said the issue has been raised with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in hopes <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will use its influence as the guerrillas' principal weapons supplier. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the issue is a `` matter of humanitarian concern,'' and it has urged the Soviets and guerrilla representatives to reach an agreement for the exchange of POWs. `` We have discussed the exchange of POWs with representatives of the Afghan resistance. We have conveyed to the resistance and to the Soviets our position that there should be no involuntary repatriation of POWs,'' said a department official, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said his country has given the names of 313 missing soldiers to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do n't expect all of them to be alive,'' he said. `` We just want to know what happened to them.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> is allowed to visit POW camps in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which serves as the base for the guerrillas waging an 11-year-old war with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Communist government. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials refuse to disclose any details about their visits, including prisoners' identifies and conditions. They say it is difficult to say how many prisoners are held by the Moslem guerrillas. `` There are tens, maybe hundreds of groups fighting, and their connection is quite loose,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> official. `` Some -LRB- prisoners -RRB- are released, others are exchanged, transferred from one rebel group to another, or executed,'' the worker said, speaking on condition of anonymity. According to rebel sources in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, four Soviet POWs were traded recently for 100 guerrillas in one of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s northern provinces. There was no independent confirmation. The rebel sources say it is unlikely there are more than 75 Soviet prisoners _ if that many _ alive in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. And despite what the guerrillas call good will gestures, they have said they want to keep their prisoners as bargaining chips should they capture the capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` They always have an excuse,'' <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said. `` First they did n't want to talk until the Soviet troops were gone. Now that they are, they say they'll only talk when there's a full settlement.'' On Feb. 15, under a U.N.-sponsored accord, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> pulled out the last of its troops, ending a military involvement that began in December 1979. The communists had come to power in an April 1978 coup that led to the guerrilla insurgency.

But <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he had not made any request. He said party officials approached him several months ago and asked if he wanted to become a member again. `` They asked me how I would react, and I said I would not object.'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said he never considered asking to be restored as a party member during the rule of President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> because, `` That was another epoch.'' <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> died in 1982. Like many Soviets who had fallen out of official favor for what once was considered dissent, <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> has gradually been restored to good graces. He has appeared at officially sponsored news conferences, been quoted frequently in the official press and was elected April 9 as a deputy to the new Soviet parliament, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said it was <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>'s book about <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s crimes, `` Let History Judge,'' that prompted his expulsion from the party in 1969, but that the control committee determined that action was `` unfounded'' and restored his membership. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> has said `` Let History Judge,'' which he started writing in 1962, was `` the main work of my life.'' Seeing a possibility that <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> would be restored posthumously to official good graces despite his crimes, <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> decided to have the book published abroad. It came out in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and several other countries in 1971. But it was n't until this year that it appeared in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The literary journal <LOCATION> Znamya </LOCATION> published the first part of `` Let History Judge'' in its January issue. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> is to put out the entire book, an indictment of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s dictatorial rule. Under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness, it is no longer considered dissent to condemn <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> or report his crimes. In fact, the Soviet press is full of articles about <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s personality cult <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> has estimated that 40 million Soviets were either killed, arrested or otherwise repressed under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, and his figure _ along with other of his remarks about <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> _ have appeared in the Soviet press. He believes _ as does <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> _ that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can move toward a democratic political system without abandoning fundamental tenets of Marxism-Leninism. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Zhores </PERSON>, were among the first prominent members of what evolved into the Soviet dissident movement. <PERSON> Zhores </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, a biochemist and gerontologist, was placed in a psychiatric hospital before he was forced to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 1973. Human rights campaigner <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> was an important influence on him, even though they later separated. After his expulsion from the party, authorities tolerated <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, and he became a valuable, unofficial source for journalists seeking information about Soviet history and politics.

 Somebody give this man a medal. No, not <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Robe </PERSON>, the producer, writer and director of the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> movie `` Guts & amp; Glory: The Rise and Fall of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>.'' For a film hurriedly made and rushed onto the air in time for the important May rating period and the expected conclusion of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial, it is surprisingly good. It airs in two parts, Sunday and Tuesday. The crisply written script is based on <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s book of the same name But Robe adds another dimension to the `` docudrama,'' turning it into his own statement on the Iran-Contra affair: he has added a fictional character, a White House aide who serves as the film's conscience _ since nobody apparently fulfilled such a role in real life. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Quinn </PERSON>, turns up in part one of the movie as a mentor to North when the Marine colonel joins the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON> even suggests gently to North at one point that some things, such as his children, are more important than fighting Communists. Later in the movie, after the news of the Iran-Contra scandal has broken, <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON> confronts <PERSON> North </PERSON>, arguing that the operation was an attack on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> democracy, not the grand, heroic gesture <PERSON> North </PERSON> believed it to be. `` How many hostages are back?'' <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON> demands. `` For all those missiles you sold to the same damn people who blew up barracks and murdered 241 American boys? Shame on us!'' North argues, `` We tried the only thing we thought would work'' to free the hostages, and insists that, in the case of arms to the Nicaraguan Contras, `` we're fighting for democracy down there.'' `` By keeping it from democracy here! Sell that somewhere else, Colonel,'' <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON> retorts. By the end of the film, when <PERSON> North </PERSON> is faced with charges and colleagues are running for cover, <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON> again confronts him: `` What you guys tried to pull,'' he says, `` was nothing short of a secret government, the most dangerous threat to my country I can imagine.'' North sticks to his guns. As a Marine, he says, he fights `` any way I can.'' The appearance of <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON> does not turn `` Guts & amp; Glory'' into an anti-Oliver North movie, largely due to the strength and guts of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>'s portrayal of the colonel. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> has said in interviews that he is a big fan of the real North. <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON> does justice to <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, here portrayed as a sympathetic, three-dimensional character, not the paperdoll cutout of a housewife that would have been easier. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stock-Poynton </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Fawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> as an earnest defender of the cause. There are good performances all around, especially <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dooley </PERSON> as National Security Adviser <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> as Admiral <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> does a credible impersonation of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. As if to counterbalance the creation of <LOCATION> Sykes </LOCATION>, Robe includes another, if not fictional, then at least questionable episode. At the beginning of part two of the movie, North is shown piloting a plane over <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, landing it under enemy fire and rescuing Salvadoran soldiers. The story has been told but not substantiated. <PERSON> Bradlee </PERSON> included it in his book with a note that it might not be true. Even if it is n't true, it makes for a good movie _ not unlike <PERSON> North </PERSON> himself.

 Fourteen British soccer fans were convicted of involuntary manslaughter today and sentenced to three years in prison for their roles in a 1985 riot that killed 39 people at <LOCATION> Heysel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>. The fans, all from <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>, also were fined $ 1,538 each. Eleven fans were acquitted. The three-judge panel that handed down the verdicts suspended half of each prison sentence. Afterward, the 14 convicted fans left <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. They have 15 days to appeal their sentence. The 14 have already served six months in pre-trial custody, which means they probably would serve no more than a few months behind bars. In <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, convicts generally serve a third of their sentence. After the May 29, 1985, disaster, English soccer clubs, such as <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Manchester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, were banned from European competition. The ban did not affect <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s national teams, which still can compete for the European Cup and the World Cup. The verdicts came in the wake of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s worst sports disaster. On April 15, 95 people were killed in a stadium stampede when fans tried to crowd into a standing-room-only section during a match between <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Nottingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosens </PERSON>, the former Belgian <ORGANIZATION> Soccer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> chairman, was given a six-month suspended sentence for negligence and poor organization of the Heysel soccer match. A senior police officer, <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahieu </PERSON>, received a nine-month suspended sentence for grave omissions of duty. Belgian police officer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kensier </PERSON> was acquitted. In a separate civil action brought by family members and heard by the same judicial panel that heard the criminal case, four officials were found not liable for the deaths that resulted from the tragedy. They included <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Georges </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s ruling soccer body; former organization General Secetary <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON>; <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Herve </PERSON> <PERSON> Brouhon </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Viviane </PERSON> <PERSON> Baro </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> alderman for sports. `` I wish wholeheartedly we will never have to face court again and that soccer will only bring family entertainment from now on,'' <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> said. In addition to the 39 deaths, more than 500 people were injured when <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> fans rioted at <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heysel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> just prior to 1985 <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> soccer championship final between <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Juventus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turin </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Eighteen days earlier, 56 soccer fans had died in a fire at <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION> stadium. Belgian authorities had requested the extradition of 27 Britons based on videotapes and pictures showing <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> fans tearing down the flimsy fence separating them from Italian supporters. Two already were being held in British jails on unrelated charges, bringing the number extradited to 25. The invasion of the stands caused a panic during which victims were trampled to death as they tried to flee. Most of the victims were Italian. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> complied with the extradition request in September 1987, and the five-month trial began Oct. 17, 1988. Closing arguments ended March 20. Sir <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON>, one of the defense lawyers, said an appeal was likely. `` The acquittals are OK, but I am disappointed they've handed out custodial sentences to the others,'' he said. `` I do n't think they would have to serve more than between 10 and 12 months. But I was hoping the whole of their sentences would be suspended.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Erauw </PERSON> said he saw no need to keep the 14 convicted fans behind bars pending appeal. `` I thought there was no need as most of them came to -LRB- Friday's -RRB- hearing,'' he told reporters, adding that unless an appeal is filed, the 14 `` will receive an invitation to come to prison.''

 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and South African officials disagree about how many nationalist guerrillas remain in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> despite orders to withdraw, a South African diplomat said Friday. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heerden </PERSON>, director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> believes 400 guerrillas still are in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, while officials of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring force put the figure at 200. <PERSON> Cedric </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornberry </PERSON>, second-in-command of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring force in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, said only that `` substantial numbers'' of guerrillas have left northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since Wednesday. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has suggested the timetable for the entire <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace plan could be affected if it can not verify that all guerrillas have withdrawn after an ill-fated incursion that threatened to derail <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition to independence. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heerden </PERSON> said between 850 and 1,000 guerrillas of the <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peope </LOCATION>'s Organization have returned to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> on orders of their exiled leaders. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which has agreed to end its 74-year rule over <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, says about 1,600 guerrillas infiltrated from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> starting April 1, and that 305 guerrillas and 27 security forces were killed in fighting after that. Under a regional peace plan signed last year by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, the guerrillas were to remain at thir bases in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> until mid-May, when they were to return unarmed. The guerrilla organization is not a signatory to the agreement and denies it violated the accord. To encourage the guerrillas' withdrawal, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has confined its forces in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to their bases for a 60-hour period ending at dawn Saturday. South African, Angolan and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> negotiators, meeting in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet observers, agreed Friday to a 14-day verification period starting Saturday. During this period, South African and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials will try to confirm that all <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas have moved at least 100 miles inside <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. If a full <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> pullout is verified, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heerden </PERSON> said, South African forces will return to their bases May 13 and efforts will be made to resume the transition without delays to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> timetable calling for elections in November. A <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> statement Thursday said 1,337 guerrillas had `` redeployed'' from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. It did not specify the period during which the withdrawal occurred, nor say how many guerrillas remain in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> said its guerrillas `` have been running the gauntlet of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> troops' ambushes.'' All guerrillas in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> soon will move to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, provided security forces `` do not impede their way,'' it said. The independence plan is part of an agreement that also calls for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to withdraw 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where they have supported the Marxist government's fight against right-wing rebels backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

 White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> warned on Friday that higher interest rates could `` scrunch down'' the economy. `` It is a consumer issue to be worried about interest rates,'' as well as tax increases and international trade, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> told a luncheon of Consumer Alert, a conservative group he once headed. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> claimed for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration the achievement of keeping the economic recovery going, saying: `` This economy is strong, it is robust, and it will continue to thrive as long as we do n't adopt policies to scrunch it down.'' `` Those policies,'' he added, `` include interest rates. Those of you who are wise consumers understand that when you go to buy a car or a house or anything that requires you as a consumer to pay over a long period of time, one of the most critical aspects of whether or not it's a good deal for you is the rate of interest you will have to pay on the purchase.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said that he does not want the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, an independent body, to concentrate so hard on fighting inflation that it tips the economy into a recession. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has strong influence over interest rates through its control of the money supply, largely exercised through purchases and sales of government bonds, through rates it charges for use of its funds, and through other regulations. Fed credit policies are made public only with a time lag. The policy-making Open Market Committee decided in February not to increase rates further for the moment, but two weeks after that meeting the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> raised by one-half percentage point to 7 percent the rate it charges member banks for funds. The most recent figures show the economy expanding at an annual rate of 3 percent during the first three months of the year, and inflation as measured by consumer prices increasing at an annual rate of 6.1 percent during the first quarter, the highest rate in two years. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said the budget agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would bring a deficit reduction of $ 65 billion to $ 75 billion, and economic growth if it continues at the current rate would add $ 85 billion a year to federal revenue next year and the year after without new taxes. `` Compare that to what alternatives that are being proposed. One of the alternatives is a gasoline tax -LRB- increase -RRB-,'' he said. `` I think you all remember what happened when we had significant increases in gasoline prices in the late'70s. Our economy was stifled. ... If you want to match what you can get out of growth with a gasoline tax that would inhibit growth, you would have to be looking at an 85-cent per gallon increase. `` I ca n't imagine anyone advocating such a policy and getting away with being called a consumerist, and yet there are those who are trying to do that.'' He did not say who he had in mind. `` As a consumer you certainly worry about having competitive products in the market, and it is a consumer issue to have a strong commitment to free trade that allows competitive products to come in here,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. `` And I think one of the most difficult consumer issues to deal with emotionally is the trade issue. Because sometimes the first reaction, the emotional reaction of exclusion, is not one in the best interests of consumer or the country,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report Suggests Arrangements May Help Drive Up Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government report on Friday suggested that financial arrangements between physicians and health care businesses to which they refer Medicare patients may be helping to drive up costs in the federal health insurance program. The report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>' inspector general found that one in seven <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> physicians has a financial interest in a health care business to which they refer their patients. It also found that patients of these physicians receive far more laboratory and other services than patients of physicians who have no financial arrangements with health care businesses. The report by Inspector General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> stopped short of saying that financial arrangements between physicians and laboratories and other health-related businesses lead to unnecessary testing and higher Medicare costs. `` While we have demonstrated an association rather than a causality, this finding ... is quite troubling,'' the report said. <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> recommends that the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> agency that oversees <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, require health-care providers billing the program to disclose the names of their physician owners and investors to the program. He also recommends that all claims submitted for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> payment contain the names of referring physicians. HHS is developing regulations that would limit referring-physicians' financial involvement in laboratories or clinics, and a bill introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would generally prohibit physicians from referring <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients to health care businesses in which they hold a financial interest. Rep. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, D-Calif., who introduced the legislation, said Friday in a statement that `` Medicare, patients, and the taxpayer are paying tens of millons of dollars for needless tests, caused by doctors referring patients to centers from which the doctor makes a profit because of the referral. `` If we do not stop this practice, and if it continues to spread, the added cost to <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and the American health care system will be billions of dollars per year,'' <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> said. While many joint venture arrangements in the health-care industry are legitimate, <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON>'s office is distributing 1.2 million copies of a fraud alert to the nation's health care providers warning that certain arrangements violate the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid anti-kickback law. The report found that about 15 percent of physicians who bill <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> have an ownership, investment or compensation arrangement with health care businesses to which they refer patients. It estimated that 12 percent of physicians who bill <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> have ownership or investment interests in health care businesses, including testing laboratories, to which they refer patients. Eight percent of Medicare physicians have compensation arrangements with such businesses, including space rental and consulting agreements and management services contracts. Discounting the overlap between the two groups, about 15 percent have at least one or both types of financial interest. Also, at least 25 percent of independent clinical laboratories and 27 percent of independent physiological laboratories are owned wholly or partly by referring physicians, the report found. In addition, the report said that patients referred by physicians who own or invest in clinical laboratories received 45 percent more clinical lab services than all Medicare patients in general, regardless of where they received the services. This increased use of services cost the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> program $ 28 million in 1987, the report said. `` Certainly the utilization effect we have seen in the laboratory industries is cause for concern to the Medicare program,'' the report said. The inspector general's office compiled its findings through surveys of about 3,680 physicians and 1,132 health care businesses as well as interviews with industry representatives and health care experts.

<HEAD>Rare Ancient Fish Fossils Stolen From Bradley University</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two priceless fish fossils, estimated to be 300 million years old, are missing from a <ORGANIZATION> Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> display case and officials said Friday they may have been stolen for a private collector. <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, chairman of the geological sciences department at <LOCATION> Bradley </LOCATION>, said he discovered the theft Tuesday. Police are investigating. `` We use them for educational purposes so we do n't want to keep them locked away in a vault,'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. Stolen were the remains of a `` jawless fish'' related to the lamprey family, and the remains of a bony, ray-finned fish. The two fossils were imbedded on four small pieces of rock. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said they were the rarest and most valuable specimens in <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s collection, which numbers in the hundreds of thousands of fossils. Jawless fish were prehistoric ancestors of contemporary fish and are thought to have evolved from sand-dwelling filter feeders about 450 million years ago, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. A similar jawless fish fossil was stolen from the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> about 10 years ago, he said. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> theft appeared to be the work of experts who pried open a jewelry-type glass display case. `` This was not your normal snatch thief,'' he said. `` To the average thief in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, these fossils are worthless. These were stolen by someone who really knows fossils well.'' <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinertsen </PERSON>, senior staff geologist for the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION>, said collectors often buy and sell fossils through ads in mineral supply catalogs. `` There's a market for it,'' <PERSON> Reinertsen </PERSON> said. `` But if it's that rare, I suspect -LRB- it -RRB- was snagged for a private collection.''

 A court convicted 14 English soccer fans of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced them to three years in jail Friday for taking part in the 1985 <LOCATION> Heysel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> riot that killed 39 spectators. Eleven other fans were acquitted. A Belgian police officer and the former head of the Belgian soccer federation were convicted of charges stemming from the tragedy but received suspended sentences. The soccer disaster, in which fans from <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> were blamed for the deaths of mainly <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> fans, led to a ban on <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s private soccer clubs in European competition <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s national clubs were allowed to continue playing. Judge <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Verlynde </PERSON>, a member of the three-judge panel that rendered the verdicts, said the <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> fans `` transformed the field into a battleground'' and were `` thirsty for violence.'' The verdicts came in the wake of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s worst sports disaster. On April 15, 95 people were killed in a stadium stampede when fans tried to crowd into a standing-room only section during a match between <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Nottingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` It's just been a mess,'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodray </PERSON>, one of the 14 convicted <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> fans, said after Friday's verdict. `` I'm not looking forward to going to prison, but I'll be all right.'' The court suspended 1 -LCB- years of each three-year sentence. Public Prosecutor <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Erauw </PERSON> did not order arrests after the verdicts were issued, and many of the convicted fans returned to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> after the eight-hour hearing. `` They will receive an invitation to come to prison. If they say ` no,' we may have to bring them here one way or the other,'' he said. The 14 fans also were fined $ 1,538 each. <PERSON> Verlynde </PERSON> said the 11 other <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> fans were acquitted because of insufficient evidence. Convicted of negligence in the disaster was <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosens </PERSON>, former chairman of the Belgian soccer federation. His six-month sentence was suspended. <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> police officer <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahieu </PERSON> was convicted of gross omission of duty and his sentence, for nine months, also was suspended. Belgian police officer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kensier </PERSON> was acquitted. In a separate civil action brought by family members and heard by the same judicial panel that heard the criminal case, four officials were found not liable for the deaths that resulted from the tragedy. They included <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Georges </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s ruling soccer body; former organization General Secetary <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON>; <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Herve </PERSON> <PERSON> Brouhon </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Viviane </PERSON> <PERSON> Baro </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> alderman for sports. Damages ranging from $ 900 to several thousand dollars were awarded to individual plaintiffs in the civil action, and judges said there somehow would be provisions made for those convicted in the criminal actions to compensate the successful plaintiffs in the civil action. In addition to the 39 deaths, more than 500 people were injured when <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> fans rioted at <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heysel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> just prior to 1985 <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> soccer championship final between <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Juventus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turin </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Eighteen days earlier, 56 soccer fans had died in a fire at <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION> stadium. Belgian authorities had requested the extradition of 27 Britons based on videotapes and pictures showing <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> fans tearing down the flimsy fence separating them from Italian supporters. Two of the Britons already were jailed on unrelated charges, bringing the number extradited to 25. The invasion of the stands caused a panic during which victims were trampled to death as they tried to flee. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> complied with the extradition request in September 1987, and the five-month trial began Oct. 17, 1988. Closing arguments ended March 20. British defense lawyer <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON> said Belgian authorities may have to go through a second extradition process because authorities allowed the <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> fans to leave the country. <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON> said he expects those convicted to serve less than a year in jail. All the English defendants already served about six months in custody following their extraditions but were freed on their own recognizance prior to the trial. After the Heysel riots, English club teams were banned from European competition by <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION>. The organization announced last month it would lift the ban in time for the 1990-91 season provided English fans behaved at home until then.

 A 5-year-old girl whose hand was mutilated in a pipe bomb explosion at a K mart store last week was glad to be home Friday and the family was anxious to `` get on with our lives.'' `` She's doing very well,'' <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bower </PERSON> said shortly after her daughter, <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>, was released from <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` She wants to be home. She was getting restless.'' <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> was injured April 17 when a pipe bomb concealed in a pump-style toothpaste container exploded as she picked it up off the store's shelf. Surgeons could not salvage her maimed left hand, which was amputated the day after the explosion. On Tuesday, the lens was removed from the child's left eye, which also was hit in the blast. Doctors hope some sight will be regained in the eye. `` I'm just glad we have our little girl,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bower </PERSON> said. `` She does n't have a hand, but she's ours and she's got her same personality back. She's going to be fine. I've just got to keep telling myself that. We've got to get on with our lives.'' <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> was expected to spend the week resting at home before returning to her kindergarten classes. Meanwhile, more than 20 investigators working on the case continued to track down leads. In Terre Haute, two men matching the descriptions of those sought for questioning were interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>. The two were released later after questioning. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> bureau, said the two were not suspects. `` We're just continuing the investigation in our normal manner,'' said <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>. `` We're just out hitting the pavement, following up what leads we have and trying to find new ones.''

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> trial jury began its second week of deliberations Friday, yielding no signal on its progress: no notes, no words to the judge and no requests for clarifications or to rehear testimony. After working for five hours _ for a total 37 -LCB- since deliberations started _ the jurors told a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal they intended to come in Saturday for a half-day session, the same as last week. The jurors' weekday schedule has not varied. It begins with their arrival from a downtown hotel at 8:20 a.m., then juice and pastry and a 9 a.m. start. At noon a caterer arrives with lunches chosen individually by each juror from a menu. On Friday, the order got mixed up _ the caterer delivered the wrong lunches _ and the jurors went back to work until 12:30 when the right food arrived. <PERSON> North </PERSON> took advantage of the jury's 9-to-4 pace on Thursday with a quick trip to deliver a speech to the Bankers Club of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, presumably for the same $ 20,000 - $ 25,000 fee he has received for other recent appearances The former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide spoke about traditional values and received a standing ovation, according to <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> members who heard his speech. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sophomore from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> North </PERSON> spoke highly of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the club's next scheduled guest, booked for September. Protesters picketed outside the club before the speech. `` We do n't care whether <PERSON> North </PERSON> sees us or not,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, organizer for the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're demonstrating against the Bankers -LRB- Club -RRB- for giving him $ 25,000 while there are homeless people in this city sleeping on the streets. The <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> did not disclose <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s fee. `` You're all a bunch of pro-communists'' shouted a well-dressed businessman at the demonstrators. The North jury has before it 12 criminal charges, most of which accuse North of lying or withholding information about his and the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>'s support for the guerrillas fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government. North is accused of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cover up his role in secretly assisting the Contras and lying to the attorney general about aspects of the diversion of funds to the Contras from the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales. He also faces charges that he accepted a $ 13,800 home security system and converted $ 4,300 in traveler's checks from a Contra leader to his own use. Meanwhile, a two-judge panel of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> rejected a petition by 10 news organizations for access to a stipulation presented to the jury at the end of the trial, but not made available to the public. The appeals court sent the issue back to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> for a hearing on national security issues involved, saying it can not make a decision without having such a record. The stipulation summarizes highly secret intelligence intercepts about a November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that was assisted by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. North's lawyers referred in closing arguments to the stipulation in an effort to show that knowledge about the operatiion was not limited to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> but was known widely among top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials.

<HEAD>Pope Visits Madagascar Amid Truce; Says Ready to Meet Gorbachev</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> said Friday at the start of an African tour that he would welcome a meeting with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> when the Soviet leader visits <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in November. It would be the first meeting betweeen a pope and a Soviet Communist party chief. But the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said obstacles block a first papal visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, including the repression of Ukrainian Catholics who form the largest underground church in that country. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was speaking to reporters on his way to <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, where he kissed the earth of this divided island nation on his arrival amid a `` papal truce'' called after six days of anti-government riots claimed six lives. Standing together on the runway to greet him were President <PERSON> Didier </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON> and Archibishop <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Razafimahatratra </PERSON>, whose clergy includes strident critics of the Madagascan leader. But the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> saved his displeasure for the problem of the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, brutally suppressed in 1946 when dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> ordered it absorbed into the Russian Orthodox Church. Today Ukrainian Catholics make up the largest underground church in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` This is really a very difficult problem,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said of the issue still being discussed with Soviet Orthodox Church leaders. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> often has expressed a desire to visit his flock in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and some church officials hope a meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could pave the way for it. `` Naturally I am always willing to receive who ever asks for a meeting with me,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said in Italian. `` I would meet him -LRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB- with great respect as the head of state, the head of a system. `` Then, as far as this could be linked to the visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, that is something else because that is a church matter.'' On his arrival in <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, the pope noted the severe economic difficulties facing the island as they do most African nations. `` The bishops of this country are working with all their brothers, with determination, for national recovery,'' he said. <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> is the first stop on a trip that also is to take the pope to the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island of Reunion, and to <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>. Like many African countries, <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON> has abandoned socialist policies to gain Western aid and improve a moribund economy. At the same time he has moved to mend fences with the church. In his welcoming remarks, the Madagascan leader wasted no time trying to turn the visit to political advantage and accused his opponents of `` anarchy and political bad faith.'' Opposition parties, which claim electoral fraud in the March 12 presidential elections, urged a pause in the street violence, and the Federation of <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> Churches, which supports the opposition fraud claims, also appealed for tranquility during the papal visit. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is a member of the church group and some of its clergy may be victims of retaliation for their outspoken criticism of <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON>'s government. `` In 1988, four separate murders of clergymen again raised speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, whose officials often speak out on controversial issues, is being targeted by unknown political groups to silence church criticism,'' says the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report on human rights in <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> Opposition forces accuse the government of rigging the election which <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON> won by 63 percent of the vote. However, Western diplomats say the irregularities likely did not significantly affect the outcome. The opposition called for a national strike which failed to materialize, but riots erupted in the capital, killing at least six and injuring more than 70 in the past week. <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON>'s party and the opposition have accused each other of instigating the riots in this former French colony where about 40 percent of the population is Christian and the rest animist. Half the Christians are <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Former Administrator Calls Investigative Report Misleading</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The former administrator of a federal housing program faulted for mismanagement and favoritism defended his actions Friday and said an agency investigative report was misleading. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, former assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> and former federal housing commissioner, acknowledged documentation was lacking from the process that awarded <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> contracts for rehabilitation of low-income housing projects. But <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> said no favoritism was used to select winners, and that he and then-Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> instituted more formal and documented procedures for awarding contracts beginning this year, shortly before both left the department. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, meanwhile, told a group of state legislators Friday that the program `` was being abused by consultants and some folks who were making a phone call and getting a federal grant.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> shut down the program temporarily this week following release of an investigative report by the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> inspector general and blocked some $ 100 million in pending contracts, subject to a new review of the program. The report charged no criminal activity, but the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> inspector general turned it over to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for review. The report described how former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration figures, including former top <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials, and other Republicans collected big fees as consultants and in some cases became developers on projects to rehabilitate subsidized apartments for the poor. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said the report showed the program's selections were `` based on the perception and reality of favoritism and abuse of non-public information.'' <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, in a telephone interview, said the large number of former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials revealed to be involved in projects as developers or consultants after leaving government could be explained because they had developed special knowledge in a narrow, highly technical program. `` If they won those contracts, it was n't because of inside information,'' <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> handled applications for contracts under the program and was a member of a three-person selection committee that awarded winning projects. The investigative report by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> questioned the role of <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, who was responsible for the program beginning in October 1986. It said a non-profit charity, FOOD for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> headed before joining <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, received $ 290,000 from individuals and firms involved with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs administered by <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> said there was no connection between the charity and his administration of the program. He said $ 50,000 of the contributions came before he assumed responsibility for the program. And he charged the inspector general had included contributions from people and companies involved in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs other than the renovation program. `` It is a totally inappropriate presentation of facts,'' <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> said. `` It's unconscionable the way he's tried to mix apples and oranges and call them something else. ... What's the point except to mislead?'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> declined to respond to <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>'s comments. `` The report speaks for itself,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary throughout the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, did not return a reporter's call.

<HEAD>Trade Magazine Says Stealth Fighter Flying During Day</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, which last November acknowledged that it had been flying the stealth fighter at night for five years, has started operating the F-117A jets during the day, said a report published Friday. Aviation Week and Space Technology reported in its May 1 edition that over the past two weeks, as many as 20 stealth fighters have been spotted over <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, near <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Base. The weekly magazine published a grainy color photograph of an airborne F-117A, but it was far less detailed than a picture released by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> last November when it acknowledged the existence of the airplane for the first time. More than 50 of the swept-wing twin engine warplanes are stationed at the <LOCATION> Tonopah </LOCATION> Test Range Air Field in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. They are attached to the <ORGANIZATION> 4450th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Nellis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said in statement last Nov. 10. Capt. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Strednansky </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman at the Pentagon, said she had no information about daylight flights of the F-117A, but noted that the November announcement signaled that such operations were imminent. `` Daytime flights have been available to them since we released their existence,'' said <PERSON> Strednansky </PERSON>. `` If you fly it only at night, you can not integrate it into the rest of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>.'' Fifty-nine stealth fighters are being purchased from the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> at an undisclosed price, she said. Aviation Week, quoting unidentified residents of <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION>, said the fighters were flying what appeared to be training missions at 5:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. Local residents, many of whom are aerospace workers, say the F-117A makes an unsual noise, `` a distinctive, although faint, engine whine'' that the magazine said may be caused by an unusal design to the air intake. The stealth fighter, like the B-2 stealth bomber now under development, is triangular in shape and incorporates design features and material intended to make it all but invisible to enemy targeting radar. The trailing edge of the wings is sawtooth in shape, to avoid presenting right-angles to enemy radar, Aviation Week reported. When the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> disclosed the existence of the F-117A last November, it said the plane was first flown in June 1981 and had been in operation since 1983.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed an executive order Friday aimed at giving historically <PERSON> black </PERSON> colleges and universities greater federal assistance programs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> updated an existing order so that he could place a presidential board of advisers on historically <PERSON> black </PERSON> colleges and universities in the Education Department. `` Your voices must and will be heard,'' the president told several dozen black educators gathered in the White House Rose Garden to witness the signing ceremony. `` For over a hundred years,'' he said, `` the historically <PERSON> black </PERSON> colleges and universities have been a special part of our heritage. At a time when many schools barred their doors to black Americans, these colleges offered the best _ and often the only _ opportunity for a higher education.'' `` And today, thank heavens, most of those barriers have been brought down by the law,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And yet, historically <PERSON> black </PERSON> colleges and universities still represent a vital component of American higher education, enriching a great tradition of educational choice and diversity in this country.'' Along with setting up the advisory board, the executive order directs federal agencies to increase opportunities for historically <PERSON> black </PERSON> educational institutions to take part in various federal programs and directs agencies to maximize opportunties for students of these institutions to get part-time and summer jobs. `` It does n't do much good to educate our young people if they ca n't get good jobs when they get out,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intends to go ahead with the controversial FSX fighter deal with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> after reaching agreement with <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on conditions to safeguard sensitive technology and guarantee a share of production for American companies, congressional sources said Friday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was scheduled to make a formal announcement in the White House briefing room before the end of the day. The project is controversial because critics say it would give <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aviation technology to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and hurt <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s competitive advantage. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had deliberated for many weeks on the proposed deal for joint U.S.-Japanese production of the new fighter plane, an advanced version of the U.S.-built F-16. The plane would be built by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. The president had said previously he wanted to go ahead with the joint venture as long as the agreement would safeguard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have 30 days to review the agreement before it is finalized. The deal was complicated this week by Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noburu </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s announcement that he would resign because of the influence peddling scandal that has paralyzed his government. Congressional sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified, said the Japanese government had agreed to ensure that 40 percent of the estimated $ 5 billion production run on the plane will be handled in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Japanese had already agreed to give <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies a 40 percent share of the FSX's estimated $ 1.2 billion development work. On another key point, the congressional sources said, the Japanese agreed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> requests for protection of sensitive source codes used for computers aboard the plane. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration negotiated the arrangement initially after <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> refused to buy any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 fighters and indicated it would build its own fighter plane. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last month that he would send <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a modified version of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration agreement. Sources have said that among the assurances <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were insisting on were an expanded role for the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to monitor the project and keep track of Japanese compliance. Reports from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> earlier Friday said the agreement was near on the project as the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> decided to retract its demand that more than 50 percent of engine production work be given to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> receive all computer software for flight control of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16, which is the basis for the FSX jet. Backers of the venture say the project is a way to add fighters to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s inventory in strategic northeast <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s expense It also would provide jobs for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and give <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> access to sophisticated radar technology developed by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Under the FSX arrangement, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> is to join forces with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> to develop and manufacture the next-generation fighter for deployment by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the late 1990s. Proponents have argued that the agreement represents the best deal the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could negotiate in the face of Japanese opposition to buying F-16s directly from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They say the deal will serve to promote beneficial technology transfer in both directions while generating income and jobs for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry. Critics, however, contend that the arrangement amounts to a giveaway of advanced technology that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> may use to help propel the its civilian aircraft industry into head-to-head competition with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the world market. They say <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> should purchase American-made planes to help offset the $ 50 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. In the face of congressional opposition, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration conducted an interagency review culminating in heated Cabinet-level meetings that pitted the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative against the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which had negotiated the FSX deal. As a result of these meetings, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought `` clarifications'' from the Japanese to help safeguard sensitive technology and ensure a share of the plane's production for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry.

 A woman who sued a liquor company over her son's birth defects testified Friday that she drank herself unconscious several times during her pregnancy, but never was warned that alcohol would hurt her baby <PERSON> Candance </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON>, 39, an admitted alcoholic, said under cross examination that she drank heavily during the 1984 pregnancy, even though she had previously been in alcohol treatment programs. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauber </PERSON>, an attorney for defendant <ORGANIZATION> Jim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, asked Mrs. <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON> whether she drank herself into unconsciousness every night of the pregnancy. `` At times I did,'' she said. `` A lot of times I did not.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> are seeking to force <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> to pay for lifetime care of their 4-year-old son <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, who is mentally retarded and has other birth defects in a pattern known as fetal alcohol syndrome. They have maintained they would have stopped drinking if they had known if could harm the unborn baby. They claim <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> knew of a link between alcohol consumption and birth defects, and was negligent by failing to put warning labels on its products. Attorneys have said the trial is apparently the first in which damages are sought from an alcohol company for FAS. The company has denied a link between alcohol and birth defects, but also says any problems that may have been caused by alcohol in <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON>'s case were due to Mrs. <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON>'s own negligence. Mrs. <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON> testified that no doctor ever told her about the dangers of drinking while pregnant, even though she had been in several alcohol treatment programs and had two previous children. Under prodding from her attorney, <PERSON> Kandice </PERSON> <PERSON> Tezak </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON> also noted <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s birth defects on a large color picture displayed to the jury. She noted the child's small nose, thin lips and lack of indentation above the lip, and also said he had a short attention span, poor coordination and was not toilet-trained. `` If I knew it would cause the birth defects it has I would n't have drunk,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON> said, adding that she occasionally read the label on bottles of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> liquor and that there were no warnings against consumption by pregnant women If there had been such a warning she would have stopped drinking while pregnant, she said. Under cross-examination before the packed courtroom of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimmick </PERSON>, a pattern emerged of continuous drinking in the Thorp household before, during and after the pregnancy. Mrs. <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON> admitted that while pregnant she sometimes drank liquor with her husband in the morning before he went to work, during the day while she did housework, and in the evenings. Mrs. <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON> testified that in all her pregnancies she was advised to rest, exercise and eat well, but never was specifically told that drinking could harm a fetus. She admitted drinking up to half a fifth of whiskey per day before giving birth on Dec. 28, 1984. FAS was first identified in this country in the early 1970s by a team of <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> researchers. An estimated 30,000 children are born in this country each year with FAS, according to a 1982 study.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Dismissal Of Islanders Claim About Nuclear Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A three-member federal appeals court panel Friday upheld the dismissal of suits by <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION> claiming damages from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear tests. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has stripped the courts of jurisdiction over these claims,'' declared the appeals court opinion by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sentelle </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> ruled on June 16, 1987 that federal courts have no jurisdiction to assess the validity of an agreement giving the government of the <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> authority to press claims of citizens for damages from the atomic tests between 1946 and 1958. The <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1986 signed a <ORGANIZATION> Compact </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> giving the islands self-government status. A federal law was passed endorsing the compact. Under the independence settlement, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islands </ORGANIZATION> goverment $ 150 million to pay people claiming damages from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear tests in the 1940s and 1950s. The plaintiffs claim that sum is insufficient and are attempting to sue for more. On Aug. 22, 1983, while the compact and settlement were being negotiated, some 3,000 island residents directly downwind from the nuclear test sites filed suit in federal court. They sought damages for personal injuries and death resulting from their exposure to dangerous levels of radiation. Attorneys for the islanders had argued that the compact was invalid and that technically the islands are still a territory of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, under whose stewardship they operated for some 40 years. All three judges on the appeals panel affirmed the lower court ruling. However, <PERSON> Sentelle </PERSON> was alone in his conclusion that the challenge by the islanders raises a political question that was unreviewable by the courts. `` While the treaty power of the executive expressly involves the participation of the legislature, no where does the constitution contemplate the participation by the third, non-political branch, that is the judiciary,'' said <PERSON> Sentelle </PERSON>. Judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> did n't concur with that section of <PERSON> Sentelle </PERSON>'s decision, saying the matter is an unreviewable political question. Chief Judge <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> wrote a separate opinion. <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> argued that the <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> controversy falls outside the political question doctrine on the basis of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s consideration of questions with potentially substantial impact on foreign relations She also said: `` I am troubled by the majority's uncritical assumption that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may deprive a narrow class of plaintiffs of judicial relief, even if their claims are nonconstitutional.'' <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> said the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of the compact and the `` espousal'' section settling nuclear testing claims `` were consistently thought of as parts of a package. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not seriously consider enacting one without the other.'' She said that she believes <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended that withdrawing jurisdiction should be contingent on court approval of the espousal mechanism settling nuclear testing claims. She found that mechanism valid, saying: `` I do not believe ... that international law in any way forbids the agreement reached here.''

<HEAD>Williams, Former Teamsters Chief, Dies Seven Months After Prison
Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEETON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who rose from trucker to international Teamsters president, died at his farm home Friday, seven months after his release from a prison term for conspiring to bribe a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator. He was 74. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had been in poor health for years with emphysema and an enlarged heart and died just hours after a doctor was called to the house. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a protege of former Teamster President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON>, served as president from 1981-83. He was forced to resign the presidency to delay the start of a 10-year sentence following his conviction with four other men for attempting to bribe then-Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> to influence trucking deregulation <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who now holds positions once held by <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> as president of <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> 56 and Local 41 in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, praised his former boss. `` <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was the best thing to happen to the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> outside of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said Friday. `` There's been a lot of bad publicity about him, and maybe some of it rightly so. But he went to jail for trying to keep out deregulation, which has eliminated over 160,000 Teamster jobs.'' `` You could n't ask for a better man, as a Teamster, as someone that cared about his members, and as a leader of that movement,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. There was no immediate reaction to <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' death from the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, current union president, made it clear earlier this month in testimony before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he was no fan of <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> or <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON>, who disappeared in 1975 and is presumed dead. `` One was a cheat and one was a liar and both were mixed up with <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nostra </ORGANIZATION> by their own admissions. I did n't care for either one of them,'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> testified at a casino skimming trial in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that he had been on the payroll of the mob and under the domination of <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Civella </PERSON>, the late <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> crime boss. He said he received $ 1,500 a month from late 1974, when he was a local Teamster president, until mid-1981 when he was elected international vice president. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' testimony in that trial and other racketeering cases was designed to get his sentence _ originally set at 55 years _ reduced and to get him out of prison early. He continued to cooperate with the government after his release last September from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> always maintained his innocence and said he was set up in the bribery case. He also claimed that he cooperated with the mob after the lives of his family members had been threatened by <PERSON> Civella </PERSON>'s henchmen. `` I am still just an old truck driver at heart,'' he said in a January interview. `` It's over now, and I am glad of it. I still have to meet my maker. But I can still say I did n't do nothing wrong.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' physician, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON>, said the former labor leader died of complications of emphysema a few hours after he refused to leave the house to go to the hospital. <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> was called to the house about 5:30 a.m. Friday when <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had difficulty breathing. `` He was a little worse than usual, but he did seem to improve,'' <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> said. `` He'd had several spells before, and he did not want to go to the hospital.'' <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> said he was called back about three hours later after <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' condition worsened. Paramedics were not able to revive him. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is survived by two daughters and a grandson.

<HEAD>Law Protects Against Fake Mileage On Used Cars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new federal regulation goes into effect Saturday aimed at protecting consumers from used car sellers who change the odometer readings on cars. The rule implementing the 1986 Truth in Mileage Act requires that records be kept of automobile mileage and is intended to make it possible for a would-be buyer to trace the actual mileage of a vehicle. Although waivers have been given in several states that have said they need more time to change forms, the law requires that motor vehicle titles issued after Saturday must be printed so that counterfeiting and alterations can easily be detected. It also requires that mileage readings be disclosed on the title whenever the car is sold. If the title does not have a space for the odometer reading, a separate disclosure statement is required. Used car dealers, leasing companies and auto auctions must maintain records, including the mileage of vehicles sold, for at least five years. Federal laws prohibit tampering with odometers. In 1987, the latest year for which the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has a complete report, 17 cases of large-scale odometer fraud were sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and five others to state enforcement agencies. Some of the cases led to civil action, and eight federal grand jury indictments led to 14 criminal convictions, said agency spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s announcement Friday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intends to go ahead with plans to produce the FSX fighter plane with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> I'm pleased to announce that the governments of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have reached understandings that will allow us to proceed with joint development of the FSX fighter aircraft. I'm ready to submit the FSX agreement to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for its review. We've been conducting talks with the Japanese to clarify both sides' understanding to this agreement. I'm convinced that the co-development of this aircraft is in the strategic and commercial interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And we weighed this matter from the standpoint of trade, of our industrial growth, and technology transfer, as well as strategic and foreign policy considerations. This aircraft will improve the basic F-16 design and will contribute to the security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and our major ally, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. There will be no cost to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayer. And, at the same time, the Japanese will improve their ability to carry their share of the defense burden. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> will have a 40 percent work share in the initial development stage of this aircraft. And we will have a similar share when the aircraft goes into production. We did have several initial concerns about the agreement. But I want to assure you that sensitive source codes for the aircraft's computer will be strictly controlled. Access will be granted to only those codes that are essential to complete the project. In conclusion, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the world's leader in aircraft manufacturing. I believe this aircraft will improve the defense of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. And this agreement also helps preserve our commitment that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aerospace products of the future will continue to dominate the world markets. That's the end of the statement. Thank you all very much.

<HEAD>Criticism of Governing Party Increases With Budget Passage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN MOFFAT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Criticism of the governing party, already wracked by a bribery scandal, increased Friday after it forced the 1989 budget through Parliament's lower house without opposition participation for the first time in postwar history. The opposition condemned the move, and for the first time in nine years more Japanese said they supported the opposition parties than the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, according to a newspaper poll. In 35 years of unbroken rule, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> had never completely ignored the opposition in voting on the budget, even though they hold an overwhelming majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The $ 455 billion budget was subject to only two days of public debate in February. According to the constitution, the budget now goes to the upper house for approval, but it will be implemented on May 27 if that assembly fails to pass it. The opposition had stalled budget deliberations since February by boycotting parliamentary sessions to press their demand that former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> testify about his links to <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a business and publishing conglomerate at the center of the bribery and stock-profiteering scandal. The government has been operating on an interim budget since April 1. With the government unable to issue bonds or authorize new public works projects, analysts said business confidence was in danger of falling. This may have helped prompt the move by the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has close ties with big business, analysts said. On Tuesday, Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced he would resign after the budget is approved to take responsibility for the Recruit scandal, which has brought sharp public criticism of his administration and his party. Japanese political tradition holds that the governing party should provide an opportunity for opposition parties to participate in parliamentary debate and vote even if they comprise only a minority. Opposition politicians blocked a hallway leading to the lower house in an attempt to prevent the vote on the budget, but guards pushed them aside to get Speaker <PERSON> Kenzaburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hara </PERSON> into the 512-seat chamber. One independent lawmaker voted against the budget, which passed by a 281-1 margin. The party's budget action was `` an outrage unprecedented since the end of World War II ... and a serious challenge to the people,'' said <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition group. The deputy speaker of the house, a former <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION>, said he would resign his post, while an upper house lawmaker from a minor opposition party said he would quit Parliament to protest the governing party's move. Four Liberal Democrats also boycotted the vote in protest against their party's action, while 11 members were absent. In a survey conducted by the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, 44 percent of 2,403 respondents said they supported one of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s five main opposition parties or other minor parties, while 42 percent said they supported the Liberal Democrats. The poll was taken immediately after <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced his plans to resign and was to appear in the newspaper's Saturday editions. An <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> editorial Saturday called for the dissolution of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for new elections and a `` radical reform of politics in our country.'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> is to leave Saturday for a week-long trip to <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and is expected to step down after his return. News reports continued to speculate on who would be his successor, with many analysts expecting that former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, 75, would eventually accept the post although he has so far refused suggestions that he take the job. In the scandal, Recruit sold unlisted stocks at low prices to about 160 prominent people, including politicians and businessmen. Many of the recipients sold their shares after they were listed publicly and rose sharply in value. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has admitted receiving more than $ 1 million in political donations from Recruit in 1985-87. Before attending the budget session, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> attended the funeral of <PERSON> Ihei </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>, his top aide and fund controller, who committed suicide Wednesday. <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> had purchased Recruit shares and used the profits to finance <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s political expenses. The prime minister's announcement Tuesday that he would resign apparently prompted <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> to hang himself

He will succeed <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>, who is leaving the foreign service to join a consulting firm operated by former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>. The appointment of <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, which requires <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation, symbolizes the rise through diplomatic ranks of a new breed of foreign service officer outside the traditional mold of white Ivy Leaguers. The proportion of women and blacks has been on the rise for several years. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> served in the Far East and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Near </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and South Asian bureau.

The job of director-general will put him in charge of all personnel activities in the department and in the foreign service worldwide. This includes recruiting, hiring, assignments, promotion and discharge. He will report directly to Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Vest, who has served for 49 years, including World War II military duty, calls it `` a wonderful job.'' `` I deal with every human problem there is,'' he said in a brief interview.

Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, the permanent representative, rejected the allegations and said, `` The moral bankruptcy of the regime of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for which Mr. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> speaks is well known.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is armed forces chief and as such, de facto leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s government of blatantly interfering in the election process; manipulating voters' lists; muzzling the opposition, press and TV, and restricting access by impartial foreign monitors and journalists. The meeting was adjourned after the Panamanian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> speeches. No action was taken and no further meeting was scheduled. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has supplied millions of dollars to opposition candidates opposing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and has sent commandos, special weapons and helicopters to that Central American nation right before elections May 7. He accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of trying to subvert democratic elections, set up a puppet, pro-Washington government and undermine the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Treaty. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plans of interfering in the Panamanian electoral process have entered a phase of direct participation,'' <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> told the 15-member council. `` The objective is undermining public order, causing chaos, promoting widespread destabilization in the country around election time and creating a pretext for military intervention in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention was jeopardizing regional peace and security. In February 1988, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted on federal drug charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. He denied the charges. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, trying to force out <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> also complained that <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> did not address the specific complaint that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was sending special arms and making non-defensive military preparations in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as a prelude to using force. He referred to a statement Thursday by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who said the Noriega-controlled government is committing systematic fraud and is employing violence and coercion to intimidate <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> citizens who believe in democracy. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said, `` We are discussing <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> before the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> because the regime will not permit a free and open debate to take place among the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people. The solution to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s lack of democracy does not lie here in the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, but in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s crisis stemmed not from any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plot to interfere, but from `` the policies of Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who has arrogated to himself complete power over civic life and sponsored and countenanced widescale corruption, drug trafficking and gun-running.'' The ambassador said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has grave doubts about the honesty of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s election process. The human rights commission of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> also expressed concern about `` extensive irregularities'' interfering in free elections, <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said Friday that through `` manipulation and intimidation the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime is making it extremely difficult for international observers to perform their functions. `` We hope that despite the many roadblocks which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is putting in their way, observers will go to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to see and tell the truth about what is going on there. She expressed hope that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will let former Presidents <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> monitor the elections there. Panamanian officials have said they would be welcome. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is backing <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> for president against <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> denied that his campaign received <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday touted his adherence to his `` no new taxes'' pledge for 1990 but conceded that `` we still have a ways to go'' to bring the deficit in line with mandated Gramm-Rudman targets for the following year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in comments to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` rough times lie ahead'' for his administration on the economy. He praised his budget agreement with congressional leaders for meeting the deficit-reduction target of the Gramm-Rudman law for the 1990 fiscal year. While the agreement has $ 5.3 billion in unspecified new revenues, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said those wo n't be new taxes. `` And I kept that ` no new taxes' pledge,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added. `` But we still have a ways to go because we've got to go move dramatically down in the next fiscal year to meet the Gramm-Rudman targets which I'm determined to do. And that does mean we have to have fiscal restraint in a lot of areas where, very candidly, I wish we could do more.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s no-new-taxes pledge was a campaign rallying cry that many critics say will be impossible to live up to for another year and still reduce the budget deficit below the ceiling set by the Gramm-Rudman legislation. Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked later if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was hinting that he might entertain some backing away from the no-taxes vow, said, `` I do n't interpret that as any hints of any changes.'' Asked whether the president might go along with congressional Democrats and approve tax increases a few months down the line, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was looking at all future budget decisions carefully, and that as the next Gramm-Rudman target approaches `` Clearly those decisions will be even tougher in terms of'91 and'92.'' `` We have brought the deficit down steadily from something like $ 212 billion to $ 150 -LRB- billion -RRB- and now to $ 100 -LRB- billion -RRB-, but it's clear that the last 100 is going to be very difficult. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, however, that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was vowing to keep his non-new-taxes pledge in 1990. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also reiterated that he will not `` cave in'' on his proposal to raise the minimum wage to $ 4.25 an hour and to tie it to a lower six-month training wage. Congressional negotiators are now working on a proposal to increase the minimum wage to $ 4.55 an hour with a more restrictive two-month training wage.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought an additional 1.05 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn for delivery this year under a long-term supply agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Officials said the latest corn sales by unidentified private exporters pushed the total grain bought by the Soviets this year to almost 18.3 million tons, close to the record 18.6 million tons <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> purchased from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1984-85. Corn makes up about 14.3 million tons and wheat 4 million. The corn is scheduled for delivery by Sept. 30, the end of the sixth year of a long-term grain supply agreement between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Additionally, the department said 1988-89 sales to the Soviets include about 450,000 tons of soybeans, 1.4 million tons of soybean meal, and 607,400 tons of grain sorghum. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 1.05 million tons of corn would be about 41 million bushels. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.53 per bushel at the farm level, according to the latest <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> five-day average, meaning that the latest sale could have a farm value of more than $ 100 million.

<TEXT>
 A cease-fire negotiated by the Arab League was strained by repeated violations Friday, threatening a renewal of the shelling duels between Lebanese Christian and Syrian troops that killed 273 people. The truce that ended 52 days of bombardments also was jeopardized by differences of interpretation over who controls the ports _ the issue that started the fighting. A police spokesman said Syrians and their Druse Moslem allies fired sporadic salvos of rockets at the Christian port of <LOCATION> Byblos </LOCATION> from about 1:30 p.m. to nightfall, but no casualties were reported. The cease-fire went into effect at noon Friday. The spokesman said the Christian gunners did not retaliate. `` Infractions are so far of a minor nature, but they could collapse the cease-fire if they continue or intensify,'' said the spokesman, who was not identified in line with regulations. He also said that at about 1:30 p.m., two howitzer shells fired from Syrian-controlled mountains southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> hit the Christian sector but caused no casualties. On Friday before the cease-fire began, Syrian troops and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militiamen intermittently fired howitzer and mortar rounds across the Green Line that divides the capital into Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, police reported. They said there were no casualties. During the 52 days of frequently heavy shelling at least 993 people were wounded. The truce was announced Thursday at the end of an emergency meeting of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> foreign ministers in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. The agreement provides for an unspecified number of Arab observers to monitor the cease-fire, thus loosening <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s grip as <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s main powerbroker. The cease-fire is the fourth attempt by the 22-nation <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> to halt the fighting. It was welcomed by the main parties to the conflict _ <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who had declared a `` war of liberation'' from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, called the truce `` the first step toward a broader pan-Arab role in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which would weaken <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s monopoly of the decision-making process in our country.'' In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>'s government said it is `` satisified with resolutions announced by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> initially sent its 40,000 troops into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1976 on a peacekeeping mandate from the league. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> supported the decision to send in Arab League observers. She added that outside parties involved in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> must exercise `` utmost restraint.'' Under questioning, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said that statement was a reference to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> would meet Saturday with the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee that drafted the plan. The meeting follows a statement by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> supporting the Arab League's peace efforts and urging that <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> `` make all possible efforts and ... contacts which could be deemed useful.'' The league truce calls for lifting the air, sea and land blockades imposed during the fighting. An earlier statement from <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Cabinet welcomed `` lifting of blockades imposed on legal ports besieged by the Syrian forces.'' It said maritime agencies should `` instruct their ships to head to legal ports.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> appears to be maintaining a blockade of ports run by Syrian-backed militias, a step likely to jeopardize the truce. Moslem army brigade commanders said the `` cease-fire and the lifting of blockades were a whole package agreement.'' The present confrontation broke out March 8, two days after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> ordered a blockade of militia-run ports that deny the state treasury $ 100 million a year in customs dues. Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s militia retaliated by shelling the 310-square-mile Christian enclave. Syrian gunners joined. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, the organ of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> party, voiced concern the truce is `` mere security tranquilizers.'' The Syrian-backed Moslem Cabinet of acting Premier <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, which competes with the <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> government in running <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, pledged `` full cooperation'' in the truce. It made no comment on <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s order Friday that <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> International Airport reopen. The country's only airport, located on the edge of Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, closed March 12 after Christian gunners targeted it. A source close to <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said the airport will stay closed until the Moslem Cabinet decides otherwise.

 A wildfire in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> burned 4,000 to 6,000 acres of the <ORGANIZATION> Osceola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, sending smoke 45 miles to <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, and 7,000 acres burned in a week-old fire in southeastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's still burning uncontained,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Enos </PERSON>, supervisor of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` We do n't expect any relief from the weather before Monday.'' Westerly winds carried the smoke and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> warned of dense smoke in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> over the weekend unless the fire is brought under control. <PERSON> Enos </PERSON> said the smoke was not blowing over major highways. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said 100 firefighters were fighting the blaze in <LOCATION> Pinhook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Swamp </LOCATION>, 23 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Enos </PERSON> said no structures have been damaged, and there have been no injuries. The origin of the fire, which began Thursday, was under investigation. It began on land adjacent to the forest owned by a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Container </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. High winds, low humidity and dry brush and trees hampered firefighters' efforts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Capt. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, regional forest ranger for the state <ORGANIZATION> Depatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paltz </LOCATION>, compared this spring's stubborn blazes in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rockland </LOCATION> counties to the vast fires that burned for much of last summer in the western <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said the presence of two superhighways in the region, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Thruway </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Palisades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Interstate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parkway </LOCATION>, have been key to preventing even more extensive burning. `` I think that if it had not been for the Parkway and the Thruway, these things just would have kept getting bigger and bigger,'' he said. `` It's just like out west, you do everything humanly possible and the fire does what it wants anyway.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinaldi </PERSON>, a DEC forest ranger in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paltz </LOCATION>, said the fire had burned about 3,000 acres of timber. `` The burning conditions are absolutely right, just incredible,'' <PERSON> Rinaldi </PERSON> said. `` We're not getting the humidity or the rain so everything is very dry. ... We're seeing fires that are jumping bulldozer lines, macadam roads _ it's beyond belief.''

 An Indian supertanker ran aground off the Saudi Arabian coast, and officials at <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said Friday that about 1.5 million gallons of oil leaked into the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The 276,744-ton <LOCATION> Kanchenjunga </LOCATION> had taken on 42 million gallons of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> crude oil from the <LOCATION> Yanbu </LOCATION> terminal near <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION> and was on its way to <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> when it ran aground Wednesday night. The vessel, owned by the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>, sustained some holes when it lodged on a reef about six miles from <LOCATION> Yanbu </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> said about 1.5 million gallons of oil had leaked into the Red Sea from the <LOCATION> Kanchenjunga </LOCATION>'s three damaged tanks, one on the port side and two on the starboard side. It said those tanks contained close to 8.4 million gallons of light crude. An oil slick was drifting out to sea, and pollution experts, who arrived on Thursday, were assessing the situation and had asked for salvage crews, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> said the grounding occurred at 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday. Authorities in the port of <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION> were also investigating the situation, it said. Shipping executives here said most of the oil would have to be pumped out before the ship can be refloated. They said another tanker would have to come alongside the <LOCATION> Kanchenjunga </LOCATION> and the oil pumped into it with the help of salvage tugboats. Earlier Wednesday, a Liberian-flag oil tanker was slightly damaged in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION> by an explosion caused by a drifting mine. The mines are left over from the Iran-Iraq war, which came to a halt in August with a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire.

 Senegalese angered by violence against their countrymen in neighboring <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> attacked Mauritanians in <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION> on Friday, killing at least 20 people, officials said. Authorities in <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, in an order broadcast by state radio, declared a state of emergency in the capital and a curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., to be in effect for at least six days. Under the state of emergency, all public and private gatherings are banned. The violence began this month in dispute over land near the border between the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> nations. Reports say more than 150 people have been killed. Several thousand Senegalese assembled Friday around the hospital at <LOCATION> Grand-Yoff </LOCATION> on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>, where survivors of the violence in <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> were being treated after being flown home. Police used tear gas to try to break up the mob, but the officials said on condition of anonymity that at least 20 Mauritanians were killed. President <PERSON> Abdou </PERSON> <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON> was among the Senegalese who visited the hospital, but reporters said he broke down in tears and cut short his visit. Among the 281 people being treated, some had their sex organs or limbs mutilated, and most of the corpses brought home had been decapitated, the reporters with the president said. Word of the nature of the injuries enraged the crowd, which then went seeking Mauritanians, many of whose homes and shops had been burned or looted this week. A few hundred Mauritanians were flown home to <LOCATION> Nouakchott </LOCATION> after the earlier violence, but many others had been gathered at the <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION> fairgrounds to await repatriation. Many of the angry Senegalese headed to the fairgrounds in search of vengeance. <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mokhtar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ould </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamel </PERSON>, said a An Air Mauritanie plane that arrived Friday afternoon to take about 80 people home was forced to leave more than half of them behind when Senegalese attacked the passengers. He said airport authorities urged the plane to take off without the others because its presence was considered a provocation. The French news agency Agence France-Presse quoted what it said was a good source in <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION> as saying Senegalese planes were denied permission to fly to <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> to pick up refugees, apparently in response to the airport incident in <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>. According to news reports in <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>, between 150 and 200 people, both Mauritanians and Senegalese, were killed by mobs on Monday and Tuesday in <LOCATION> Nouakchott </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nouadhibou </LOCATION>, the second largest city in <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>. The government in <LOCATION> Nouakchott </LOCATION> said it had no official casualty report, but a source in the capital's main public hospital said 26 people died there and 675 others were treated for injuries. Others may have died at other hospitals or clinics, he said. The government of <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> declared it has the right to respond by any measures necessary if it is established that Mauritanian forces were responsible for killing Senegalese. The violence was spawned by a land dispute along the river separating the countries. Two Senegalese, accused of farming illegally on Mauritanian land, were shot April 9. Sporadic attacks on Mauritanians in <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> blew up into widespread attacks, sparking retaliation.

 <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sendic </PERSON>, founder of the extreme left <ORGANIZATION> Tupamaros </ORGANIZATION> movement in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, died Friday in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where he was undergoing treatment for a neurological illness, officials at the <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rist </PERSON> clinic said.

Sendic organized strikes in the sugar cane fields and hunger marches in 1960-61, then changed to an urban guerrilla strategy with the founding in 1963 of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The front is called the MLN by its Spanish initials but is better known as the <ORGANIZATION> Tupamaros </ORGANIZATION>, after <ORGANIZATION> Tupac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amaru </ORGANIZATION>, an 18th-century Inca chief burned at the stake by the Spaniards. The Tupamaros raided food warehouses, redistributing their booty to the poor, and later moved into kidnappings for ransom to raise money. One such incident inspired the film `` State of Siege,'' by director <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gavras </LOCATION>, starring <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Montand </PERSON> as the American advisor to the Uruguayan police who was kidnapped and later killed. The MLN's first legal convention was held in December 1985, where delegates voted to abandon armed struggle in favor of non-violent political action, with a Marxist and nationalist program favoring labor and land reform. Sendic was wounded and captured by soldiers in September 1972. He was held without trial for 12 years, during which his family and human rights campaigners protested the conditions of his detention. He was convicted and sentenced to 45 years in prison in 1984, but released the following year.

 The Heinz company said Friday it will destroy its stocks of baby food in British stores and replace them with food in tamper-proof jars after extortionists contaminated the product. It said stocks removed from stores will be replaced in two to three weeks by jars enclosed in heat-sealed plastic sleeves. H.J. <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the British subsidiary of the Pittsburgh-based H.J <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, sells about 170 million jars of baby food a year in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> officials were unable to say immediately how many containers of baby food would have to be destroyed or to give a monetary value. Police investigating nearly 300 reports of contaminated baby food said two apparently were the work of one man demanding up to $ 1.7 million from <LOCATION> Heinz </LOCATION>. Detectives at <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION> police headquarters said they believe the vast majority of the incidents involved `` copycats, people getting on the bandwagon, cranks and some cases of self-contamination.'' Arrests have been reported in connection with hoaxes, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said. A 14-month-old boy, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Cookson </PERSON>, was the latest casualty of the potentially deadly campaign. He was hospitalized in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> with glass in his stomach after eating a jar of baby's yogurt that was found to contain glass. A doctor at <ORGANIZATION> Booths </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> was not at risk. In three earlier cases, two mothers cut their fingers on glass in baby food and a 9-month-old girl cut her mouth when she bit on a piece of razor blade in yogurt. The tampering reports began April 7. The news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said detectives believe the extortionists may have mastered a sophisticated technique of resealing jars. The small glass jars have metal lids with an indented center, which indicates the vacuum seal has not been broken. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON>, director of corporate affairs at <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, flew to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Thursday night. He said, `` We will never pay the blackmailers,'' when asked about <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> news reports that some unidentified companies had handed over a total $ 850,000 to extortionists. The reports have not been confirmed. <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON> pledged his company will do everything possible to catch those responsible. He described people lacing baby food with broken glass, thumbtacks, pins, needles, razor blade fragments and caustic soda as `` thugs and terrorists.'' `` I am absolutely outraged and disgusted. These people are attacking the most vulnerable sections of our society _ babies,'' <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON> said. Cow and <ORGANIZATION> Gate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a baby food manufacturer that shares 80 percent of the British market with <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, said it had received no demands. Most of the objects were found in <LOCATION> Heinz </LOCATION> or Cow and Gate products, but several were in other brands of baby food. A <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard statement said police believed the man who made the demands to <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> also tried to extort money from a pet food company last fall. Police refused to name the pet food company, but <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> television said Pedigree Petfoods paid $ 34,000 to stop the threats. It said the money was placed in a bank account. Earlier reports said most of the money then was withdrawn through bank machines and that police failed to catch the cuprits.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on Friday won a reprieve from a judge's order to release 1,200 semiautomatic rifles that had been impounded as part of a temporary ban on importing assault weapons. The 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> granted the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s request for a temporary stay of a lower court order that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> release the rifles impounded at the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, airport. The government had contended that the federal district judge's ruling Wednesday could undermine the import ban imposed last month following public outcry over increased use of assault weapons in drug killings The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the suit by an <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> gun dealer challenged `` actions taken by responsible officials to combat the growing epidemic of violent crime and to insure that the statute governing gun importation is properly enforced.'' The three-judge panel's ruling came about an hour after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> refused to stay his order, which was issued Wednesday in a lawsuit brought by the gun importer. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> last month temporarily suspended importation of up to 640,000 foreign-made weapons while it determined if the guns were being used for legitimate sporting purposes. The government's `` ability to protect the public during the review process would by definition be irreparably damaged if one of the very weapons under scrutiny is allowed to be imported'' and used to kill someone, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in court papers. <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to release 1,200 Steyr AUG-SA rifles made in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Gun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Trussville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, contended in its suit that the permit it obtained to import 5,200 Steyr rifles was approved before the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> ban took effect. Gun South, meanwhile, sought an order Friday from <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> that the government show cause why it should n't be held in contempt of the judge's order for refusing to turn over the guns on Thursday. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, the company's president, said in an affidavit that the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> office refused to give him the weapons. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said <PERSON> Eldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, the Customs official, told him he was under orders from superiors in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> not to release the guns despite the judge's order. In its filing, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that the court order should be stayed because `` once released to plaintiff and sold to the public, the weapons are effectively outside the control of the defendants, and therefore, capable of being put to anti-personnel uses which the ongoing <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> review is designed to investigate.'' The government said <PERSON> Acker </PERSON>'s ruling `` is likely to spur similar actions'' by other gun importers. `` While the 5,200 guns imported by Gun South are a clearly significant number of weapons, the suspension of outstanding permits applies to approximately 640,000 guns,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> noted. `` The specter of release of approximately 640,000 weapons which are unlikely to be recovered upon possible reversal of the district court's judgment highlights the potential for harm to the public,'' the government's brief said. <PERSON> Acker </PERSON>'s order does not affect other rifles, but in his ruling he criticized the ban, which was initiated by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, the federal drug policy coordinator. <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> held that the import ban interferes with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' right to enact laws.

<HEAD>Justice Department Sues Insurer Over Medicare Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> filed suit Friday to recover millions of dollars in <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> payments it claimed should have been paid for elderly workers insured by the <ORGANIZATION> Travelers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION>. The lawsuit against the Hartford-based insurance company was filed as part of the government's continuing investigation to recover payment by Medicare of medical expenses that should have been paid by private companies insuring elderly workers. The lawsuit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, charged that the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> overpayments were made to elderly workers and their spouses covered by group-health insurance plans underwritten by Travelers. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> suit did not seek a specific amount of money, but Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said in a statement that the government believes it is owed millions of dollars. A public relations spokesman for the company could not be reached at the Travelers' headquarters in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>. The suit charges that <ORGANIZATION> Travelers </ORGANIZATION> paid only benefits not covered by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> despite 1982 legislation that made private insurance companies the primary payers of health insurance for employed workers between the ages of 65 and 69. Similar lawsuits have been filed against <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross-Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and Provident Life and <ORGANIZATION> Accident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said the department `` will continue to bring these lawsuits where warranted to stop this practice and to return to the Medicare program the money that has been overpaid. An audit by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> uncovered the overpayments, which some officials estimate could total hundreds of millions of dollars. The <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported earlier this month that its examination of Medicare records suggested the overpayments could total as much as $ 10 billion since 1983.

 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s political department, A.I. <PERSON> Grienko </PERSON>, suggested Friday that <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> demonstrators were responsible for violence that cost lives at a pro-independence protest on April 9. <PERSON> Grienko </PERSON> told Soviet journalists that troops try not to use force to break up demonstrations, but the protest in the Georgian capital, <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, was not peaceful. At least 19 people were killed when troops wielding shovels and clubs, firing gas and riding armored personnel carriers and tanks moved in on the demonstration outside Government House in downtown <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>. At least one more person was shot and killed later for violating a curfew. <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> activists contend the troops brutally moved in without warning and attacked peaceful demonstrators. <PERSON> Grienko </PERSON> said ministry troops display `` the highest professionalism, so there wo n't be victims from any of our actions. ... But that does n't depend on us, because two sides are acting.'' He said the soldiers try to obey the law, respect people and be fair, but `` unfortunately, they do n't always manage to do this'' because of opposing forces. <PERSON> Grienko </PERSON>'s remarks were broadcast on Soviet television's evening news broadcast `` Vremya.'' Also on the program, deputy Soviet prosecutor <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Katusev </PERSON> said four <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> activists arrested shortly after the demonstration were charged with being `` organizers of, and active participants in group actions violating public order.'' <PERSON> Katusev </PERSON> said military prosecutors are investigating whether use of gases to put down the demonstration was proper, and what the 19 protesters died of. Most of those killed were women. Soviet officials acknowledged that soldiers used tear gas. Members of a citizen's commission investigating the confrontation and doctors treating victims say a second gas that paralyzes the central nervous system was used. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Givi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbaridze </PERSON>, said some victims died of gas poisoning.

<TEXT>
 Three men and a woman accused of spying for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and held for months were freed Friday after an appeals court overturned their convictions. They had been given prison sentences ranging from three years to 16 years. International human rights groups had protested the trials held in May and June, 1988, claiming they were political trials. Three were released from the La Modelo prison outside <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, and they were met by their lawyers and weeping relatives. All declared again their innocence. `` If I had been a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent they would never have released me,'' said economist <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Alegria </PERSON>. He had been accused of organizing a network among government employees to provide economic data to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Alegria </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Hernaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON>, said the appeals court accepted the argument he and the other defense attorneys had presented: that none of the laws applicable in the case defined what a `` secret document'' is and the economic information involved was public knowlege and not secret. <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldana </PERSON>, who had been a planning specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> she found out about the appeals court ruling about an hour before she was allowed to leave the prison. She was met by her mother and oldest daughter. `` Inside, I always knew I had done nothing wrong,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Aldana </PERSON>, 45. <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinales </PERSON> wiped tears from his eyes and hugged relatives after leaving <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Modelo </PERSON>. `` I have always said I am innocent,'' said Espinales who worked at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>. `` I did not commit any crime.'' <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Su </PERSON>, was released from another prison near <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. He had been employed at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> when he was arrested. <PERSON> Alegria </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Aldana </PERSON> had been given prison sentences of 16 years and Espinales and Su were sentenced to three years. <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> said that in its ruling the appeals court asked the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to `` define what is in fact a ` secret document'.'' Also on Friday a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, on a 10-nation tour of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, is seeking support for the normalization of relations between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Manolo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> desk, said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> will ask British and West German leaders to help persuade the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to restore normal relations with the Sandinista government. <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> told a news conference President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appears more responsive to change than the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and it is now worthwhile to try new avenues to improve relations. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has visited <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and plans stops in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Icaza </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, also spoke to reporters Friday. He said the renewal of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo means <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> `` must look for alternatives, like talks with donor governments'' at a meeting next month in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. Last week <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced the embardo would be continued. He said the left-wing Sandinista government represents `` an extraordinary threat'' to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security.

<HEAD>Energy Secrtary: Tritium Plant Will Be Flagship of Nuclear Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH GROAT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said Friday he hopes the idle <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear weapons plant will become the `` flagship'' of the nation's nuclear facilities, even though he has delayed reopening it. The Savannah River Site's three nuclear reactors, the nation's sole source of tritium used in the production of nuclear warheads, have been shut down for safety modifications since August <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to tour the plant, said he hoped to announce a startup date for the reactors by July. Earlier this week, he said he would delay resumption of production at the plant, slated for late 1989, until at least early 1990. `` Until we are convinced we have the best interests of our people at heart, the reactors will not be restarted,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told employees at the plant. The energy secretary said it was important to delay the restart `` to demonstrate to -LRB- the -RRB- <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people ... that we know how to manage nuclear technology.'' The 330-acre plant on the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> border manufactures tritium, a radioactive gas used to boost the explosive power of nuclear warheads. Shortly after the reactors were shut down, the department said it could have them running again by late 1988. After that target was missed, the department told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> it expected startup by late this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> warned of an imminent shortage of the vital nuclear material, but that did not discourage <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> from delaying the plant's restart. While the nation's dwindling supply of tritium is a concern, `` it's a matter of what steps we can take. The worst thing would be a preliminary start-up'' of the reactors, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Georgia, who accompanied <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> on a morning tour of the plant. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said he believed the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> Site, once back in operation, would become the best-run facility among the country's nuclear weapons and power plants `` I can see us emerging here as the number one plant in the nation. That's my goal _ to have this plant be the flagship,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told employees at a meeting in the plant's cafeteria. Numerous relevations surfaced about the plant last year, prompting its shutdown. Among them were concern over accidents, lax management and policies that stressed production over safety. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> took over management of the plant on April 1. Before that, it was operated and managed by chemical giant E.I. du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which built the plant 38 years ago.

<HEAD>Pinochet Says He Won't Run For President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Right-wing military President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said Friday he definitely will not run in the Dec. 14 presidential election, but he said he will stay on as commander of the army. Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, speaking at a news conference after swearing in two new ministers to his 16-member Cabinet, also proposed limited changes to the constitution written by the military. `` I feel a deep attachment to the constitution,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said, explaining why he will not run for president. The constitution prohibits him from seeking re-election, but several right-wing groups have insisted in recent months that a formula be found to allow him to run. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> himself previously hinted that he could agree. On Tuesday, he told a group of labor leaders who asked him to run again: `` That does not depend on me, but on you. I am prepared for anything.'' He stressed that he will hand power to the winner in the December election, which he was obliged to call after voters in a referendum last October rejected a military proposal to extend his term until 1997. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said Friday that after leaving the presidency, he will remain as commander of the army, which the constitution allows him to do. `` Under the present circumstances, I think that's the position where I can serve my country best,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said. Opposition parties and even some government supporters repeatedly have criticized <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s decision to remain head of the army, which has been his power base since he seized power in a violent 1973 coup. Critics said his continuation in the nation's top military position would threaten the stability of the future civilian government. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s decision this week to keep Interior Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> was seen by some opposition leaders as an indication that he was finally accepting the constitutional changes sought by opposition and pro-government parties. But on Friday, he made clear that he is offering only limited changes. At the news conference, he listed six possible amendments, far less that those sought by the opposition. He said he is prepared to change an article banning Marxism, to ease the mechanism for future constitutional changes, to drop the presidential power to disband the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and to send citizens into exile; to shorten the eight-year presidential term, and to change the makeup of a powerful military dominated <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. He rejected changes sought by the opposition, including a clause that makes nine members of the 26-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appointed instead of elected, and another that prevents the future civilian government from firing the heads of the three branches of the armed forces and the national police. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Salame </PERSON>, a chemistry teacher, to replace <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON> as education minister; and <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a mining engineer, to replace <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraona </PERSON> as minister of mines.

<HEAD>Britain Taking Threats Against Diplomats Seriously</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it is taking seriously death threats against British diplomats in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in connection with <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book `` The Satanic Verses.'' Senior diplomatic officials were singled out in letters written by a group calling itself <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defenders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purity </ORGANIZATION>, a spokesman said, speaking anonymously in keeping with British practice. He said `` appropriate action'' was taken, but no details were being revealed about people threatened or in what countries they worked. Many Moslems around the world say <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel blasphemes Islam. The book includes a scene in which prostitutes take the names of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s wives, and it suggests <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> wrote the holy Koran, instead of receiving it from <PERSON> Allah </PERSON>. On Feb. 14, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> issued a death sentence against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, who remains in hiding. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> of Moslem parents, now is a British citizen. The <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Libre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION> said Friday in an article signed by crime reporter <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosart </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> received threats. An embassy spokesman in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> confirmed that, but said no staff were singled out by name and no staff were moved to other posts, reported <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the British domestic news agency. Belgian authorities would not comment. <PERSON> Rosart </PERSON> said three letters from <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defenders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purity </ORGANIZATION> which came into the hands of Belgian police blamed the British attitude in the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair and listed British diplomats who were to be killed soon. It said two of the letters went to the embassy. The paper reported that the threats warned family and friends to steer clear of intended victims lest they be harmed, too. It said a large number of these diplomats either returned to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> or were transferred elsewhere. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said: `` Similar letters have gone to various embassies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. These threats are always taken seriously and we have acted accordingly.'' <PERSON> Libre </PERSON> <PERSON> Belgique </PERSON> said Belgian authorities were arranging strict protective measures in view of the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> murder of Imam <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Ahdal </PERSON> and his aide on March 29. Ahdal, a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> cleric and leader of the Moslems of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, was shot after receiving death threats for opposing <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death sentence on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. In other <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> developments: _ <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> strongly protested the showing and sale of a few copies of `` The Satanic Verses'' during <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>'s International Book Fair A statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> on Friday said the action violates Swiss laws calling for respect of religious beliefs and insults the rights of more than 90,000 Moslems living in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. _ A judge in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> ruled on Thursday in favor of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, saying publication of `` The Satanic Verses'' violated religious The Islamic Center, representing Venezuelan Moslems, had brought suit against a publisher planning to bring out the book.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Financial activity slowed Friday due to a shortage of paper money, and President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> scheduled meetings with political, business and labor leaders to discuss solutions to the nation's economic problems. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> ordered a partial bank holiday late Thursday night, explaining that a delay in delivery of imported paper to the national mint, which prints bills, and a labor dispute at the mint had produced a shortage of currency. <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Eilbaum </PERSON> said paper had arrived, the labor conflict had been resolved and that employees would work over the long weekend, which includes a May 1 Labor Day holiday, to resolve the shortage. Meanwhile, he said, Friday banking activity would be restricted to the cashing of pension checks and the paychecks of public and private employees. <PERSON> Eilbaum </PERSON> said no changes in economic or exchange policy were planned and that all banks and exchange houses will open normally on Tuesday. He also denied that the shortage of currency was responsible for the strengthening of the austral, the national currency, against the dollar in financial activity Thursday. The austral on Thursday gained back most of the ground it lost during feverish devaluation earlier in the week, closing at 75 per dollar. The week's fluctuations followed a two-month drop in value of the austral and touched off price increases, the suspension of credit card sales, and shortages of some medicines and foods. The fluctuations also provoked anger at the government and fear of social unrest. The exchange rate on April 21 was 72 to 1; on Monday 82 to 1; on Tuesday 96 to 1 and on Wednesday 84 to 1. The austral, worth 17 to 1 on Feb. 3, has declined in value by about 77 percent since Feb. 5, when the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> allowed the currency to float, ending its policy of using dwindling reserves to prop it up. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> invited presidential candidates, heads of political parties, and business and labor union leaders to separate meetings at the government house and the official residence to discuss the economic crisis as well as steps to be followed during the transition period following scheduled May 14 elections. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> told reporters Thursday that <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> had called the meetings to `` materialize common ideas aimed at improving the economic situation, ensuring the political transition and reassuring the population.'' <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> was expected to seek support for a series of economic measures, including reforms in the exchange market, restraint on government spending and possible steps to increase government income. The General Confederation of Labor, the country's 4 million-member labor federation, called Thursday for immediate payment of the `` mid-year bonus,'' a bonus equivalent to half a month's pay that all employers are obliged to pay employees in June. Labor Minister <PERSON> Ideler </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonelli </PERSON> on Thursday discarded the possibility of an immediate general wage increase, but said the measure could be considered if it became necessary.

 <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, the million-dollar submersible robot, was still missing at sea Friday but its disappearance failed to sink a $ 7 million high school science project. `` <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s still down there, but we're optimistic,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, home base to the propeller-driven remote-control robot sunk to the bottom of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. More than 250,000 students in 13 cities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> were boning up on plate tectonics and underwater volcanoes in preparation for the start Monday of a massive satellite science project gone slightly awry. On Wednesday, museums across <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> were hooked up live via satellite with the Star Hercules, a marine exploration ship anchored over the ancient ruins of a sunken Roman trading ship off the coast. As about 2,000 museum officials, teachers and technicians watched, marine biologists began lowering the 7-foot-long robot and its 8,000-pound mobile garage, Argo, into the ocean for a test run. The footage was to be viewed by thousands of students during a two-week period. All of a sudden, the live cameras focused in on a group of crew members holding the severed cable that once had been <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s lifeline In a flash, the horrible truth emerged: the million dollar robot whose older brother nosed among the Titanic's ruins had sunk 2,100 feet to the soft, silty ocean floor. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said a second consecutive day of churning seas and high winds prevented Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> and his team of marine explorers from sending down a second submersible to rescue its errant predecessor. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, coordinator for the project at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s Museum of Science, said if necessary a slightly less sophisticated backup would be used and the show would go on despite <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s predicament. `` The kids wo n't be disappointed,'' he said. `` Even if they ca n't pick him up before the project gets going, they'll just go back and get <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> later.'' <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> said the project, whose sponsors include <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, Woods Hole, <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, would go on as scheduled between May 1-14.

 Security forces killed 77 leftist guerrillas Friday in two separate attacks in the <LOCATION> Andes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> and the jungle, the government said. It was the heaviest day of fighting in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s nine-year insurgency. Six soldiers and three university students also were killed, officials said. Also Friday, the officials said more than 6,000 people were detained in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> in massive sweeps by police seeking the killers of leftist congressman <PERSON> Eriberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON>, who was slain Thursday. At dawn, troops spotted a column of leftist guerrillas in uniforms near <LOCATION> Molinos </LOCATION>, a tiny village 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, the government said in a communique. In fighting that followed, 62 leftist guerrillas and six soldiers were killed and 23 soldiers were wounded, it said. President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said in a brief radio statement that the rebels were from the Tupac <ORGANIZATION> Amaru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which endorses a <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> styled Marxism and has been active since 1984. Police also killed 15 Maoist Shining Path guerrillas in fighting near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rosa </LOCATION>, a village in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s cocaine-producing jungle 260 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The government said drug traffickers supported the rebels in the clash, but it did not provide further details. The casualties Friday marked the highest number of guerrilla deaths in any single day of fighting during the nine-year insurgency. Thirty-four Shining Path guerrillas died earlier this month in two battles with troops in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle. More than 900 people have died this year in political violence. In related violence, police said the bodies of three students shot to death Friday by Shining Path guerrillas were found at the University of <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>. The region around <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s richest agricultural zones 140 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, has been a growing focus of rebel activity for the past three years. Both the Mao-inspired Shining Path and the smaller Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement are active in the region. The groups are not linked. Analysts said the guerrillas are seeking to disrupt farming and isolate the zone to prevent food from reaching coastal <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, further agravating an severe economic recession that has already sparked temporary food shortages. Police said 6,407 people were arrested and 1,135 automobiles were stopped and searched on city streets late Thursday as police sought the killers of <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the second strongest party in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Police have blamed the Shining Path for the killing, but some members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION>, a Marxist coalition, blamed the murder on on anti-rebel death squad called the <ORGANIZATION> Rodrigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Franco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. During previous sweeps, the vast majority of those detained have been released after proving their identities. Analysts said the spreading violence, coupled with <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s deepest economic recession of the century, has fomented political instability and social chaos that have become a threat to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s The Shining Path has been fighting since 1980 to topple the government. The violence has claimed more than 14,000 lives, including soldiers, police, guerrillas and non-combantants. But most of the dead have been highland peasants caught in the cross-fire between government forces and guerrillas.

About 50 demonstrators were barred from approaching the embassy gate by an equal number of riot police. Some demonstrators trampled on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag but there was no violence.

 Funeral services are scheduled Saturday for controversial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, who went into semi-retirement 14 years ago after a stormy 32-year career on the bench. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> died Thursday at age 89 after a short bout with pneumonia and a long battle with a bleeding ulcer, his family said. He had been hospitalized about two weeks. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> was born Sept. 13, 1899, in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. He received his law degree from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> in 1922 and was a private attorney in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> when President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> put him on the federal bench in 1943. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> often feuded with other federal judges. In 1962, he testified before a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that he was afraid of being poisoned, that his telephone was tapped and that his fellow judges sometimes cursed him. Twice he was removed from hearing multi-million-dollar lawsuits because of alleged personal interest or alleged bias and prejudice. He was indicted by a state grand jury in 1965 for allegedly conspiring to have a road on property he owned paved by the county. The criminal charge later was dismissed. In 1965, the 10th <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> stripped him of his powers for a month, contending he was `` unable or unwilling to discharge efficiently the duties of his office.'' He was embroiled in a libel suit with one attorney and once disbarred the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney and five other federal attorneys in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> from practicing in the federal court. A state court once ordered <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> to pay a $ 50,000 libel judgment to an attorney the judge accused of a $ 1 million fraud in a bankruptcy case. The verdict was overturned in federal appeals courts. In 1974, <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> disbarred <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkett </PERSON>, four of <PERSON> Burkett </PERSON>'s assistants and an <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> lawyer from practicing in the federal courts of western <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. The judge contended the attorneys were illegally hiding a witness in a case involving then Gov. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. The 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> overturned <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>'s order eight months later <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> offered to retire in 1973, but only if he could name his successor. When <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> announced in May 1975 that he would take senior status at age 75, President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> accepted his letter of retirement in a matter of hours. Judicial retirement formalities usually take up to a month. As a senior judge, <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> was still eligible to hear cases, but his caseload was greatly reduced. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in 1959-60, and was on the governing council of the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, 1956-1973. In 1960 he was inducted into the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fame </LOCATION>. From 1960-63 he was professor of law at <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

 Cards, calls and compassion were pouring in Friday for the desperate young father who held hospital workers at gunpoint as he removed his comatose baby son from life-support systems and held him till he died. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>, 23, a house painter from west suburban <PERSON> Cicero </PERSON>, faces first-degree murder charges in the death early Wednesday of his 16-month-old son, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>. `` I would fly to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> tomorrow ... and do anything I could to help this guy because I feel that there but for the grace of God go I,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Killigrew </PERSON>, parent of a brain-damaged child, said from <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> had been in a coma, partially brain dead, since he swallowed a balloon at an Aug. 2 birthday party, blocking the flow of oxygen to his brain The toddler was considered to be in a `` irreversible vegetative coma,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>'s physician at pediatric intensive care at Rush-Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s Medical Center <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> has said he did not believe he could legally comply with the family's request months ago for withdrawal of life support though he was `` personally and professionally sympathetic.'' Under state child-abuse laws, support could be withdrawn only if <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> had been found to be totally brain-dead or his heart and lungs had stopped functioning, said <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a lawyer for the hospital. The family had planned to see a lawyer Friday to discuss their options. `` This is something that should not be the choice of government, it's a private individual's choice,'' <PERSON> Killigrew </PERSON> said in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. When his 17-month-old daughter, <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON>, suffered severe brain damage from a 1970 case of spinal meningitis, <PERSON> Killigrew </PERSON> said a sympathetic doctor allowed him `` agonizing choice'' of letting her go, rather than prolonging treatment. <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> told reporters: `` I did it because I love my son.'' Assistant Public Defender <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> has said his client will plead innocent. <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> is free on a $ 75,000 recognizance bond but was ordered Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bastone </PERSON> to undergo a psychiatric examination to determine whether he `` is any danger to himself or anyone else.'' Public defender <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullane </PERSON> told the court <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> took matters in his own hands after a nurse left a message on the family's answering machine that said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> was to be moved `` to a long-care residential facility to die.'' Hospital officials, however, said the message made no reference to the child's being `` transferred to die'' and was left only after repeated attempts to reach the <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> and his 21-year-old wife, <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON>, had failed. <PERSON> Mullane </PERSON> said the baby's funeral is scheduled Monday at an undisclosed location. Residents of the <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>' working-class neighborhood said they had received so many calls offering financial help for the family that they plan to set up a fund at a <LOCATION> Cicero </LOCATION> bank to help cover medical bills and other expenses.

 A huge portrait of Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> is to be banished from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s main square this May Day, just two weeks before Soviet president <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s ceremonial welcome on the same square. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Yue </PERSON> <PERSON> Yanghua </PERSON> said Saturday that for the first time in three decades, portraits of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> and <PERSON> Engels </PERSON> will not appear for May Day, a major labor holiday in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other socialist nations. <PERSON> Yue </PERSON> said the only portrait to appear on Tiananmen Square this year and in the future will be that of <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yatsen </LOCATION>, founder of the first Chinese republic.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said in an interview Friday he expects Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms to `` ultimately fail'' and that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will be replaced by anti-Western leader `` My personal view is that the task he set for himself to trying to fundamentally reform the Soviet system is incapable of occuring,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said in the interview taped for broadcast Saturday on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Novak'' program. `` If I had to guess today, I would guess that he would ultimately fail,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> suggested in the interview that the Soviet leader's political survival hinges on the success of the economic and political reforms he has instigated `` That is to say, that he will not be able to reform the Soviet economy ... And when that happens, he's likely to be replaced by somebody who will be far more hostile than he's been in terms of his attitude towards the West,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. His comments followed closely the answers he gave a congressional committee earlier this week when asked about the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's proposed reductions in the Pentagon budget. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday there is `` a very real likelihood'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms would fail and that he would either have to change course or hand over power. He said in the interview that the Pentagon cutbacks announced Tuesday, which included delays in several weapons programs, are not part of an overall plan to scale back Western defenses because of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s peaceful overtures. `` He could modify his policies and have to accomodate a more conservative line,'' he said of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` He could conceivably be replaced.

 A convicted murderer freed from a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> prison after asserting his innocence for 21 years, visited the tomb of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on Friday and vowed to work to help troubled young people. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, sentenced to death in 1968 in the poisoning deaths of his seven children, won his freedom Tuesday after a judge ruled that his murder trial was tainted by prosecutorial misconduct. He has insisted he did not kill the children, who ate a prepared lunch tainted with the pesticide parathion, and sworn affidavits implicated the family's baby sitter as a suspect. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, flanked by civil rights activists, spoke to reporters at the King Center in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, telling the dramatic tale of his near-execution and his years in prison. `` I've seen things you never thought in your whole life,'' he said, describing how he saw young inmates raped and brutalized by other prisoners. `` I want to get started on things I've wanted to do to help,'' he said, adding that he hopes to work with alcoholics and young people. `` So many of our young people are going to prison. ... They do n't need this. I want to tell our young generation to get themselves together.'' Activist <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, who underwent open-heart surgery in prison, will join the staff of the <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Diet </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resort </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, encouraging other heart patients to stay healthy. Friday evening, <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. `` I feel pretty good so far,'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> told reporters. `` I have n't made any plans at this time but to be with Mr. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>. I think it's going to be wonderful.'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> is to spend the weekend at the clinic. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> has offered a $ 100,000-a-year job at the diet clinic to the 53-year-old former orange picker, who has until June 1 to decide on a contract, said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> also will work with the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> in its programs against drug and alcohol abuse and will counsel prison inmates, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said, praising <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> for his loving attitude. `` I can not believe that this man ... is not bitter,'' <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said. `` If he was bitter, I could sympathize with him, but I would n't hire him.'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> sat before King's tomb and sang out the words on the slain civil rights leader's crypt: `` Free at last, free at last, thank God almighty, I'm free.'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> used the same words on the first full day of his release. <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s case `` underscores and affirms, again and again, the argument against the death penalty. One of the damnable things about the death penalty is you can not correct a mistake. He would be dead.'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s death sentence was commuted to a life term in 1972 after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> struck down the nation's capital punishment laws. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, his wife and daughter have authorized him to seek compensation from those responsible for imprisoning <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, a step that must be taken before the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> could consider a relief bill to award damages.

 The launch of Atlantis was scrubbed Friday less than a minute before its planned liftoff when controllers detected an electrical surge in a main engine fuel pump. Five astronauts were on board, along with a robot probe that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is sending to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. `` We're disappointed we could n't go today, but we're satisfied with the checks and balances inherent in the launch system,'' said mission commander <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. `` We are prepared to go as soon as the bird is fixed, and we are confident it will be done quickly and safely.'' Launch director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said it will be at least Monday before a second launch attempt can be made, and he termed that timetable `` optimistic'' after revealing that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> was also checking on an unexpected `` vapor cloud'' that emerged around a hydrogen fuel line. Among tens of thousands who gathered for the rare afternoon liftoff were some of the country's most renowned planetary scientists. They have been waiting to resume solar system exploration since 1978, when <PERSON> Pioneer-Venus </PERSON> was launched on the last <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planetary expedition. `` That's just the way it is,'' shrugged <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Head </PERSON>, a geologist from <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> following the postponement. `` We've got a nice long launch window,'' he said, noting <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has until May 28 to get <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> on its way. `` We have waited a number of years for this flight, and a few extra days wo n't matter,'' said <PERSON> Lennard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist. `` The window is a month long. Having the shuttle ready on the first day is ample time to solve the problem and get us on our way to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> probably would not understand the precise cause of the problem until inspecting the spacecraft over the weekend. He also said technicians, reviewing film, discovered that a troubling vapor cloud appeared around a fuel line towards the end of the countdown. He said it could be `` well into next week,'' if <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has to replace the pump or the fuel line. For a Monday launch, `` Both of them would have to fall into a quick fix, and it would be optimistic to expect that.'' The postponement set back <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to eject its robot <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft out of the shuttle, toward <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. The $ 550-million <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> mission would revitalize <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s unmanned space science program. Atlantis' astronauts were strapped in and the countdown was advancing toward a launch, less than a minute to go, when a controller detected something wrong on a monitor and informed <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON>: `` Possible problem with an engine 1 recirculation pump ... recommend hold at T-31 seconds.'' Launch commentator <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> quickly reported, `` There is not enough time to recycle and launch today.'' The pump circulates liquid hydrogen to keep fuel lines cool before engine ignition. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodkins </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Orbiter Division, said that 50 seconds before the planned launch, monitors detected a sudden power surge reading of 21 amps on the pump's electrical circuitry. Normal, he said, is 2 to 3 amps. `` The spike tripped the circuitry,'' forcing a shutown, <PERSON> Hodkins </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> had said, `` The problem may not be in the pump at all. It might be in ground support equipment or somewhere in the orbiter.'' `` If the fixes are simple, we can maintain the possibility of a Monday afternoon launch,'' he said. `` If we have to replace the pump or the -LRB- fuel -RRB- line, we could go well into next week.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said the first goal of the launch team was to `` get the crew safely out of there'' by making certain all systems were stable. The astronauts reset switches in the cabin before taking the elevator to the base of the pad for a trip back to their crew quarters. The astronauts _ Walker, pilot <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabe </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleave </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Thagard </PERSON> _ returned to crew quarters. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had set Atlantis' liftoff between 2:24 p.m. and 2:47 p.m., a narrow window dictated by the need to deploy the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> payload from a precise location above the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and a requirement that the shuttle go before darkness fell at emergency landing sites in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. The space agency must send <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> on its way between April 28 and May 28 because that is when <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> are in proper alignment. If the spacecraft can not be launched by the end of May, officials would have to wait two years before the two planets again are in the desired position. The countdown had been almost flawless until the last minute. The only snag was a problem with a range-safety tracking computer that set back the count six minutes. `` All systems were ready to support a launch until we hit that unexpected problem,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. When Atlantis is launched, the astronauts are to release <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> from the cargo bay and start it on a 450-day, 806-million-mile journey to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. It will be the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planetary flight in 11 years. The 7,600-pound spacecraft is to loop into orbit around <LOCATION> Venus </LOCATION> in August 1990 and map up to 90 percent of the surface with a high-resolution radar system that will pierce the planet's sulfuric acid clouds. The photos could disclose much about the history of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and why it evolved so differently than its sister planet <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, even though scientists believe they were almost identical at the formation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago.

<TEXT>
 Several days of storms washed oil off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> beaches and back into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, but concentrations are far lighter than in the first weeks after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, an official said Friday. `` We're seeing sheens that are almost solely associated with rewashing,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Galt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> after several storms brought the cleanup to a standstill for three days. Most of the oil remained off <LOCATION> Eleanor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the center of the sound, <PERSON> Galt </PERSON> said. The concentrations, however, are nothing like they were two weeks after the tanker ran aground. `` It's heavy only in a relative sense,'' he said. `` Compared to what we were seeing two weeks ago, three weeks ago, it's quite light.'' But <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamoreaux </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> said the bad weather was a disadvantage because it hindered clean-up operations. `` Both of us are reflecting something realistic,'' said <PERSON> Lamoreaux </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> DEC </ORGANIZATION>'s coordinator of the spill effort. Stormy weather can have a a favorable effect, but ongoing clean-up work remains essential, he said. <PERSON> Lamoreaux </PERSON> said the state's aerial surveys show a number of areas where oil appears sufficiently concentrated for effective skimming. The storms washed oil off some beaches and back into the fish-rich sound, where gray whales migrating north stop over every summer and where pregnant seals soon will haul out to have their pups. The weather kept skimming operations to a minimum on the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Parts of the sound had very rough seas, including the waters around <LOCATION> Smith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> where the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> is anchored with 343 cleanup workers. Exxon and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said workers would n't leave the ship because of rough seas and winds in excess of 30 mph were reported Friday. In other developments: _ The attorney for Capt <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>'s skipper was n't trying to free his ship from the reef as taped conversations between the ship and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> seem to indicate. Some officials had worried that <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> risked breaking the ship on the reef. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said his client was trying `` to keep the vessel on the ledge'' and that <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was `` concerned about coming off the ledge and possibly capsizing or breaking up.'' The tapes seem to contradict <PERSON> Chalos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> an hour after the ship ran aground that `` We're in pretty good shape now, stability-wise, and, ah, trying to extract her off the shoal here. Once we get under way I'll let you know.'' _ Gov <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> accused Exxon of misleading the public with a campaign of `` tall tales'' aimed at shifting blame for the slow response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill to the state. <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON>'s repeated statements that the state refused to approve the use of chemical dispersants soon after the spill were `` demonstrably false.'' The statements have been repeated in the national news media and by federal officials, including <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, giving them increased credibility, <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. `` If an untrue statement continues to be repeated time after time after time after time, and you do n't make an effort to refute that statement, then people will believe it like it was gospel. Obviously, that's happening now,'' he said. `` The fact is Exxon did not have the capability to carry out any kind of oil recovery that was very effective,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>, the state's chief environmentalist said. <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> fired back at the governor late Friday, accusing him in turn of spreading wrong information. In a letter to <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>, a copy of which was obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> had enough dispersants on hand and en route to `` contain the spill and significantly mitigate the impact of the oil on the shoreline.'' An <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> mountain climber, meanwhile, took his own protest to an eight-story office building in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> where <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has offices. <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> police said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tumey </PERSON> climbed out on the roof of the building and rappelled down, stopping at about the fourth floor to attach a banner that read: `` Oil Spilled, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> Kills, Remember The Sound.'' When he completed his descent, <PERSON> Tumey </PERSON> was arrested on trespassing charges but not before he pulled a dead, oily seabird from his backpack to show the gathered cameramen, photographers and small crowd.

<HEAD>Timber Industry Owly About Talking With `Enviros' Over Threatened
Species</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Timber industry officials angrily accused environmentalists Friday of using threats against the spotted owl as a propaganda `` hoax,'' and promised to mount a national effort to preserve forest lands for logging. The statements at a news conference appeared to dampen efforts by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s congressional delegation and environmentalists to negotiate a way to protect both logging jobs and the endangered owl. Prodded by environmentalists, the federal Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> this week recommended listing the Northern spotted owl, which inhabits forests from northern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, as a `` threatened'' species. That would involve preserving a large number of acres of old-growth forest for the approximately 1,500 breeding pairs of owls left. Each pair would require as much as 2,200 acres under a draft <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> plan. Industry officials, however, contend that action could result in as many as 280,000 job layoffs. Losses could reach $ 6.2 billion in payrolls, $ 900 million in payments to local counties and $ 3 billion in timber receipts to the federal treasury, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's warfare between the preservationists and the industry,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loggers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He accused `` enviros'' of using the spotted owl issue to bring logging in old growth forests to a halt. `` By the time all these studies -LRB- on owl populations -RRB- are done, five years from now, I think we'll find that this is the biggest hoax that's ever been pulled on the American public,'' he said. `` But by that time if these -LRB- timberland -RRB- set-asides are allowed to continue, the devastation to the industry and the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> economy will be equivalent to that <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> bomb.'' <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuehne </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>, said the industry was forming a national group called the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. He said it would battle environmentalist efforts to make inroads against logging in all areas of the country, and would back up industry efforts to seek federal legislation designating lands for logging. <PERSON> Kuehne </PERSON> said the industry would only sit down to the negotiating table over the spotted owl issue as part of national talks pitting environmental issues against timber issues. The forest industry officials' estimates of damage to the timber industry were disputed by <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Durning </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s office in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> `` I am distressed with the exaggerated claims ... of job losses and money losses to the economy that the industry has been making,'' she said. She said a society report last fall concluded that only 2,300 jobs would be lost over the next 40 years if significant stands of old-growth timber were set aside to save the owls. At the same time, she said, 26,500 jobs would be lost due to mill modernization. `` Conservationists recognize that achieving a healthy economy for the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s timber-dependent area is part of the picture by which we will also achieve protection for ancient forests,'' she said. The news conference followed a meeting between Reps. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wash </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, R-Wash., and more than two dozen representatives of the timber Both congressmen expressed hope that the differing sides could begin meetings to resolve the owl issue. `` I think it's essential to work with them and see what we can come up with,'' said <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>. However, many at the meeting expressed doubt the industry could make any headway against the environmentalists' position, noting that court decisions have locked up some owl habitat forestlands, at least temporarily.

Airport managing director <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Munds </PERSON> said the passengers and seven crew `` were never in any danger.'' The plane had landed to refuel on a flight from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and was taxiing to the runway for takeoff when two tires burst and flames blazed up. The passengers were taken to hotels to await a replacement airliner due Saturday, an Independent TV News broadcast said.

 Thousands of students screaming `` Yankee go home!'' fought riot police at five universities in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Friday after authorities banned them from marching to the border with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to press for national unification. Police officials said injuries occurred, but they had no figures. In the southeastern industrial cities of <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Masan </LOCATION>, about 6,000 striking workers hurling rocks and firebombs tangled with police for a fifth day, police said. Strikers in <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION> poured oil on streets and set them afire, and protesters in <LOCATION> Masan </LOCATION> used slingshots to pelt police with pieces of scrap metal, they said. About 20 workers were arrested. Student and dissident groups are trying to unite with workers to build an anti-government alliance. Government leaders are concerned about the growing labor unrest and a wave of increasingly violent strikes for more pay and improved working conditions. Police arrested 20 student delegates as they tried to reach the border to meet with North Korean counterparts. The students wanted to discuss taking part in an international youth festival in the north's capital of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> in July, and ways to unite the two Korean states. At <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, black police vans armed with multiple launchers fired hundreds of tear gas rounds into the ranks of 4,000 students fighting officers with wooden clubs, pipes and firebombs while trying to march out of the campus. Fighting flared around the sprawling campus in southern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, with about 3,000 riot police surrounding the school. Hundreds of students fought police on at least four other <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> campuses. Student clashes also broke out in the southern port of <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> and radicals seized a government prosecutors' office in <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, the South Korean news agency. Student leaders lashed out at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in rallies before the clashes, accusing them of perpetuating the division of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, split into communist north and capitalist south after World War II. Also Friday, about 3,400 police officers tendered resignations en masse to protest an alleged assault on a police superintendent by an opposition lawmaker in <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION> the previous day. National Assemblyman <PERSON> Sim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wan-koo </PERSON> was reported to have slapped the suprintendent in the face during a labor protest. National Police Director <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Chong-suk </PERSON> appealed for restraint and returned the resignations. Reports said <PERSON> Sim </PERSON> and four other opposition lawmakers, in <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION> to look into labor unrest, became infuriated when police arrested a union leader they escorted. The man had been sought by police for unlawful labor activity.

 Three South African officials implicated in secretly acquiring British Blowpipe missile parts from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> extremists were ordered to leave <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> by May 2, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Friday.

 Only eight of the 14 winners in the record $ 115 million <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Super 7 lottery had put in claims by Friday, one of whom said she spent a day in a motel because she `` just needed some time to sit.'' By Friday afternoon, the holders of the eight tickets had checked in at lottery headquarters, and officials said two other claimants had contacted them. Four winning tickets were not accounted for. The lucky few, meanwhile, savored their fortune and spun fantasies about the future that no longer seemed so fantastic. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> arrived from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, with their sons, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>, 25, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, 23, and a daughter, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON>, 20. They bought 80 tickets for the Wednesday night drawing. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, 50, said he tried something Friday he had never done before: `` I lit a cigarette with a dollar bill.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, a former magician who is now a restaurant manager in <LOCATION> Lawrenceville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said he wants to spend some of the winnings on the grave of magician <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Houdini </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` I've had a dream for a long time to refurbish his grave and fix it up,'' he said. <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Trapuzzano </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, arrived Friday with her fiance, father, two brothers and a sister and brother-in-law after waiting a day at a <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> area motel. `` I just needed some time to sit there,'' she told reporters. `` I was shocked and I could n't believe it.'' Trapuzzano, a sales representative, said she had kept the winning ticket `` in a little baggie. I carried it around with me.'' Miss <PERSON> Trapuzzano </PERSON> said her father, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON>, had bought five tickets each for his children after she was unable to buy her own because of long lines. <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jalinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, 74, of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, reached lottery headquarters within five minutes of each other shortly before 4 p.m. EDT. Mrs. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, a widow, said she talked to her dog when she learned she had a big winner in her stack of 15 tickets. `` He smiled,'' she said. Lottery Executive Director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON> said the individual ticket validation will take until next week and the first checks will be presented then. The 14 jackpot tickets, each with seven winning numbers, are worth $ 8.3 million over 26 years, or $ 317,524.67 a year before taxes. Tickets with six winning numbers pay $ 4,842.50 and five winning numbers, $ 274.50. Tickets with four winning numbers pay $ 7. Also claiming a jackpot ticket were three <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> maintenance workers: <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 40; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, 38; and <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON>, 40, along with <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Connie </PERSON>, 39. In 1984, <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON> was electrically shocked on the job and was on disability before returning to a lower level job at half pay. He said his first reaction to winning was fear. `` If you got $ 100 million, you'd better be worried. We got the kids out of the house. Basically, we just left,'' <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON> said. He said he was relieved to share the prize. His ticket, potentially worth $ 317,524 a year for 26 years, will be split three ways. Two couples from the Erie area also put in a claim for a single ticket. They were <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> of <PERSON> McKean </PERSON> <PERSON> Township </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wesleyville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 34, and <PERSON> White </PERSON>, 42, learned of their potential win at their $ 35,000-a-year jobs at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>. They said they did a victory dance. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said he called his wife at Alliance Plastics, telling her: `` ` Walk out, quit, you're done! We hit the big one! We're millionaires! She did n't believe me. She found out when she got home.'' Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON>, 41, said she usually worked seven days a week for about $ 6 an hour at what is now her former job. She said she wants a new car to replace the 1979 model her husband gave away to a friend after he learned of the big win. The Whites said they will take their daughter, son and four grandchildren for a trip to <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>. A group of 14 workers from the <LOCATION> Windham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, area and three family members from western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> also claimed single tickets Thursday.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> agreed to remove the American flag from six Kuwait-owned oil tankers that sailed under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> protection during the Iraq-Iran war in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, officials said Friday. The decision, announced by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, ended two months of deadlock between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> officials over what had been assumed to be a routine matter when first announced last February. According to official sources in the gulf and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Kuwaitis </PERSON> objected to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legal provision stipulating that even after the vessels reverted to Kuwaiti registry, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would retain the right to requisition them for use in a national emergency. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> officials rejected such a condition as infringing on <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> sovereignty. They said the two sides finally agreed that the tankers would be returned to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> rather than to the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which actually operates them. Although the tanker company is wholly government-owned, the sources said, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials deemed the distinction sufficient for a waiver of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s obligation to make the ships available to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Oates </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said he could not comment other than to say the agreement became effective as of Thursday. Kuwaiti officials were not available to comment. The six ships include two petrolem product tankers and four identical liquefied gas carriers. They were among 11 Kuwait-owned tankers reflagged by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in mid-1987, entitling them to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval escort. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> at that time was attacking Kuwaiti shipping because of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s support for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the war. Hostilities ended last Aug. 20 with a U.N.-mediated cease-fire. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> had set up a new company, the <ORGANIZATION> Chesapeake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, as ostensible <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> owners of the tankers. <PERSON> Chesapeake </PERSON> will `` sell'' the six ships back to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> in a transaction existing only on paper, the sources said. The other five tankers will continue to fly the Stars and Stripes, at least until next February, on condition that all-American crews replace the regular crews during that period. At the time of the reflagging in 1987, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration waived a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law requiring U.S.-flagged ships to have all-American crews.

<TEXT>
 A federal prosecutor promised Friday that evidence would paint `` a dark picture of greed'' at the racketeering trial of <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, the ex-lawyer of former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. In his opening statement to the jury, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Baruch </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and two other defendants had turned the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> into `` a vehicle for their own personal financial gain.'' But a defense attorney countered later that the bulk of the government's case was based on the testimony of corrupt ex-Wedtech executives with `` a history of deceiving and lying.'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, ex-Meese financial adviser <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>'s business associate, <LOCATION> R. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, are charged in a 21-count racketeering indictment with taking more than $ 1 million from the one-time defense contractor in phony consultants' fees and payoffs _ including $ 525,000 allegedly paid to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and other government officials. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, had gone to law school with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and they were `` very close friends.'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who expected to get a high government job after <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> became attorney general in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, had a secret agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, in effect, agreed to be <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s mole in the federal government,'' he added. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Naftalis </PERSON>, conceded that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> were good friends but he called them `` a political odd couple'' because <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was a staunch conservative while <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was `` a bleeding heart liberal.'' The lawyer attacked former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials, who already have pleaded guilty to corruption charges and will testify for the government. <PERSON> Naftalis </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was as much a victim of the greed and dishonesty of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executives as were investors and employees. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> `` fell for the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> dream hook, line and sinker,'' said the defense lawyer. Once a small <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> machine shop, <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> grew into a $ 100 million government contractor through a special <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> program that set aside contracts without competitive bidding for minority-controlled companies. In previous cases, prosecutors have maintained that <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> continued to receive the no-bid contracts even after it ceased being a minority-owned company, through a series of bribes to numerous officials. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was never charged with any criminal activities, although his ethics were questioned by a special prosecutor in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> who said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> could have been hit with tax and conflict-of-interest charges. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is expected to testify at the trial at federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, 46, who divides his time between <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, all face maximum 20-year sentences if convicted of racketeering, the most serious charges. Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, his son, and four others were convicted last summer of corruption charges that they turned <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> into a racketeering enterprise. Former White House aide <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> was convicted last year of illegal lobbying on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. Others convicted in Wedtech-related cases include two former <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> legislators, two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area Teamsters officials, the former commander of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and a former <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, is awaiting trial on charges that he extorted $ 185,000 in cash and a diamond and emerald necklace from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Saturday the U.S.-Australia alliance is stronger than ever despite a flap over American grain subsidies. `` I came here with expectations ... these expectations have been surpassed,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters at his second news conference since arriving in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> four days ago. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vice president was flying to the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> on Saturday to do some snorkeling before heading for <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> on Sunday. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s trip has been marked by criticism from Australian officials over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' Export Enhancement Program, which provides subsidies to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain growers. The Australians say the subsidy program has cut into their exports to other markets although <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> maintained during his four-day visit here that it was aimed at countering only <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s protectionist policies Asked if the debate over exports had hurt the alliance, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` I do n't believe we have angered the Australian government.'' Overall, he said, the two countries share a common strategy of opening markets around the world and eliminating trade restrictions. However, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> acknowledged his trip had provided him an education on the issue. `` I am far more sensitive to that issue than before I came,'' he said at the conference held in the <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> Opera House. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he was `` impressed by the directness of the Australian people'' and liked their approach in addressing him `` by my first name.'' `` Personally I enjoy candor,'' he said. Another issue that has come up during <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit was the status of the Australian-New Zealand-U.S. military alliance known as <ORGANIZATION> ANZUS </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> has indicated his country might formally leave the pact. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that alliance `` is stronger than ever,'' too, despite a virtual freeze in relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s anti-nuclear stance. The policy prevents <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships armed with nuclear weapons from making port calls. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said there is still a `` vacant chair'' for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> in the tripartite pact should it chose to return to full participation and that he hoped that would be as soon as possible. The Australians have complained that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidies on wheat hurt their exports abroad, an argument that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> rejected. `` We do not believe that it is injuring <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>,'' he said. In an editorial Friday, The Australian, a nationally circulated newspaper, said, `` Who do you think you are kidding, Mr. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>? Read our lips, Mr. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Australians are not happy.'' All in all, however, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been well-received in a country that enjoys smooth relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Talking with reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> called <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> a very important country, with which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has close ties. He said his meetings with officials in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> _ countries he visits next on his 12-day foreign trip _ might be more contentious because of frictions with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, particularly on trade issues.

 Police arrested five suspected drug traffickers and seized 609 pounds of semi-processed cocaine after a light plane crash-landed near the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> border, <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Efrain </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said Friday.

The incident occurred April 17 but was not reported until Friday to permit an investigation, <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said. All those arrested are Colombians, he said. In another incident, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comercio </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, said a small plane carrying 440 pounds of semi-processed cocaine crashed Tuesday in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s isolated <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle. Two suspected Colombian drug traffickers were killed, <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comercio </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. Officials say <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is the source of about 60 percent of the world's coca leaf, the raw material of cocaine.

 A grenade launcher, three machine guns and other weapons were seized by police who arrested six people at a motel Friday and authorities reported finding a Nazi flag in a car searched during the raid. Federal weapons charges were lodged against five Texans and a local man after authorities said they seized an M-16 grenade launcher, three machine guns, five handguns, four rifles, a shotgun, five automatic weapons and 10 silencers in the pre-dawn raid on three rooms of a motel in the city's northeast section. City police and federal agents sought to determine what those who were arrested had planned to do with the weapons. `` They're very destructive sort of weapons,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>, assistant special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> field office `` They have the power to kill people or to inflict serious bodily injury.'' Six children, aged 7 to 15, were found in the motel rooms and taken into protective custody, <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> said. A Nazi flag was found in one of two cars, bearing <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> license plates, searched during the raid, said <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>. Authorities said the investigation started less than 24 hours after the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> field office received a call from a suburban <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> woman, who was not further identified, saying that her son, identified as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnhart </PERSON>, 33, had been kidnapped. The woman said <PERSON> Barnhart </PERSON> had been missing for two weeks and instructed her to wire him $ 1,000 here or `` some harm would come to him,'' according to <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents traced <PERSON> Barnhart </PERSON> to the motel and quickly determined that he had n't been kidnapped, <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> said. `` Apparently they may have been low on funds and this may have been an effort by him to get some additional funds,'' <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> said. `` It's unfortunate that he would involve his mother.'' Police and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, with assistance from the the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, stormed the three hotel rooms simultaneously at 3:30 a.m., EDT, said Sgt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The Nazi flag, several knives and assorted documents also were recovered, he said, refusing to divulge the contents of the documents. Two people, identified as <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McEwen </PERSON>, 40, and his wife, <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> McEwen </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Rowlett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, suffered minor injuries during the raid when officers restrained them from going for their weapons, according to <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>.

 Five congressmen put a trio of leading judges on notice: the pay raise so vigorously sought by federal judges may well depend on denying it to senior judges who do no judicial work. `` Pay raises should be reserved for those who work,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> courts subcommittee His message was echoed by four <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> colleagues at a hearing Thursday. They were taken aback by testimony from the judicial leaders, who are seeking a 30 percent pay raise for all federal judges. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffin </PERSON> depicted a federal bench demoralized over the loss of a 51 percent pay raise earlier this year, but he displayed no willingness to compromise in response to complaints over pay that members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> hear when they go home to the voters. `` I have never seen so many judges at all levels, in all courts, and in all parts of the country so disheartened as I do today,'' <PERSON> Coffin </PERSON> said. `` Ours is a lunar landscape with all of the stark and ominous silhouettes that the term implies.''

Excerpts from the meeting were published Thursday in Pravda, the party's official newspaper. Officials said one reason for the loss of faith has been that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s 4-year-old restructuring program of perestroika has failed to solve many of the country's problems. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in closing remarks at the meeting Tuesday, agreed perestroika was going poorly and was worsening shortages of housing, consumer goods and food. But, the 58-year-old leader said, people still have faith in the party. `` I do not agree with extreme judgments that the party is nearly losing its position in the country or that it has turned into a debating society and so on,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said.

 `` Miami Vice'' has gone cold. CBS' `` Wiseguy'' has become the hottest show in prime time It's also the hippest guest shot on TV. The current storyline, about the recording industry, guest stars rock stars <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Frey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, cult actor <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' -RRB- and former <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> main squeeze <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Arbanville </PERSON>. An earlier storyline lured reverse-cool <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> into a rare television role. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> winner <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> -LRB- `` Speed-the-Plow'' -RRB- played <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' son. The attention is welcome _ for now _ but the pitfalls of being annointed as hot by the coolest of the cool is not lost on the show's producer-writers, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Kronish </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>. `` When you get too cool, you can get cold,'' said <PERSON> Kronish </PERSON>, sitting in <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s office in the <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> Productions building in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, a long way from <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, where `` Wiseguy'' is filmed. <PERSON> Kronish </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> plan to avoid big-name stars in the future and return to the obscure, offbeat casting that impressed the industry and TV critics alike when the show premiered last season. The first storyline rejuvenated <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON>'s career. Then, unknowns <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Spacey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Severance </PERSON> made a splash as an incestuous brother-sister crime wave in a second storyline. Another of last season's guest stars was'60s <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> film veteran <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dallesandro </PERSON>. `` Wiseguy'' is something of a distant cousin of `` Miami Vice.'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> co-wrote the pilot of `` Crime Story'' for `` Miami Vice'' executive producer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s road to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> was winding. His father, former late-night <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> talk-show host <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, disapproved of his son's show-biz aspirations, but begrudgingly got him a job with a friend, director <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Preminger </PERSON>. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> moved into documentary production and became a political media consultant for clients ranging from <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>. `` The script that got me essentially plugged into this business I was working on during a tour of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, from television station to television station,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. `` At the end of the day I'd go back to the hotel and sit in the hotel office and work on the script. It's actually a pilot now at <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` Sacraments'' is about the mayor of a large, Northeastern city who came up from the streets, bringing his working-class cohorts into power with him. <PERSON> Kronish </PERSON>, armed with a degree in journalism, got a job as talent coordinator on a local talk show in <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>. A play he had written landed him his first script-writing job after he was variously unemployed, an insurance salesman and an assistant golf pro His first steady TV job was a game show called, appropriately enough, `` Anything for Money.'' While still overseeing `` Wiseguy,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kronish </PERSON> found themselves with another series at midseason, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Unsub,'' about a crack federal forensic unit. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Monas </PERSON>, an attorney friend of <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, had come up with the idea a couple of years ago. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> mentioned it to <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON>, but other projects ensued and <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> forgot about it. At a lunch last fall with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> offhandedly pitched `` Unsub.'' The show was on the air three months later. `` Unsub'' was a modestly successful midseason replacement. `` Wiseguy,'' meanwhile, has begun to catch on. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, picking up on the cult status of the show, has launched an aggressive ad campaign. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kronish </PERSON> are hoping, though, that the show is not a mega-hit. `` Maybe the fact that it is n't does give us a certain amount of freedom to do things that a hit show might not be able to do,'' said <PERSON> Kronish </PERSON>. `` I think the people who like ` Wiseguy' like it because we've done things that are relatively unexpected, and I think we deal with the sort of gray areas of these characters' lives that a lot of episodic TV does n't deal with. `` I think that we have n't been a hit in terms of big numbers was a benefit in terms of being left alone to do what we want,'' said <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>. `` I found this year, particularly following the -LRB- <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis-Ron </PERSON> Silver storyline -RRB-, we suddenly were being watched a lot more closely by everybody, the network, people out there who watch the show in general, and the question of, can we do that? became one that started getting asked, and it was never asked before.''

<HEAD>Government Fights Misconceptions as Concern About AIDS Grows</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The widely publicized death of a prostitute has increased concern about AIDS, and officials are trying to dispel false ideas about the disease in a nation where sex is a flourishing trade. Officials say at least 22 people in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> have developed active AIDS cases and 100 have been identified as carriers of the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Sixty-one of the 100 carriers are female prostitutes and 50 of them work near Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay naval base, the two huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Erlinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>, the national AIDS registrar, believes the true figures are higher. She says inadequate testing and reporting methods may be missing 90 percent of the carriers. Since 30 per cent of carriers develop symptoms of the disease in five years, She fears AIDS cases could reach 300 by then. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, for which there is no cure, weakens the body's ability to resist infection and makes the victim vulnerable to a range of fatal illnesses. It is spread by sexual contact, use of infected needles and contaminated blood products. Officials say all but three of the 22 AIDS patients acquired the disease abroad. Two of the three who contracted it in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> have died. A male homosexual died last year and the second victim was a 24-year-old bar girl from <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, home of <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. Her death last month was widely publicized. She died at the time of newspaper reports that a young Brazilian woman, who claimed to have had sex with many prominent Filipinos, tested positive for the AIDS virus. The Brazilian has left the country and, because of privacy regulations, health officials refuse to confirm whether she was infected. Officials say AIDS could spread rapidly in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> because of prostitution and public misconceptions of the disease. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Resurrecion </PERSON> of the national AIDS control program, said a Gallup survey of 35 nations had the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> among the countries whose people believe the disease can be contracted by working beside infected people or sharing drinking glasses with them, or from insect bites. A survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> found that many male prostitutes thought exercise prevents AIDS, he said. Officials say 94 percent of men who contracted AIDS or carried the virus had not used condoms. Health Department workers are studying ways to combat AIDS myths and are instructing the public on effective precautions. Officials plan to spend most of the $ 467,290 allocated for AIDS control on print and broadcast advertising. `` Our basic goal is to change the behavior of people, considering that each individual has the responsibility to protect himself,'' Dr. <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, city health officer <PERSON> Proceso </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> said posters saying `` Prevent AIDS, Use Condoms'' and `` No Condom, No Sex'' were placed in the bar district. The high percentage of AIDS carriers among prostitutes working near <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases has led some women's groups to urge that the installations be closed to keep the disease from spreading. `` We think AIDS is coming to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> through the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases,'' said <PERSON> Adul </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, an official of the militant feminist organization <PERSON> Gabriela </PERSON>, which demands that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> finance AIDS control programs. Dr. <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> said the high incidence around the bases may be traceable to the fact that, since <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities paid for the program, 67 per cent of the 108,000 screened were from those areas. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have promised that any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> service member found to carry the virus will not be assigned to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.

 For <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s chaotic blend of plenty and want, success and failure is a vision of what may await the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as it embarks on economic and social reform. He arrives May 15 on a mission to normalize relations between the two Communist giants after 30 years of hostility. One thing he will take home is a lesson in the difficulties of easing a communist state's grip on the economy. Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> began market-oriented reforms 10 years ago, long before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and perestroika came along. Gross national product has tripled. Foreign trade has gone from $ 40 billion in 1980 to $ 100 billion last year. Per capita income still is equivalent to only about $ 200 a year, but has more than tripled in the decade. Families that once scrimped to buy a bicycle now own refrigerators, color televisions and stereos. The early euphoria is over, however, and the corrosive effects of inflation and corruption threaten the future of liberalization. Annual inflation is more than 30 percent in a nation that for decades banned price increases, and profiteering is rampant. Democratic reform is another story. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has held multiple-candidate elections and opened up the press with his glasnost policy, but <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> believes intellectual freedom should be doled out as economic reforms progress. Huge student demonstrations in past weeks illustrated the profound dissatisfaction of educated Chinese with their government. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> permitted the Democracy Wall movement of 1978-79, in which posters for democracy were displayed, while it served his political purposes. Then he crushed it and threw the leaders in jail. The official press is encouraged to be a watchdog, but is not permitted to criticize <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders or the system. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will be shown the dazzling successes of `` gaige'' and `` kaifang,'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s words for reform and opening to the outside world. Reform has produced 23 million entrepreneurs, many operating from bicycles or roadside stands, who did $ 35 billion -RRB- worth of business last year. Vendors and family farmers freed from now-defunct communes have combined to keep free markets stocked with fruit, vegetables and meat _ afind 16,000 joint ventures in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with a total commitment of $ 25 billion. Many are small textile or appliance factories that have created instant boomtowns in southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, the capitalist enclave. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also has glistening Sheraton and <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> hotels, restaurants ranging from <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON>'s, and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> factories producing <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> autos and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> passenger planes. Four special economic zones have nearly a free hand in seeking foreign investment and are in cutthroat competition, offering preferential treatment to foreign companies. Many of the bold experiments have been slowed by concern for inflation, but not before they transformed concepts of socialist ownership and financing. About 6,000 enterprises have issued shares, mostly to employees. Many economists see shareholding as the best way for money-losing state factories to spur worker initiative and raise capital. Primitive stock markets have sprung up in several large cities and a nationwide stock exchange is being debated. Exchange markets for treasury bonds operate in 61 cities. Real estate markets are emerging as the government encourages private housing and sale of land to developers. Chinese peasants, for millenia harnessed to their plows, have a new mobility. Eighty million, one-tenth of the rural population, have found jobs in the small industries that have provided much of the economic growth. Millions more have been drawn to cities by the booming construction and service industries. Old habits of state interference and the `` iron rice bowl'' of guaranteed employment refuse to die, but factory owners have the right to hire and fire workers. A bankruptcy law permits state factories to be closed for losing money, although they seldom are. Many workers have contracts with their employers and, at least in theory, can quit if something better turns up when the contract is fulfilled. The benefits of economic reform has been great, but the bills are coming due and Chinese leaders flinch at their size. According to official figures, the living standards of one-third of urban residents declined last year because of rising prices. A nationwide mania for building and the state's loss of control over credit have overheated the economy. Excessive growth has caused an energy crunch and shortages of raw materials, which encourage profiteering. Small farmers, once heroes, are being blamed for four successive poor grain harvests because they would rather grow cash crops for the free markets than cheap grain for the state. Last month, the government responded to the bad news with an austerity program that cut off investment credit, canceled thousands of building projects and returned central control to wide areas of prices, finance and foreign trade. It also has put a moratorium on further reforms, the end to price controls deemed essential to achieving balance between supply and demand. Unemployment, theoretically nonexistent in a socialist state, has become reality. The government gives the rate as 2 percent, but does not count millions of people laid off by the closures of rural enterprises whose credito or supplies dried up. Railway stations were clogged last winter with peasants trying to reach cities for construction jobs, most of which already had been eliminated. Leaders have acknowledged their errors and say the reforms will continue when the current mess is cleared up. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, the 84-year-old father of the reforms, told the president of <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION> recently: `` If there had been enough vigilance ... three or four years ago, things would be much better today.'' Deeply disturbing to the Chinese are social problems that did not exist when everyone read from the same Little Red Book and lived in the same egalitarian poverty. Widening income gaps contributed to a 13 percent increase in crime last year. The number of larceny cases rose 64 percent. Elders are horrified by the materialism of the young and their more casual attitudes toward sex and pornography. Cases of venereal disease tripled in 1988, to 56,000. Educated Chinese, long victimized by <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s anti-intellectual policies, are angered by a situation in which doctors and professors are paid the equivalent of $ 50 a month while illiterate street peddlers earn $ 1,000 Thousands want to go abroad for study or work, and many will not return. Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, the cautious technocrat who engineered the current economic slowdown, has led the appeal for a return to the old values of sacrifice and thrift. `` People should be ideologically prepared to live a hard life for a few years,'' he said. Few are. Even the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is plagued by corruption as people use official powers to commandeer and resell scarce industrial and consumer goods. One report from <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> said 150 tons of government fertilizer for grain farmers was sold 26 times before it actually got to them.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were brothers in communism, but the first summit since they fell out nearly 30 years ago will not be a family reunion. The Chinese, determined to show independence from their one-time tutor in revolution, have forced the Soviets to make the overtures and concessions toward normal relations. When <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> comes to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on May 15, it will be <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, the 84-year-old Chinese leader, who plays big brother, because of both age and his pioneering of economic reforms the Soviets are just beginning. During the past year, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pulled Soviet troops out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, announced unilateral troop withdrawals from the Chinese border and put pressure on the Soviet ally <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to withdraw from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> after more than a decade of occupation. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said it will do so by Sept. 30. Those actions met <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s three conditions for a summit with the Soviet leader and moved closer to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s own goal of reducing international tension so he can focus on domestic economic problems. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> agreed to the summit almost grudgingly. When <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, the Soviet foreign minister, announced the date during a visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in February, the Chinese initially denied it and then issued a confirmation two days later. Ties between the two nations in trade, foreign policy and cultural exchange have become close in the past decade, but <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leaders say they have no intention of resuming the alliance. The main immediate value of the summit for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which is wary of an expansionist <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, has been the concessions on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Diplomatic sources said the Chinese were trying to extract new pledges even in the final weeks before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s arrival. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s withdrawal plan does not include a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force or establishment of an interim government to oversee elections. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is said to want both endorsed in the summit communique. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> seeks a general statement of principles guiding the relationship, like the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> Communique signed by President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> on his 1972 visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` It's not obligatory'' to mention <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in the communique, said V.V. <PERSON> Duhin </PERSON>, cultural counsellor at the Soviet Embassy. `` This document is designed for many years, and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is a problem of this year and next year.'' <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON>, Soviet deputy foreign minister, slipped into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> quietly in late April, hoping to resolve the matter. A Western diplomat described it as a `` game of chicken.'' Animosity and disagreement between the two countries have a long history. From the 17th century to the early 20th, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> contended for influence in the vast Asian interior. Soviet agents helped organize the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1921 and gave it assistance, but also tried to dictate strategy in a way that irked the revolutionaries, especially <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>. <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> thought little of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s plan for revolution in the countryside. The Soviet dictator continued recognizing the Nationalist Chinese government even as <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s peasant guerrilla army was sweeping to victory. Friction continued after the Stalin-Mao alliance of 1950. The Soviets insisted on special rights to ports and railways in northeastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in return for military and technological aid, embarrassing Chinese leaders who claimed to have ended foreign control. The split came in the early 1960s, after the Soviets refused to back <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in its 1959 border conflict with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, would not help recapture <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> from the Nationalists and scrubbed an agreement to help the Chinese build a nuclear bomb. A border dispute led to a brief but bloody clash in 1969. Pragmatism took precedence over ideology under <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> resumed trade and other non-political exchanges with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Both <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> like to be seen as international peacemakers, and both have serious economic and political problems at home. Restless nationalist groups in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have been demanding autonomy or independence. University students in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have demonstrated for democracy on an unprecedented scale. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> already has done away with <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s communes and shelved his theories of continuous class struggle. By meeting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is addressing one of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s last remaining legacies: the Chinese-Soviet estrangement that has affected the world political map for three decades.

<TEXT>
 Here is a chronology of major events in Chinese-Soviet relations since the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was established in 1949: _ October 1949: The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was the first foreign nation to recognize the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> led by <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> _ December 1949: <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> mades his first trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and was snubbed by <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who met the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> revolutionary only after <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> threatened to return home _ February 1950: After difficult negotiations, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> signed a friendship treaty _ 1955: The Soviets left <LOCATION> Dalian </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION>, which they had occupied since Wo _ February 1956: <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s speech criticizing <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who died in 1953, surprised and angered the Chinese They accused the Soviets of rerld War II. visionism. _ October 1957: The Soviets agreed to furnish <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with a sample atomic bomb The promise was retracted two years later after relations began to cool. _ 1958: <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to urge caution toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s conflict with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> over the offshore islands of <LOCATION> Quemoy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Matsu </LOCATION>, but was rebuffed _ October 1959: <PERSON> Khrushschev </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for the 10th anniversary of the People's Republic Talks with <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> went badly and ref the campaign, which began last year. Unlike the dozens of other national academies in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, the American Academy receives no direct government financing. It does apply for and receive some federal grants. `` The endowment was great when <PERSON> McKim </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderbilt </PERSON> and others put it together in the early 1900s and it was n't bad in the 1940s and 50s,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Connors </PERSON>, the new academy director. `` But as of the 70s and 80s it began to look very insignificant to the needs of the academy. After the drop in the dollar in 1985, it's been very hard for us to pay our bills.''. Keeping all the academy's fellows happy also has been difficult. They find the modest stipends for a year of study and work do not go far in one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most expensive cities. Stipends range from less than $ 6,000 to $ 11,000 plus a room, studio and daily meal at the academy. This year's literature fellow, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, said he would have stayed home had not the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION>, where he teaches, supplemented his stipend of about $ 8,000. A predecessor, novelist <PERSON> Padgett </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, left the academy early because he could not afford to stay. `` It's difficult to live on the stipend if you're alone, very difficult if you have a spouse and impossible if you have a family,'' said <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, 39, who brought his wife and child. Criticism from the outside also crops up now and then. There have been complaints, which <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> rejects, that the academy is isolated, overlooks <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in both senses of the word and is a clubby institute little known beyond the Janiculum. <PERSON> Connors </PERSON>, a 44-year-old art and architecture historian from <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, says he is trying to improve the financial and living conditions for fellows. He said the lowest stipend will be raised next year from $ 5,800 to $ 7,500 and he hopes to arrange apartment suites for families. Many fellows would like better food in the academy dining hall, which they say suits a college cafeteria more than a city renowned for cuisine, but most agree with <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> that the academy's benefits far outweigh the hardships. `` Aside from more money for the fellowships and higher quality of food, it's hard to know what the academy can do better,'' he said. `` Being in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> has affected me as a writer. Americans have a poor sense of history and you ca n't walk around <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> without being immersed in history. `` It's inspiring, drinking at a cafe where <PERSON> Goethe </PERSON> drank and standing in the cemetery where <PERSON> Keats </PERSON> is buried. ... There's no doubt I'll be writing about <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in one way or the other for many years to come.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuck </PERSON>, a 41-year-old painter from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he sometimes misses the razzle-dazzle <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> art scene but loves the soft Roman light. `` It's so different from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I have a studio with a huge skylight so I can paint in the daylight. I do n't know how I'll ever go back to artificial light. Each year, the academy selects about 25 fellows from 1,000 applicants. They are chosen by a jury of prominent artists and scholars in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on the basis of submitted works, proposed projects and interviews. A few resident and visiting scholars also stay at the academy for a few months to work on their own projects and counsel younger fellows. This year, they have included <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON>. Most fellows live and work in the main building, a palazzo of marble and faded red stucco built at the turn of the century. Academy directors and visitors normally live up the road at the <LOCATION> Villa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aurelia </LOCATION>, a 17th century palace in landscaped gardens and ilex trees that was <PERSON> Garibaldi </PERSON>'s headquarters during the battle with the French in 1849. The academy library, considered one of the world's finest for classical studies and archaeology, is open to the public and attracts many researchers. Fellows generally are left on their own to pursue their projects. There are no courses, exams or graduation ceremonies. In the spring, the artists have a public exhibit, the scholars give lectures and the composers present a concert.

 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> keeps a book about shipwrecks on a shelf of his sprawling, sparsely furnished office But to the head of the nation's biggest oil company, the worst shipwreck of all happened on his watch and now he's paying the price of public rebuke. The one-time petroleum engineer, who took over <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s helm in January 1987, has agonized over the image-beating the company has taken since an <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> supertanker hit a reef in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and spewed 250,000 barrels of gooey crude into pristine Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, the worst spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. Rightly or wrongly, the 60-year-old executive has been accused by critics of mismanaging the disaster from the start, particularly because he seemed to remain hidden from the press and public for a week afterward. While the nation awaited word from <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> about the spill on that Good Friday morning in March, the company chairman admits he was holed up at his house in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> suburb. `` I figured the best thing to do was stay by the phone. So I spent the day on the phone at home, basically,'' <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said in an interview in his spacious 51st-floor corner office in the Exxon tower in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. In fact, <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said, he had to convince himself not to rush to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to take charge after aides telephoned him with the news a few hours after the Exxon Valdez grounded on <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>. `` My first instinct is to become an operator. My first instinct on anything is to go,'' said <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON>. But he indicated, in retrospect, that may have been a mistake. `` I had some advice that did n't make a whole lot of sense,'' he said, adding, `` But I could have done anything. If I wanted to go to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> I mean I'll go.'' After consulting with company executives, <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said, he decided his presence in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> would detract from the critical first task of keeping the supertanker from leaking more oil. <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> inherited the chief executive suite at the 107-year-old company more than two years ago and is not well known to the outside world. A career <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> executive whose personal earnings topped $ 9 million last year, <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> says he is comfortable in the vast office. A 10-foot live ficus tree is the most prominent feature. A blue-jacketed book titled `` Ships and Shipwrecks'' leans on a shelf with a handful of others. `` I'm not much for decoration; I've been told that,'' he said, eyeing the bare walls. `` Everyone wants to decorate it for me.'' For the first time in his 37 years with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> has had to publicly defend himself and his company against what he calls `` deep and virulent attacks,'' something with which he is clearly uncomfortable. Attempting to convince an unbelieving public of the company's sincerity, he says, has become the most painful crisis of his executive career <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> was born and raised in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the fifth of six children. His father was a truck driver who worked in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and his mother a housewife, who held outside jobs during the Depression. After high school and a two-year stint in the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> went West to explore new territory. His journey ended at <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> where he got a degree in petroleum engineering in 1952. That same year he joined <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Since then he has served in a range of roles, including vice president and president before he became chairman and chief executive. But <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON>, whose hobbies include golf and fly fishing, said he never had big plans for himself. `` I wanted to get a job and make a pretty decent living and I never really aspired to doing much more than that,'' he said. <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said he believes fate has guided his career and will continue to do so. ` Sometimes you're not sure whether it's good or bad luck ... but there's been a lot of luck,'' the executive said. Despite his new role in the limelight <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> remains an enigma to many Wall Street security analysts who follow the company. `` This is the only company that analysts do n't get a chance to sit with the operating management,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knuettel </PERSON>, with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. As to where and how the company is moving, <PERSON> Knuettel </PERSON> said, `` frankly being so quiet it's rather difficult to make a judgment. He says many of his analyses are `` hit and miss.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> is `` quieter than the average.'' `` He's been a little less public about the company's plans. There have been less analyst meetings since he's been there,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> readily admits he's not the most effusive personality but dismisses accusations he has evaded the press or Wall Street scrutiny. `` I know I'm not, certainly not, flamboyant. I do n't believe I could carry that off. But I'm not hidden out,'' the chairman said.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> liked cornbread. And his second cousin five times removed says his illustrious ancestor must have passed the taste on to him. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON>, an R & amp; B musician from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, says he inherited from his great-great-great uncle, the 15th president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, not only his name but `` a lot of nice furniture,'' including a teak desk that was a gift from the King of <LOCATION> Siam </LOCATION>. `` The notion of public service'' was <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s legacy to his family, which today includes many teachers, says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Works </PERSON>, his great-great-great-great-great grandson and a Wall Street lawyer. The curator, the musician and the lawyer are among descendants of 39 former presidents _ all but <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ who will gather at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on Sunday for the bicentennial commemoration of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s presidential inauguration. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the Bicentennial of the Constitution said it would be the largest gathering ever of men and women with presidential bloodlines. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nissen </PERSON>, a freelance researcher, was the commission's official descendant hunter It took `` a lot of detective work,'' he says. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>'s family, for example, was particularly hard to locate. Phone calls to <PERSON> Buchanans </PERSON> listed in <LOCATION> Mercersberg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, where the president was born, first turned up the <LOCATION> Buchanan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inn </LOCATION> _ `` they asked if I wanted dinner'' _ and then <LOCATION> Buchanan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tomatoes </LOCATION> _ `` they grow hydroponic tomatoes,'' said <PERSON> Nissen </PERSON>. Eventually, he got in touch with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who is coming with his mother, <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, 69. `` It sounds like a whole lot of fun!'' said <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, 40. `` I've got my tux ready for the presidential ball and all the parades, and I chipped in with my sister to buy a new camera for my mother. The presidential descendants include stockbrokers, a high school student, company executives, lawyers, writers, a teacher and a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Some of them describe their ancestors' terms in office with glowing admiration, while others offer a more dispassionate appraisal. But all speak of their presidential forebears with pride. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fillmore </PERSON> <PERSON> Norfleet </PERSON>, 18, a senior at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christopher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and the great-great-great-great nephew of <PERSON> Millard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fillmore </PERSON>, recently studied the 13th president in his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history class. `` When you hear of <PERSON> Millard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fillmore </PERSON> you think of him as being an ineffective and mediocre person,'' said <PERSON> Norfleet </PERSON>, a football and lacrosse player, student council member and sports editor for the school newspaper. But he noted that <PERSON> Fillmore </PERSON> `` came from a very prestigious background, was a smart man, well-mannered and liked by a lot of people.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, 47, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stockbroker, spoke of the `` strength and foresight'' of his grandfather, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, which, he said, enabled him `` to develop policies which, although they may have seemed perhaps radical and at times severe and very unpopular, were vital for this country.'' He then tempered his words of praise with modesty. `` We were taught to be proud of the heritage and accomplishments of our grandparents but to never use these for personal advancement or gain,'' he said. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> IV, an assistant attorney general in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, was impressed with his great-great-great grandfather's `` honesty and patriotism. `` I do n't think he was the best president but I think he was up there with the better part of them,'' he added. His name sometimes prompts jokes, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said: `` ` I thought you were dead' or ` You're looking fine to be 200 years old.''' Can <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, the president of a chemical treatment company in <LOCATION> Ashland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, really be the grandson of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, the 10th president? <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> explains: `` My grandfather was 63 when <PERSON> Father </PERSON> was born in 1853. Then my father was 75 when I was born in 1928. So, it does add up.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, who had 15 children by two wives, set `` a presidential record that will never be broken,'' noted the descendant. `` He certainly was a family man.'' One of the most common sentiments expressed by the presidential descendants is regret that they do n't know more about their famous ancestors. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, 68, a vice president of an insurance company in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said as a young man he was embarrassed to ask his grandmother about his grandfather, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, the 23rd president who died in 1901. `` Sadly, I did n't talk to them,'' he said. One of the most distant of the presidential descendants to attend the bicentennial festivities is <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conger </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who is the second cousin five times removed of the man whose inauguration is being honored. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, <PERSON> Conger </PERSON>'s great-great-great-great grandmother, was the first cousin of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, who was <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s mother, explained <PERSON> Conger </PERSON>, curator of the diplomatic reception rooms at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and former curator of the White House. `` I consented rather reluctantly to go'' to the inaugural commemoration, he said. `` I felt someone with the name <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> might have been a better representative.'' But <PERSON> Conger </PERSON>, who is in his 70s, is well chosen; he is an expert on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s life, from important facts about his presidency to trivial insights into his private life. `` My mother was eminently interested in history,'' <PERSON> Conger </PERSON> said. `` My brother did n't like cornbread so, of course, I did n't. But my mother would say ` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> ate cornbread' and that meant the little Conger boys should eat it. `` I love cornbread now,'' he added.

 Spring has kissed central <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, and L.C. <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> once again is busy planting corn, peas, butter beans and okra. He's also hoping for a bumper watermelon crop this summer. `` I've got a plan,'' he says as he leans against his old <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> tractor. `` If it works out, I'm going to get my watermelons on the market two or three weeks earlier than anybody else and I'll clean up.'' <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION>, a friendly man with a wiry build, becomes excited as he talks about his crops and the 43-acre `` dream farm'' where he and his family once worked as field hands. However, this could be the last spring for his dream, and for a lot of other dreams like his. At 33, L.C. <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION> is a young, black farmer. And, as such he's twice as likely to lose his land as his white counterpart In 1910, the nation's 950,000 black farmers comprised 14 percent of all farmers in this country. Now, the remaining 35,000 make up just 1.6 percent of the 2.3 million farmers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, the number of black farms declined by 42 percent between 1978 and 1982. White farms fell by only 2.4 percent during the same period. `` Unless this trend is reversed, there will be no more black farmers in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by the year 2,000.'' This dire prediction is contained in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s 1982 report on the `` Decline of Black Farmers in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Yet, while there's just a relative handful of young, black farmers still operating _ the current, median age for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> black farmers is 60 _ the federal government is trying to force L.C. <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> off his land. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Farmer </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has given him notice to vacate the premises because he's behind on his loan. But we're telling him to stay put and fight,'' says <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Paris </PERSON><PERSON> , </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a field coordinator for the private, non-profit Federation of Southern Cooperatives <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> bought his farm, which includes a large pond and five-acre pecan orchard, at an <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> auction in 1985. He bid $ 36,500, borrowing $ 31,000 from the government. `` My annual payment is $ 3,800,'' he said. `` I fell behind the second year. Now, I've got the money to make the payment but the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> wants the whole $ 30,000.'' <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said he's heard that a wealthy white landowner, whose bid was $ 10,000 lower than Crosby's, covets the property. `` It's the same old story,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> is slowly changing but basically, at the local level, quite often its still a bunch of good ol' white boys who look after each other.'' <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' father, who worked for the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> for nearly 30 years and was one of the first black men ever to serve as an assistant county supervisor, agrees with this assessment. `` It was tragic. Blacks always got the last and the least,'' said the elder <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, adding that he saw hundreds of black Alabamians lose their farms during the 30 years he workd for the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION>. `` I remember one time back, in the'60s, I was told, outright, by a white <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> committee member in <LOCATION> Bullock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, that a black farmer had been denied a loan because he was ` shooting off his mouth about civil rights.''' Under the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION>'s loan procedure, a county supervisor makes a recommendation to a three-member county loan committee, which then either approves or denies the loan. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a 73-year-old farmer in the Mt. Zion community, near <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, was the first black ever to serve on an <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> county committee. In this country, the average black-owned farm contains fewer than 100 acres, compared with an average of 440 acres for all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farms. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> own 500 acres, which they slowly acquired over the past 40 years, parcel by parcel. `` My grandfather came to this area at age 12, shortly after he was freed from slavery,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` He never owned land, being a cash renter, but I've found that, for a black man in this country, there is no greater security, nor better avenue to independence, than farming.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who said he and his four brothers pooled their resources and `` pulled together toward a common objective,'' acknowledged he is worried and saddened that this generation of young blacks is n't going into agriculture. `` After the Civil War, the federal government promised the freed blacks 40 acres and a mule but hardly any of them got it,'' he said. `` Our people should realize by now that they've got to help themselves; nobody's going to do it for them. `` I'm very concerned that young blacks are turning their backs on farming, at a time when life in the cities is getting worse every day.'' The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit advocacy group based in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, estimates there now are fewer than 200 full-time black farmers, aged 25 or under, in the entire country. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who say they are getting 25 percent fewer agriculture students than they did 20 years ago, blame farming's poor image and the enormous difficulty young blacks face in amassing capital. The continuing phenomenon of black land loss was the topic at a recent meeting sponsored by the university and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>. `` Greed and institutional racism'' are the major reasons blacks have been forced out of farming said the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooks </PERSON>, director of the church's <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homeland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION>, in his keynote address at the conference in <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. In its report, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> found that blacks were being ill-served by the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s agency designed specifically to help poor farmers. The commission, noting that black farmers _ 90 percent of whom are in the South _ often are unable to deal with the ever more complex federal loan programs. The commission called for serious government intervention. Last July, as part of an omnibus farm bill passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> launched its `` Socially Disadvantaged Outreach Farm Ownership Program.'' `` So far,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kegley </PERSON>, `` we have made 58 loans to minority farmers under the program.'' He said the loans, totalling $ 4.6 million, are to finance farm purchases for poor blacks and other minorities. `` We recognize the problems of the past and we're working on them at all levels,'' <PERSON> Kegley </PERSON> said. `` Since 1984 the percentage of <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> loans to blacks has been steadily increasing.'' He acknowledged, when asked, however, that only 91 of the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,849 county supervisors are black In <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, the state with the most black farmers, eight of the 82 county supervisors are black. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, it's only three of 79. <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> officials in those states say they have had little luck recruiting qualified blacks because the goverment pay scale is n't competitive

 In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, however, eight of 57 county supervisors are black, two of seven district supervisors are black and 49 of 203 county committee members are black. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Paris </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> must make such across-the-board efforts in every state if black farmers are to have an equal chance to survive. The new <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> minority funding outreach program does little, he said, to help many of those black farmers already indebted to the federal government. `` If they really want to help black farmers they should forgive their past debts and let them start over,'' he added. `` Lord knows the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> has done little enough in the past to help small farmers.'' <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' organization is in the forefront of the effort to help black farmers stay on the land. The federation offers counseling in crop planning and farm management. It also helps poor farmers, black and white, wade through the intracacies of the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> loan and appeal procedures. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennick </PERSON>, who heads the federation's Land Assistance Fund, has helped draft a proposed `` Minority Farmer's Act'' that would provide emergency aid. Among other things, it would create a special agency within the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to deal with concerns of minority farmers and develop a special debt restructuring program for farmers who are less than $ 100,000 in hock to the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION>. `` We hope to get the bill introduced this fall or early next year,'' <PERSON> Pinnock </PERSON> said. `` The black congressional caucus is planning to push it. We also have assurances of support support from some white congressmen.'' Black farmers such as L.C. <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION>, meanwhile, are hanging on by a slender thread. For others, such as <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pigford </PERSON>, a ruined third-generation farmer from <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, the thread has snapped. `` I have n't farmed since 1984, the year the hurricane blew through here,'' said <PERSON> Pigford </PERSON>, who now works in a factory. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> never would loan me enough money to buy a farm, just enough to rent out land to farm. But the hurricane ruined me and now the government is trying to take my house.'' <PERSON> Pigford </PERSON>, who testified in 1984 before a congressional committee investigating the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION>'s lending practices, added that he thinks his chances are slim of ever getting back onto a tractor seat. Another young farmer, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ammans </PERSON>, who raises turkeys at <LOCATION> Kenansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, says whites should n't think that black farmers are just looking for free handouts. `` Like bald eagles I'm a member of an endangered species,'' he said. `` If the government is willing to help eagles, it oughta be willing to help me. All I want is a chance to survive.''

 The government said consumer spending rose a slim 0.2 percent in March, its weakest performance in six months and a sign, analysts said, that consumers are contributing to an economic slowdown.

That combination boosted the personal savings rate to its highest level in nearly four years, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The government also reported that the prices Americans paid for imported goods rose 1.7 percent in the first quarter, largely reflecting a surge in the cost of crude oil from abroad.

<HEAD>Regulators: Drexel State Settlements Will Be Delayed</HEAD>

 Roadblocks in the settlement of criminal fraud charges against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will delay states from levying fines and stripping the investment firm's brokerage licenses, state securities officials say. Nevertheless, lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> have met with regulators in all 50 states to try to smooth a wave of expected punitive action against the brokerage house at the center of Wall Street's ongoing criminal scandals, the regulators said. State securities laws bar convicted or admitted felons from operating in the securities industry. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to plead guilty to six crimes to resolve a range of fraud charges brought by the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office. But legal challenges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to the federal judge who must approve the criminal pact and the separate settlement with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> are delaying resolution indefinitely. Until <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> formally enters a plea, states are powerless to try to punish <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. `` The states ca n't do anything until there is an order issued on some sort,'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>'s securities administrator, who heads a panel of state regulators examining <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. But, she added, `` It probably will mean states will start negotiating a settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> even though there is no order yet.'' The state officials met privately to discuss <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> during a conference of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week. Officials said they are studying punitive measures against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, including fines, suspensions and broad supervision, and concessions that would permit the firm to retain brokers and do business, such as municipal bonds, with towns and cities. States do n't have to prove any individual investors bought stock in companies tied to the frauds alleged by the government in its settlements with the firm, but there is broad belief that citizens in all states were affected. In addition to the legal challenge to the impartiality of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, regulators predict that indicted <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> bond salesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> will try to block release of internal company documents that state officials may seek to obtain. While <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to cooperate with the states, if <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> succeeds in freezing documents, state action could be further delayed, said G.W. <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION>, assistant enforcement commissioner in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. Regulators said they plan to let class-action suits cover claims by investors who say they were defrauded by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s actions. About 12 such suits have been filed around the nation to date, in states including <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> remains a registered broker but has no offices, could strip the firm's license to do business and levy fines _ $ 10,000 per violation. The amount is dwarfed by the $ 650 million the firm has agreed to pay the federal government. `` If they're out of the retail business in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> it may not be significant,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s top securities official. `` But if <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> revokes their license, that would be a big problem.'' But <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has moved to avoid losing its license by selling about half of its 43-office retail brokerage network _ which deals directly with individual investors _ to <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The rest of the department is still on the auction block. Some state regulators said they would follow the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s lead; since the commission did not strip <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s license, they feel the states should n't take superceding action. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, home to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s high-yield junk bond division that does hundreds of millions of dollars in business, has an insider-trading statute similar to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s and could bar certain <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employees and restrain its business if it can trace parts of the alleged frauds back to the state. But some regulators said they would consider the broad nature of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> pact, which places <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> under unprecedented supervision for three years, when they take action. In addition, banishing <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, for example, would take a huge chunk out of the state's securities industry. `` To the extent that they cleaned up their overall act, we have to take that into account,'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> said. Added <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, securities director for <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>: `` They paid their pound of flesh, there are class action suits out there. Why should I stab the dead?''

 <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it had completed its $ 3.2 billion tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and has accepted payment for about 81 percent of outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> shares. The buyout puts an end to a rival bid from <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. All the natural gas companies are based in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Preliminary results indicate that about 57 million <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> shares were validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the midnight Wednesday expiration of <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s offer. <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s offer included provisions to buy up to 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 60.8 million outstanding shares and a stock exchange at the same $ 53-per-share value for the remaining shares. The combination of the two companies will create a 27,000-mile system _ one of the nation's largest pipeline companies in terms of miles. The battle for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> began Jan. 16 when Coastal announced its surprise takeover bid.

<HEAD>Channel One Schools Wait To See Ad-Free Turner Program</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two of the principals whose schools were part of Whittle Communications' test of a commercially-sponsored news show for teens are taking a wait-and-see approach to the prospect of a rival, ad-free service. The comments Thursday followed cable executive <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s announcement that he planned to launch a daily news show for schools in August The service resembles Whittle's Channel One program, which recently completed a test run at six schools. But <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s program will contain no advertising while Channel One does. `` I do n't know anything about the quality of the -LRB- Turner -RRB- programming,'' said <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinskas </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Eisenhower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> `` Rex'' <PERSON> Stooksbury </PERSON>, principal at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Whittle </LOCATION>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, also said he did n't want to take a position on the <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> proposal before seeing the program `` I do n't want to close the door on any innovations that might enhance our students' education, but I ca n't compare the two because I have n't seen his program yet,'' he said. Channel One, a daily 12-minute news show aimed at teens, was tested at <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, Central and four other schools over a seven-week period ended last Friday. Each program contained two minutes of commercials for jeans, sneakers, candy and other products. The advertising sparked complaints from national education groups, which said Whittle should not be allowed to sell a captive student audience to big business. <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said the ads are needed to pay for the video recorders, TV monitors in every classroom and satellite dishes that it gave each of the participating schools so they could show the program schoolwide every day. The company is evaluating the test results to determine whether to expand the program nationally in the fall of 1990. But <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he would start producing a 15-minute news show for schools on Aug. 14 and run it on his <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> in the early morning hours each school day so teachers could record it for later use in class. He said the program, <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsroom </ORGANIZATION>, would carry no advertising, a move that some cable industry insiders said could undercut support for Whittle's ad-supported show and reassert <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s prominence in cable programming. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said he expected local cable operators would support his program by making free cable connections to high schools and help see that every school got a chance to receive the show. <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Jasinskas </PERSON> said <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s approach `` sounds like a very interesting idea'' and said he would be open-minded about it. But he said the importance of giving schools equipment on the scale of the Channel One program should not be underestimated when comparing the Whittle and Turner offerings. <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> <PERSON> High </PERSON> was given 40 television sets and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> got 70 from Channel One, and the principals said the schools might not have otherwise obtained them. Central High's <PERSON> Stooksbury </PERSON> said his school had no problems with the Channel One commercials anyway, and teachers and students miss having the program.

 Another court battle involving <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> shaped up when state Commerce Commissioner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> ordered <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> shareholders of the airline's parent not to sell their shares to hostile suitor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, who is representing <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, said he planned to file a lawsuit today in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> asking a judge to vacate the order issued Thursday by <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>. In a related development, a vote on a state anti-takeover bill aimed at placing roadblocks in the way of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> suitors was delayed by legislators' questions about the constitutionality of the measure. Under <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s existing anti-takeover law, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> can block a securities offer within the state under certain conditions. His order prevents the estimated 1,900 shareholders of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in the state from selling their 1.3 million shares to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, whose offer of $ 2.7 billion, or $ 90 a share, has been rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> said Thursday the airline holding company is aware of or four friendly potential suitors, but would not identify them. He said a management-led buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's fourth-largest carrier, is not in the works. <ORGANIZATION> Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the company <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> set up to bid for <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>'s suspension of its bid in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> `` will only serve to disadvantage and inconvenience'' <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> stockholders, who can sell their shares only in the open market at a discount. But <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said the order could hamper <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' ability to negotiate loans to finance the purchase. `` The practical effect is that lenders do n't like to make loans to people who are in violation of securities laws,'' he said. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said he would consider lifting the suspension at any time if the billionaire oilman disclosed more details of his plan for running the airline. The additional details which <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> supplied Thursday did not satisfy his request, he said. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> is asking <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> to explain how he will operate the carrier, based in suburban <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>, without layoffs or cutbacks in light of the major debt load he would incur through the takeover. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has denied he would make such cutbacks. <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> maintained that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Acquisition </PERSON>'s original financial disclosure statement was sufficient under the state's anti-takeover law. With additional information supplied at a Tuesday hearing and on Thursday, <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> more than fully satisfied the law's disclosure requirements No more disclosures will be made because that `` would require getting into confidential, proprietary information that would put us at a severe disadvantage vis-a-vis other bidders,'' <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said. The information submitted Thursday concerned <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' intention to substantially increase the capacity of passenger-seat miles over the next six years, <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said. Additionally, the information said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> intends to enhance the utilization of the aircraft's fleet by improving scheduling, he said. On another front Thursday, the chairman of the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Spear </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, said he would give the anti-takeover bill another hearing due to the concerns about constitutionality. The bill includes provisions that would: _ Prevent a corporate raider from financing a takeover of a company with a substantial connection to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> by selling the company's assets _ Give the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> power to approve an acquisition of a major tenant of Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, such as _ Impose a state excise tax on `` golden parachutes,'' the large severance payments corporate executives receive if they are fired or leave their jobs after their company is bought Also Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaughlin </PERSON> extended until May 11 his temporary restraining order prohibiting <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> from `` disrupting'' contracts or contract negotiations at <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. The order had been scheduled to expire Thursday.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> wants to lease 14 planes to rival <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> as it begins its newly announced restructuring plan. The $ 96.6 million, five-year lease would give <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> an option to extend the lease or to buy the 727-200 planes at a price to be negotiated, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said Thursday. The agreement must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which has had oversight of such deals since strike-torn Eastern filed March 9 for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. `` We had indicated we would be raising about $ 1.8 billion through assets sales,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said. `` This is certainly the first step in this direction for the new, reduced-size airline.'' Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> described the planned restructuring of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, after parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> ruled out a sale of Eastern. Bakes said Eastern would rebuild with a smaller airline and address its debts by slashing service by 29 percent and selling $ 1.8 billion worth of assets. Eastern's unions, on strike since March 4, continue to hope the bankruptcy court and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors will call for sale of the airline. Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> has set a Wednesday hearing on why Eastern should n't be sold in its entirety to the highest bidder. Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said there was considerable industry interest in Eastern assets such as planes, gates and routes and that the beleaguered company was receiving good offers. `` There's a tremendous demand right now for airplanes by other carriers that are expanding,'' she said. `` The delivery positions and orders are backed up in the factories.'' She said she did n't have any information on other assets sales in the works, but added: `` ... there have been many interested parties. Obviously, there are going to be other transactions.'' Eastern's restructuring plan calls for a fleet of 157 aircraft. If the 14 149-seat 727 planes are leased to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> at $ 115,000 a month and another 21 of the 727 planes are sold to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> in the planned <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle sale, that would leave Eastern with 60 other `` excess aircraft for sale or long-term lease,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said. Pilots union spokesman <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said the unions oppose any transfer of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets while hoping the bankruptcy court will approve a buyout of the company. `` They can make all the plans they want,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said. `` I think they neglect to tell the people they must get approval from the bankruptcy court. That's a fairly lengthy process and it's not going to happen overnight.'' The $ 365 million shuttle service sale also awaits approval by the court, <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge has dealt a defeat to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, ordering arbitration in a dispute over seniority between pilots for subsidiaries <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> in early 1987 and merged it into <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, creating the problem of how to combine pilot seniority lists. Pilots for <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, which had been based in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, sued <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here, alleging that the Houston-based airline company reneged on its promise to fairly combine the lists or turn to arbitration. The promise had been a key part of the labor protection agreement included in the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air-People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> deal. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Politan </PERSON> heard three days of testimony, including that of <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> founder and former chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>, before ruling Monday. <PERSON> Politan </PERSON> found that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> had `` decimated'' its own case through vague and inconclusive testimony. The judge rejected an argument by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> that the labor protection agreement submitted to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> was unsigned and therefore not in force. He ordered both sides to submit court papers next week outlining how the arbitration should be conducted. The issue of seniority is crucial to the 750 former <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> pilots still with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and the 3,500 other <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> pilots. It determines pay, flight schedules, vacation schedules, where the pilots fly out of and the types of planes they fly, among other factors.

<HEAD>MCI Announces Cheaper Off-Hours Calling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has unveiled a plan that allows residential phone users to make an hour of interstate long-distance calls, beginning at 7 p.m. weeknights, anywhere in the country for $ 8 a month. Effective May 1, subscribers to the <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Primetime </ORGANIZATION> plan announced Thursday will get to make calls from 7 p.m. until 8 a.m. the following day, all day Saturdays and Sundays until 5 p.m. at $ 8 an hour and $ 6.80 for each additional hour. After the first hour, partial hours would be billed on a pro-rated, per-minute basis. Callers also would get a 10 percent discount for calls made at other times. A companion plan, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> Supersaver, allows customers to make interstate calls all day Saturday at $ 5 an hour. The company said the Supersaver plan is the lowest-priced calling plan ever offered by any major long-distance company. Neither plan applies to calls inside one state. `` It's the first to package the convenience and savings of <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> long-distance in plans designed for when most consumers make their calls,'' <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. `` You pay for the time _ the distance is free,'' said <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> vice president for consumer sales.

<HEAD>Treasury Says South Korea and Taiwan Should Do More on Currencies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> need to do more to allow their currencies to rise in relation to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar as a way of lowering huge trade surpluses the two nations are running with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to a government report. The report the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday followed six months of negotiations the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has held with both countries. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been pressuring the nations to allow their currencies to rise in value in relation to the dollar as a way of making their products more expensive on American markets and making <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods cheaper in their markets. While saying that both nations have made some progress in boosting the value of their currencies, the report contended that much more needs to be done. The department said it would press forward with the negotiations in the hope of achieving further progress. The negative findings were likely to increase pressure on the two governments in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where lawmakers have long been unhappy with the trade practices of the two nations. Last October, an initial <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> report had singled out <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for `` manipulating'' their currencies to gain an unfair competitive advantage in world markets. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have for many years used part of the money earned through their trade surpluses to buy and sell currencies on the open market to have an impact on the price of their own currencies in relation to the dollar. By keeping their currencies from rising as much against the dollar as other currencies have, they have been able to keep the prices of their exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from rising. The practice has also made it harder for American industry to take advantage of a cheaper dollar in selling goods to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. In 1988, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had a merchandise trade deficit of $ 9.5 billion with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and $ 13 billion with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, meaning that the two countries accounted for 18 percent of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s total trade deficit last year. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Report to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on International Economic and Exchange Rate Policy,'' said that the assessment six months ago that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit would continue to improve this year had been clouded by recent developments, such as rising oil prices. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> did not forecast a new trade figure. However many private analysts fear that the trade deficit, which dropped dramatically in 1988 because of the decline of the value of the dollar against many major currencies, could even begin rising again unless the dollar fell further. The report was prepared under a provision of the Trade Act of 1988 which requires the administration to look for cases of currency manipulation by American competitors in world trade and to embark on bilateral negotiations to halt such practices.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> is cautiously optimistic about its economy, three bleak years after oil prices collapsed, teaching the small Nordic country that its oil wealth is neither infinite nor stable. `` The situation is better than expected. A budgeted 1989 current-account deficit of 11.1 billion kroner -LRB- $ 1.64 billion -RRB- may become a surplus,'' Finance Minister <PERSON> Gunnar </PERSON> <PERSON> Berge </PERSON> said in a state television interview. Tough government austerity measures, including wage controls, helped cut annual inflation to 4.3 percent in March from a 10.4 percent peak two years earlier. Belt-tightening, improved oil prices and strong markets for its metals, timber and shipping industries turned a $ 44.5 million first-quarter 1988 trade deficit into a $ 1.4 billion surplus this year, said officials. Experts expect <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s gross national product to expand 1.9 percent in 1989, an improvement on 1988's 0.7 percent rate but well off 1986's 4.2 percent figure. While <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s economy is performing better in some areas than its main trading partners', <PERSON> Bjoern </PERSON> <PERSON> Skogstad </PERSON> <PERSON> Aamo </PERSON>, the finance minister's deputy, warned that `` economic uncertainty is still genuine.'' The country's unemployment rate reached a postwar record _ it doubled in a year to about 4 percent last year _ as business bankruptcies soared from 1,426 in 1986 to 3,891 last year and consumer spending declined. The minority Labor Government, facing a Sept. 11 national election under its traditional slogan, `` Employment For All,'' has forwarded the most comprehensive jobs package in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s history. It also cut interest rates, which were hiked in 1987 to more than 20 percent for some consumer loans, to stimulate the nation's ailing construction, auto sales and other business This coastal nation of 4.2 million people was unprepared for oil's boom and bust when the 1969 discovery of rich offshore reserves brought prosperity, nearly full employment and eventually an overheated economy. In 1986, the 840,000 barrels of oil a day plus natural gas <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> pumped represented 43 percent of its exports. Today it is <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s second-largest oil exporter, after <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, at 1.4 million barrels a day, but low crude prices cut oil's share of 1988 exports to 35 percent. Oil wealth, relaxed credit and heavy private borrowing fanned an unprecented consumer spending spree, which was abruptly extinguished by low oil prices and high interest rates. `` <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> learned the painful lesson that easy oil money inflates wages and costs ... at the expense of its traditional industries' ability to compete internationally,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Halvorsen </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Oslo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> `` The idealists in business are being replaced by leaders whose goal is to turn a profit,'' he said. The business magazine <ORGANIZATION> Nordic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Outlook </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s non-oil exports have increased 6 percent a year since 1986, partly because `` the decline in domestic demand has forced manufacturers to focus on production for export. <PERSON> Berge </PERSON> said his 1990-1993 economic plan, due for parliamentary review in May, will shield <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> from unstable oil prices and dwindling petroleum reserves with an oil royalties trust, geared toward stimulating traditional industry and research and toward eliminating foreign debt by the year 2000. Any oil revenues exceeding 1989 budget estimates of $ 8.5 billion, based on $ 14 per barrel of oil, should go towards reducing <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s foreign debt, which stood at $ 17.5 billion in 1988, he said. The Oslo Stock Market recovered from the October 1987 global crash to set all-time records in April 1989, 10 percent above pre-crash levels.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar was stable in thin European trading today as the market settled down before a long holiday weekend. Gold prices were lower. Traders said they expected the dollar to stay in a narrow trading range unless the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> index of leading indicators, the only significant economic news to be announced today, turned out to be a surprise. Most traders expected the index, which was scheduled for release this afternoon, to show a drop in March of about 0.5 percent, following a decline of 0.3 percent in February. They said the dollar had appeared to have found a new trading range for the time being. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.6922, more expensive for buyers than $ 1.6905 late Thursday.

 Bond dealer <ORGANIZATION> Matthews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to settle civil fraud charges in connection with its underwriting of more than $ 1 billion in municipal bonds and the sale of 1.5 million shares of its own stock, the government said. Thursday's settlement with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> capped the first phase of an intense federal investigation into <ORGANIZATION> Matthews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s practices in selling municipal issues. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> officials said the `` investigation of related municipal securities matters is continuing.'' Without admitting or denying guilt, <ORGANIZATION> Matthews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, its president and chairman, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benoit </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, its chief financial officer, agreed to settle civil charges brought by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> that they violated anti-fraud and false-reporting provisions of federal securities laws. Under the settlement, Manhattan-based <ORGANIZATION> Matthews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> will give up its broker-dealer license and agree to avoid future securities violations. <PERSON> Benoit </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, will be barred from the securities business for at least four years and <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, will be barred for at least two years. The settlement, which remains subject to approval by a federal judge, was filed Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Two other men, <ORGANIZATION> Matthews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> executive vice president <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and outside counsel <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Altoff </PERSON>, 58, of Rye, were not parties to the settlement, and civil charges were filed against them, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> complaint charged that the four individuals and <ORGANIZATION> Matthews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> carried out a fraud scheme to underwrite tax-exempt municipal securities `` through a series of sham closings'' to retain favorable tax treatment. The complaint also charged that <ORGANIZATION> Matthews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> made false and misleading statements about the sham transactions to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and to the investing public when the firm sold 1.5 million shares of its common stock in August 1986. The charges in the government's case stem from 26 municipal bond deals in 1985 and 1986. The firm has been out of the bond underwriting business for more than two years since its legal troubles began. According to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s complaint, <ORGANIZATION> Matthews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, used worthless checks to `` buy'' 26 municipal bond issues totaling $ 1.32 billion in December 1985 and August 1986 before a federal tax loophole was closed, making the bonds less attractive to investors. `` No real purchase occurred and they missed the tax deadline,'' explained <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, senior counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. According to the complaint, he added, investors were not getting the tax-exempt municipal securities they thought they were buying. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundick </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant director of enforcement, noted, however, `` the commission is not making a determination as to taxability of interest on the bonds.'' That was up to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, he said, adding that the circumstances of the bond sales `` created increased risks concerning taxation which should have been disclosed'' to investors. The complaint charged that the worthless checks were kept out of normal banking channels and the bonds were warehoused through a banking concern on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Saipan </LOCATION> until <ORGANIZATION> Matthews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> sold them to the public. Last year a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> charged <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> with fraud, bribery and obstruction of justice. The case has since been transferred to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> case does not involve the firm's best-known deals, $ 380 million in issues underwritten for <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marianas </LOCATION> in 1984 and 1985, officials said. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> complaint charged that proceeds from 17 of the 26 bond issues were used to buy guaranteed investment contracts to ensure repayment of interest on the bonds, rather than for their stated purpose: to finance construction projects _ including low-income housing. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> officials would not comment on whether the projects were bogus from the start.

<HEAD>Japan's Current Account Surplus Shrinks In Fiscal 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s current account surplus shrank 8.9 percent in 1988, the second straight year in which the surplus in the broad trade measure has contracted, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Analysts said the decline, to $ 76.97 billion in fiscal 1988 from 1987's $ 84.47 billion, was an encouraging sign for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which is trying to reduce its trade imbalance to ease tensions with its trading partners. The current account is a comprehensive measurement of a nation's international trade flows and includes imports and exports of goods and services, earnings and expenditures on tourism, financial investments and other transactions The ministry said import growth outpaced export growth in the fiscal year, which ended March 31. Imports grew 23.3 percent to $ 171.83 billion from $ 139.40 billion the previous year, while exports rose 14.4 percent to $ 267.10 billion from $ 233.44 billion. Strong domestic demand for manufactured goods helped boost imports, ministry officials said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s current account surplus for March, announced at the same time, shrank to $ 6.32 billion from $ 8.33 billion a year earlier, the ministry said. The surplus was also smaller than February's $ 7.71 billion Both exports and imports in the current account balance are measured when contracts are settled, and are different from the customs-clearance trade statistics that the ministry announces separately each month. The ministry announcement did not include breakdowns of trade figures by country or region.

<HEAD>A Bull Market Comeback?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Did the great bull market on Wall Street secretly survive the crash of 1987? Has it now, as in some science-fiction movie sequel, crawled out of the disaster's rubble and begun to prowl the canyons of Wall Street once more? Those questions are being raised in many investors' minds as the rally in stock prices that began in the waning weeks of 1987 carries to new high after new high. As of late last week the Dow Jones industrial average stood nearly 700 points, or 40 percent, above its low on Black Monday Oct 19, 1987. A 40 percent rise in 18 months compares pretty favorably with many a past rally that earned the `` bull market'' stamp. As if to confirm its status, the economy has kept growing at a robust rate, showing scarcely any effects from a very scary financial event. But one prominent money manager contends that people who think this way might be falling into a dangerous trap. If you judge the stock market by price alone, the bull appears to have revived, concedes <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gailliot </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which manages assets totaling $ 37 billion. When you apply other traditional criteria, however, `` it does n't look at all like a bull market,'' <PERSON> Gailliot </PERSON> said in an interview In a bull market, he says, a broad array of stocks should be rising to keep pace with the narrow sample represented by the Dow Jones industrials. But that has n't been happening. While the averages have hit new post-crash highs, the number of individual stocks at new 52-week peaks has been unimpressive, he adds. `` Volume is not rising with price,'' he also observes. `` The rally to date continues to have the characteristics of a bear market rally. We expect a new low -LRB- below DJIA 1740 -RRB- in price before this bear market is over.'' For some time now <PERSON> Gailliot </PERSON>, like many other economists, has been predicting a recession that has yet to give any sign of showing up. What has confounded the forecasters, he says, has been persistent strength in spending by consumers, long since overextended by the usual yardsticks. Since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of economic activity, `` the consumer is the ` gorilla' of our economy,'' he observes. `` If you do n't get the consumer right, you do n't get the business cycle right.'' Consumers' ability to keep spending has been stretched in the 1980s, <PERSON> Gailliot </PERSON> says, by devices such as low - -LRB- or no - -RRB- rate auto financing and home equity lines of `` These are marvelous innovations that do nothing but let the consumer go farther out on the limb.'' At some point, he says, consumers will reach the stage where they want or are forced to retrench. `` When the gorilla decides how much is enough,'' he says, `` then you get a recession.''

 The stock market was mixed today, hesitating after Thursday's rally to new post-crash highs. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.38 to 2,421.37 in the first half hour of trading. But losers slightly outnumbered gainers in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 446 up, 519 down and 491 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 23.55 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported this morning that the index of leading economic indicators fell 0.7 percent in March, following a 0.3 percent decline the month before. The latest figure slightly exceeded the consensus estimate on Wall Street, and provided new evidence of the kind of slowing in business activity that many investors have been hoping for. Interest rates fell in the credit markets on the news. Analysts said the response in the stock market was muted, however, by some misgivings about the potential implications of the figures for corporate earnings. In addition, brokers said traders were a bit leery of chasing after a rally that has proceeded for more than a month with few interruptions. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> dropped -LCB- to 47 -RRB-. On Thursday the company reported higher first-quarter profits, but said its earnings for the full year might not equal the record total reported for 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks slipped .02 to 173.04. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was down .29 at 344.46. On Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average climbed 29.88 to 2,418.99. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, with 1,005 up, 464 down and 484 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 191.17 million shares, against 146.09 million in the previous session.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may subpoena <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials as part of its inquiry into why a popular program that subsidizes food exports has apparently been halted with no official notice. Though the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> denies that the Export Enhancement Program has been stopped, no sales using it have been completed since February. And lawmakers allege that a just-announced grain sale to the Soviets will be unsubsidized. `` Since the program started there has never been a two-month hiatus,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., who heads the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains The holdup appears to be with the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, where officials say a review of the program is taking place. When <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> representatives failed to appear before his subcommittee Thursday, <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> said he may have subpoena them. He said the administration's budget writers first would be given a chance to answer questions in writing, but would be expected to `` respond quickly and satisfactorily.'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON>, press secretary to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, said the program has slowed down because of weather and stock conditions and because there is a new administration, but it has not been suspended. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Scully </PERSON>, associate director for legislative affairs at <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>, said director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> could n't make the hearing because he had another obligation and no other policymaker at the budget office was qualified to speak. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, will be allowed to purchase 24 million metric tons of grain this year instead of the 20 million previously negotiated. Lawmakers said the additional sales will not be subsidized. Only wheat has been subsidized in the grain sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Huge amounts of corn have been sold to the Soviets without subsidies. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> also said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators concluded a two-day meeting about commodity purchases under a long-term grain agreement that specifies regular sales of grain and soybeans during the year. The pact calls for such meetings twice a year. In a separate announcement, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought an additional 150,000 tons of corn, which boosted total Soviet purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn to 13.4 million tons. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> also has bought 4 million tons of wheat for delivery through Sept. 30, the end of the agreement's sixth year. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviets also have bought 450,000 tons of soybeans, nearly 1.4 million tons of soybean meal and 507,400 tons of grain sorghum for 1988-89 delivery. But a member of <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>'s subcommittee said the Soviets went away from negotiations angry. The Soviets wanted to expand the amount to 30 million tons under the Export Enhancement Program, but were told their purchases would have to be unsubsidized, said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>. Attempts to contact Soviet officials at their embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were unsuccessful. <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON> said the agreement does not stipulate whether the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> will be used during the sale. She said the talks were about the amount of grain the Soviets could buy, not its price. The <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> was started four years ago to entice foreign buyers who were being lured away by countries that charged cheaper prices because of heavy government subsidies. Through the program, buyers are given bonus quantities of commodities if they buy a certain amount. The commodities come from the surplus stock purchased previously by the federal government from American farmers through other agricultural support programs. The fate of the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> has been in question since April 18 when <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, the foreign agriculture service administrator, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that the agriculture department must hold all new <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> initiatives until the program had been reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says that under the program $ 8 billion in farm products have been sold, including wheat, wheat flour, vegetable oil, barley, barley malt, semolina, sorghum, rice, poultry feed, dairy cattle, eggs and frozen poultry. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> considers the program vital to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strength during international trade negotiations, known as the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Round </LOCATION>, which have been going on in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position is that countries should remove or drastically reduce subsidies that distort world prices and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> believes that the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> puts the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a stronger bargaining position.

<HEAD>Black &amp; Decker Wins 95 Percent of Emhart Stock in Tender Offer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Decker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said today it received 95 percent of the stock of <ORGANIZATION> Emart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a tender offer, enough to complete a $ 2.8 billion takeover of the diversified manufaturing company. <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> offered Emart shareholders $ 40 a share for their stock. Based on a preliminary count today, about 95 percent of Emart's outstanding shares were tendered under the offer, which expired this morning. <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> will now authorize its banks to begin paying shareholders. Although <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> in effect comes under <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> control today, the actual merger will take about 60 days to complete, said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> spokeswoman. <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> shareholders who do not sell their stock to <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> will be able to get $ 40 a share once the merger is final. Black & amp; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> manufactures power tools and products for the home and commercial applications. <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> manufactures industrial and consumer products and information electronic systems. The company makes Kwik Set locks, True Temper tools, sporting goods, faucets, staplers, commercial hardware and footwear materials. <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> has said it plans to sell <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>'s electronics division, estimated to be worth $ 500 million, to help pay for the acquisition. Analysts say Black & amp; <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> should be able to handle the debt, but the company is not expected to turn a profit for about a year and a half. <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> had been fighting an unsolicited $ 2.4 billion takeover offer from <ORGANIZATION> Topper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based investment group that includes oil heir <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> real estate family of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 As the strike gripping <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> approaches the end of its second month, boss <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is hanging tough. After rejecting buyout proposals and producing his own plan to shrink the airline, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> seems to be playing a waiting game with striking employees, who after nearly two months on the picket lines may be under increasing pressure to find jobs again. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> also must contend with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors and with a federal bankruptcy judge, who must approve the downsizing plan and is pushing for a sale of Eastern in its entirety. `` It really continues to be a game of brinksmanship,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, an airline industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The strike has become the longest major walkout against a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline since the industry was deregulated in October 1978. After a 17-month wage dispute, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s militant Machinists struck the Miami-based carrier on March 4 and were joined by pilots and flight attendants, virtually grounding the airline. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, put <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors on March 9. Employees' hopes were stirred April 6 when a group led by ex-baseball commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> agreed to buy Eastern for $ 464 million. Hopes soared a few days later when the unions agreed to accept $ 210 million in wage concessions in exchange for a 30 percent stake in the carrier under the <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> deal. But the proposal collapsed over the unions' demand that a powerful trustee be appointed to replace <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> as head of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> before <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> took over _ a term the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> chief flatly rejected. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> now insists that a sale of Eastern in its entirety no longer is an option _ neither side will back down from their trustee positions _ although billionaire hotel executive <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and others have expressed buyout interest. Instead, the airline on Monday detailed plans to operate at one-third its pre-strike size and raise $ 1.8 billion by selling assets, including planes, airport gates and landing slots at unspecified locations. `` I think that was -LRB- <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s -RRB- intention all along,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, who follows the industry for <ORGANIZATION> Provident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. As a first step, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday that it plans to lease 14 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727-200s to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> for $ 96.6 million over five years, subject to bankruptcy court approval. Eastern is expected to announce more deals for leasing and selling aircraft in the coming days, according to sources close to the company. The plan is reminiscent of what <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> did with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in September 1983 After he put <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> into Chapter 11, he slashed the number of employees to around 4,000 from 12,500 and brought the airline out of bankruptcy protection as a non-union carrier. Now, due to 1985 amendments to the bankruptcy laws, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> would first have to negotiate further with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> unions and demonstrate that he had no alternative but to cut jobs. Some experts say <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s downsizing strategy could be aimed at luring back striking pilots, who would lose seniority if they took jobs at rival carriers. Under the plan, which would cut Eastern jobs from the pre-strike 31,200 to around 17,000, management reckons it would need about 1,700 pilots. The airline says it is hiring and training new pilots at the rate of around 200 a month. `` It's the airline version of voodoo economics,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots union. `` And it's also designed to intimidate the 3,300 Eastern pilots into abandoning the picket line and returning to work.'' Some observers say it may be difficult for <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> to convince creditors and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> that the airline will be able to recruit 1,700 pilots in a reasonable period of time. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zweibel </PERSON>, the lead attorney for the committee representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the panel would need about two weeks to form a judgment on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s plan. There are still rumblings about a possible sale of the entire airline. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> plans to hold a twice-postponed hearing next Wednesday on the issue of selling Eastern in its entirety, icluding its Northeast shuttle service the company already has agreed to sell to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 365 million. Union officials and financial advisers continue to screen potential bidders for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>; union sources said Thursday they have held discussions with five suitors they consider credible. The pilots union leadership told its members late Thursday that <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> has submitted his bid for the carrier and that <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has requested confidential financial information from the bankruptcy court as a prelude to making his buyout offer.

 The stock market turned downward today, running into resistance after Thursday's rally to new post-crash highs. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 29.88 points on Thursday, dropped back 8.80 to 2,410.19 by 11 a.m. today.

The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported this morning that the index of leading economic indicators fell 0.7 percent in March, following a 0.3 percent decline the month before. The latest figure slightly exceeded the consensus estimate on Wall Street, and provided new evidence of the kind of slowing in business activity that many investors have been hoping for. Interest rates fell in the credit markets on the news.

<TEXT>
 Reregulation is a real prospect facing the domestic airline industry if current trends continue unabated, an airline executive warned. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON>, chairman of Phoenix-based <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, painted a generally grim picture of the industry's future, with fewer owners meaning lessened competition and higher fares <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Aviation-Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s annual news conference Thursday that deregulation initially created a highly competitive industry with low fares and a robust growth rate. But he said competitive balance has been destroyed by the concentration of ownership. In addition, he said, entry barriers to gaining a market share such as sophisticated computer reservation systems, access to restricted airports such as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s National, and multibillion-dollar orders for new planes by the major airlines have made it even more difficult for the smaller carriers. `` If something is n't done, you've got an oligopoly with very high fares and little competition,'' <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said. That could create `` a groundswell of public opinion that could mean the industry could experience reregulation,'' he said. `` If the barrier-to-entry problems are not resolved, that will happen.'' <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said concern over the situation is starting to register in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but that it will take such things as `` even higher prices, and they're going to get a lot higher, and several major failures,'' to bring concerted reform efforts. The ongoing problems of strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, including unsuccessful sale efforts amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, are part of that, he added. `` It's riveting the attention of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on our industry right now,'' he said. <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said he does not think the airline will fly again. `` I'm not sure Eastern can be successful as a smaller company,'' he said. Eastern's management recently proposed a plan to rebuild as a smaller carrier and sell around $ 1.8 billion in assets. As for his own 5-year-old airline, <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said, `` We're not a buyer and we're not a seller. We certainly do n't think a hostile takeover would be possible. We're not a classic target.'' <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> posted a $ 10.07 million first-quarter profit on Wednesday, compared with a $ 16.32 million loss for the same period last year.

 Grain and soybean futures opened lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as a steady rain fell on areas of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. The rain has given rise to sentiment that the drought that has plagued the area is over. `` We've had the best rain in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> in two years,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` A lot of people are saying the drought is over, and that's what's been supporting us for a long time.'' Soybean prices also are being affected by word that a Brazilian dock strike is breaking up. Dockworkers gave their tentative approval to a court-ordered pay raise. Uncertainty over the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's position on continuing subsidized grain sales to foreign countries is putting pressure on wheat prices. In early trading, wheat was -RCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in May at $ 4.03 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 2.67 -LCB- a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 3 \ cents lower with May at $ 1.74 a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 8 cents lower with May at $ 7.23 a bushel Cattle prices were higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in early trading, while pork prices were mostly lower. Live cattle were .15 cent to .38 cent higher with June at 71.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent to .80 cent higher with May at 76.25 cents a pound; hogs were .27 cent lower to .05 cent higher with June at 46.80 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .02 cent to .32 cent lower with May at 32.05 cents a pound.

Trading in the company's stock on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> was to cease at the end of the day The completion of the deal that stunned Wall Street came a day after shareholders formally approved the buyout at a special meeting in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, Del. Company officials said about 85 percent of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s shares were voted in favor of the merger. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday that it would move its headquarters from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area by the end of the year so the food-and-tobacco giant can be in close contact with the financial community.

 The seven regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> phone companies would be allowed to manufacture telecommunications equipment and begin offering information services such as electronic yellow pages, computer data bases and home shopping and banking under a bill introduced in the House. The bill, co-sponsored Thursday by Reps. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, D-Wash., and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, would lift some restraints that were imposed on the companies when the Bell System was broken up by a federal consent decree in 1984 Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., introduced a non-binding resolution in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last year that called for allowing the Baby Bells back into manufacturing and information services, and it had 205 co-sponsors The <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies claim federal regulation is limiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> telecommunications competitiveness overseas and is depriving consumers of the latest in communications advances. `` Other countries are racing ahead with telecommunications research and development, but we stand with our hands tied behind our back,'' <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telesis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginn </PERSON> called the bill a `` milestone in the history of telecommunications policy'' and commended <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` for taking this first step toward bringing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers and businesses time-saving conveniences and competitive tools that other countries now enjoy.'' <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said lifting the restrictions was `` essential to the enhancement of competition in both domestic and global markets.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said it was `` a critically important step forward.'' <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> also hailed the bill, but said it also imposes restrictions `` that will further delay the wide availability of information services, including the provision of electronic publishing.'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedheim </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which would face heavy competition in electronic classified ads, said the bill `` would result in less _ not more _ information being provided to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> homes electronically.'' The Swift-Tauke measure includes provisions designed to protect consumers, and orders the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to assure compliance. The Bell companies must provide other information service providers with non-discriminatory access to their phone lines. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> must determine that a Bell company does not hold monopoly power over electronic publishing services such as electronic yellow pages or telephone exchange service in its area. It also limits revisions to the yellow pages to once a month for the first two years. The Bell companies could provide electronic publishing outside their service areas without restriction. The bill would supersede <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s oversight of the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Senn </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON> It would not apply to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, nor would it repeal restrictions on telephone companies from providing cable TV programming, <PERSON> Senn </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T has opposed the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies' entry into long-distance and manufacturing as long as they retain control over local phone networks. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T did n't think the bill was necessary because the consent decree was working <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> said it was `` startling'' that one part of the bill `` appears to exempt the telephone companies from antitrust law with respect to some of the activities they want to enter.'' `` The bill's attempts to prescribe certain safeguards against abuse in manufacturing and information services strike us as futile, given the bill's other provisions that would remove antitrust protections,'' <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> said. The bill also requires the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies to provide non-discriminatory procurement in the manufacture of telephone equipment, and bars the phone companies from using proceeds from regulated telephone service to subsidize information services or manufacturing, and vice versa. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> also must assure that telephone customers do not pay for failed information services or manufacturing ventures and that investment costs can not be assigned to phone customers unless the customers will benefit. The bill also requires the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to regulate any transfer of assets between enterprises or credit arrangements. The bill calls for unspecified penalties and fines for violations.

 Former Teamsters president <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> died today at his farm home after a lengthy bout with emphysema and heart problems. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 73, was released from federal prison in September after serving three years of a 10-year sentence for attempting to bribe a senator over trucking legislation. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> served as international president of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union from 1981-83. He was forced to resign as <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> chief after he and four co-defendants were convicted in December 1982 for trying to bribe former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> to influence trucking deregulation. Cannon was not charged in the case. Though he maintained his innocence during the 1982 trial, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> acknowledged his role in the conspiracy case during testimony in 1985 in a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> trial. He was cooperating with federal authorities investigating the mob in an attempt to have his own sentence reduced. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> testified that while he was a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> labor leader before his elevation to the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> presidency, he had been under the control of <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Civella </PERSON>, the reputed crime boss in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> at the time. He said he received payoffs of $ 1,500 a month from <PERSON> Civella </PERSON> for seven years until he became Teamsters president. He said <PERSON> Civella </PERSON>, who has since died, played a key role in his election to the union presidency. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> also testified by videotape in a federal court trial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> against mob fitures accused of fixing his election as <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> president, and that of his successor, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, who died last July. Three co-defendants were acquitted of that charge in May 1988, but convicted of unrelated charges.

 The <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> trial jury began its second week of deliberations Friday, yielding no signal on its progress: no notes, no words to the judge and no requests for clarifications or to rehear testimony. There also was no word on the jurors' intentions for a Saturday session. Last week, a day after receiving the case, the jury deliberated for 3 -LCB- hours in the morning, then took the rest of the weekend off. The jurors' schedule has not varied. It begins with their arrival from a downtown hotel at 8:20 a.m., then juice and pastry and a 9 a.m. start. At noon a caterer arrives with lunches chosen individually by each juror from a menu. On Friday, the order got mixed up _ the caterer delivered the wrong lunches _ and the jurors went back to work until 12:30 when the right food arrived. <PERSON> North </PERSON> took advantage of the jury's 9-to-4 pace on Thursday with a quick trip to deliver a speech to the Bankers Club of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, presumably for the same $ 20,000 - $ 25,000 fee he has received for other recent appearances The former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide spoke about traditional values and received a standing ovation, according to <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> members who heard his speech. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sophomore from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> North </PERSON> spoke highly of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the club's next scheduled guest, booked for September. Protesters picketed outside the club before the speech. `` We do n't care whether <PERSON> North </PERSON> sees us or not,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, organizer for the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're demonstrating against the Bankers -LRB- Club -RRB- for giving him $ 25,000 while there are homeless people in this city sleeping on the streets. The <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> did not disclose <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s fee. `` You're all a bunch of pro-communists'' shouted a well-dressed businessman at the demonstrators. The North jury has before it 12 criminal charges, most of which accuse North of lying or withholding information about his and the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>'s support for the guerrillas fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government. North is accused of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cover up his role in secretly assisting the Contras and lying to the attorney general about aspects of the diversion of funds to the Contras from the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales. He also faces charges that he accepted a $ 13,800 home security system and converted $ 4,300 in traveler's checks from a Contra leader to his own use. Meanwhile, a two-judge panel of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> rejected a petition by 10 news organizations seeking access to a stipulation that was presented to the jury at the end of the trial but not made available to the public. The appeals court sent the issue back to the judge in the North case for a hearing on national security issues involved, saying it can not make a decision without having such a record. The stipulation summarizes highly secret intelligence interceptions concerning a CIA-assisted November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. North's lawyers referred in closing arguments to the stipulation in an effort to show that knowledge about the operatiion was not limited to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> but was known widely among top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials.

 A $ 400 million blend of big-league filming and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> stargazing debuts Monday when <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s top entertainment resort opens the Disney-MGM Studios theme park, a 135-acre playground with diversions that range from do-it-yourself music videos to a 1950s sitcom set. The complex at <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> combines working movie-TV sound studios with backstage tours for the public, a mixed-media ride-through show and other special effects adventures. `` It is a theatrical environment that is very close to the original conception by <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said in an interview. `` It's been on the shelf since the 1940s and is the culmination of a company dream. This attraction is unlike anything else we have.'' It's all themed to the golden age of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> in the 1930s and 1940s, when tyrannical cigar-chomping moguls ran studios and art deco dominated the building scape. Mom, dad and the kids can walk through re-creations of palm-lined <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Grauman </PERSON>'s Chinese Theater, peek at movies under production, take a role in a television show, make their own music videos, get a screen test and rub elbows with the stars at the <LOCATION> Brown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION> restaurant. Movie and TV production began last summer with the `` Superboy'' syndicated TV series and parts of several large-screen films while construction continued on the tourist portion. The event was preceded by glitzy parties and previews that included a television special, a parade of famous Hollywood actors and actresses on the boulevard and live tapings of a mew `` <ORGANIZATION> Mickey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'' TV series. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunis </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attractions </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes bringing a bit of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> will reinvigorate the resort, already visited annually by an estimated 25 million people that reportedly pump about $ 2 billion into the area's economy `` We talked of doing a studio tour when <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> was alive,'' said <PERSON> Nunis </PERSON>. `` We've wanted to do this for a long, long time. It's a dream come true.'' Disney will get a year's jump on some formidable competition in the high-stakes family entertainment business, in which the company founded by the late cartoonist has emerged as one of the undisputed leaders. <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> is building a rival $ 500 million complex to be finished next May. Just a few miles away, Universal is billed as the nation's largest working studio outside of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> Movie and TV production already is under way at the 440-acre facility owned by <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Universal will feature what it calls a `` total experience'' of Hollywood-style filmmaking to the public, making the visitor a participant in the action. It expects to attract up to 6 million visitors a year. Despite their well-publicized rivalry, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> officials insist the competition is good for each other as well as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where family-oriented entertainment has become one of the dominant industries. `` We've always had competition _ from <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Busch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION> and Baseball and many others,'' <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> said. `` We welcome competition. It's good for <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Disney does things in its own way, and we feel comfortable that we will have our niche in the community.'' The Disney-MGM theme park is the centerpiece of a $ 1 billion-plus renaissance of the 27,400-acre resort in the pine woods and citrus groves of central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, once populated largely by alligators and armadillos before it opened 18 years ago. Not that a rebirth is needed. `` We're having a phenomenal year in both -LRB- hotel -RRB- occupancy and -LRB- theme park -RRB- attendance,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> publicist <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>. After achieving a record $ 3.4 billion in revenues and $ 522 million in profits in fiscal 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> has on tap a number of `` openings'' at its <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> resort this year besides the studios. On schedule to open this fall is part of what it calls the largest convention-hotel complex in the Southeast. Making their debut this summer will be Typhoon Lagoon -LRB- `` the world's largest water park'' -RRB- and the <LOCATION> Pleasure </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> nighttime entertainment district. Built for the teen-age crowd, <PERSON> Nunis </PERSON> says Typhoon Lagoon will make all other water attractions as obsolete as <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> made amusement parks in 1955. `` We're finally going to be able to make waves,'' says <PERSON> Nunis </PERSON>. `` Surfing, a 100-foot mountain, a saltwater snorkling reef, including sharks and other live critters -LRB- in an enclosed area -RRB-. I can hardly wait to put on my bathing suit.'' Pleasure Island is for those who still have energy left at the end of an exhausting day at the Disney-MGM Studios park, <LOCATION> Epcot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION> or the Magic Kingdom. The complex of restaurants, shops and nightclubs is built on a six-acre island at the Disney Village. Opening this fall is the 770-room Swan Hotel, which along with the larger <ORGANIZATION> Dolphin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> will form the lodging side of the convention-hotel complex near <LOCATION> Epcot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>. The 1,500-room Dolphin is to open in July 1990. The more modestly priced Caribbean Beach Resort hotel opens an additional 800 rooms this summer for a total of 2,112. The 907-room Grand Floridian Beach Resort, a luxury Victorian-style hotel, opened last summer. Also set for completion this fall will be a new Epcot pavilion, the Wonders of Life, featuring a simulated ride through the human bloodstream and a movie that takes a viewer from conception through birth. All Disney's doings are coming together during a busy start for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> tourism this year. More than 3.4 million tourists visited the state in January, an 18.6 percent increase over the first month of 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> says. State tourism officials predict the number of visitors will increase 6 percent this year. That means the state would host 38.7 million tourists, vs. 36.6 million in 1988. Disney's <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> attributes the improved season to a generally strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy and a larger number of foreign tourists. For local Floridians, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s building spree is one of the main economic engines providing jobs. One of <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s most-popular spots is the employment office, currently hiring 2,500 new workers at a minimum pay of $ 5 an hour to help staff new attractions that will swell the Disney complex's workforce to about 28,000, nearly twice the level of eight years ago The new attractions also have prompted a $ 1 increase in one-day admission prices at the Magic Kingdom and Epcot Center and the introduction of a new four-day passport good at any of the three theme parks, effective Monday. The new ticket will cost $ 94 for adults and $ 77 for children 3 to 9 years old. It provides unlimited admission to the three parks for four days. New single-day admission prices for any one park will be $ 29 for adults and $ 23 for children.

 <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION>, the European consumer products conglomerate, Friday said it dropped its plan to purchase the Faberge and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Arden </PERSON> lines of toiletries, cosmetics and fragrances for $ 1.55 billion from <ORGANIZATION> Riklis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Negotiations on a definitive pact broke down because the <PERSON> Riklis </PERSON> group sought `` significant changes in the structure and terms of the transaction which would have involved <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> in substantial additional costs,'' according to an announcement from <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arm of the British-Dutch household and consumer products giant. The proposed all-cash acquisition from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Meshulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Riklis </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Riklis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had been approved in principle on Feb. 10. Details of a formal agreement had been expected to be worked out during talks that were to be concluded within 90 days. `` At the agreed price the acquisition of Faberge and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Arden </PERSON> would have been an important step forward in our strategy for personal products,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. `` They now appear to be available only with a construction and price which do not represent reasonable value to our shareholders.'' <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lustig </PERSON> declined to disclose the <PERSON> Riklis </PERSON> demands, saying he was prohibited from doing so by a confidentiality agreement. The <PERSON> Riklis </PERSON> group also refused to comment. Under the February agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> was to buy all of <ORGANIZATION> Faberge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> except for the <ORGANIZATION> McGregor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apparel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which comprises clothing lines such as Botany 500, Wonderknit and <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> the Kid. Among some of the name brands of Faberge and of its independent subsidiary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Arden </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> would have gotten were Visible Difference, <PERSON> Chloe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Lagerfeld </LOCATION>, Flawless Finish, Aqua Net and <PERSON> Brut </PERSON>. It had been expected that as part of the acquisition <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> would gain the <ORGANIZATION> Faberge </ORGANIZATION> name and <ORGANIZATION> Faberge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> would switch its name to <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON>. It had not been specified whether the Faberge and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Arden </PERSON> lines would be folded into Uniliver's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> division or its British or Dutch companies called <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION>, respectively. <PERSON> Faberge </PERSON> was bought by the <PERSON> Riklis </PERSON> group in 1984 for about $ 180 million. The holding company acquired <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Arden </PERSON> for $ 700 million at the end of 1987. Other <PERSON> Riklis </PERSON> holdings include <ORGANIZATION> Samsonite </ORGANIZATION> luggage and <ORGANIZATION> Culligan </ORGANIZATION> water softeners. Through acquisitions and internal growth, <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> for several years has been building its personal products operations around the world. It has targeted several segments of the market for further expansion, among them the prestige end of the fragrance and beauty aid business. Two years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> Chesebrough-Pond </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3.1 billion, thereby acquiring many widely known personal-care products, including several prestige, or expensive, lines such as the Prince <PERSON> Matchabelli </PERSON> fragrance collection. <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> also owns <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s Passion scents. <PERSON> Lustig </PERSON> said the prestige portion of the personal products business appeals to <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION> because it has been growing strongly and has not been fully exploited, particularly in the Far East and other parts of the world. Prestige items account for an estimated $ 8 billion, or 20 percent, of the overall personal products market.

 Wheat futures prices closed sharply higher Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as speculation continued on what position the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will take on whether to continue subsidized grain sales to foreign countries. Corn futures were lower, oat futures rose and soybeans fell as rains continued in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Wheat prices climbed as word spread of a second <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic policy committee meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on the issue of subsidized grain sales. `` Everyone is waiting to hear a final decision,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Wheat is more a political market than a drought market.'' The Export Enhancement Program was begun several years ago as a means of reducing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain stockpiles, but stocks were drained to such low levels last year that some officials want to end the program. Soybeans were pushed lower by word that the Brazilian dock strike was breaking up after dockworkers gave their tentative approval to a court-ordered pay raise. Corn prices were affected by heavy rains in the Corn Belt. At the close, wheat was 4 -LCB- cents to 12 -LCB- cents higher, with the contract for delivery in May at $ 4.17 -LCB- cents a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents lower to -RCB- cent higher with May at $ 2.69 -LCB- a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 3 cents higher with May at $ 1.78 a bushel; soybeans were 2 -RCB- cents to 7 cents lower with May at $ 7.22 -LCB- a bushel.

 <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday its first-quarter profit rose 31.7 percent, but would have fallen 8 percent if not for a one-time gain from an accounting change. The cereal company reported earning $ 111.4 million, or 91 cents a share, during the first three months of this year, without the effects of the accounting change, compared with first-quarter earnings of $ 121.1 million, or 98 cents a share, during the same time last year. The change in how the company accounted for its income taxes boosted first-quarter 1989 earnings to $ 159.5 million, or $ 1.30 a share. Sales during the first three months of this year rose 10.1 percent to $ 1.13 billion this year compared with $ 1.03 billion last year. `` Market conditions were extremely competitive and investments in developing new products and marketing our products around the world were at record levels,'' Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> LaMothe </PERSON> said. `` We remain optimistic that our business will continue to experience strong growth, particularly in international markets.'' <PERSON> LaMothe </PERSON> also said the board of directors had authorized management to buy up to $ 100 million worth of <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> stock during the next 12 months. It was the third straight year that the board gave management authority to repurchase the stock.

 Some state securities regulators say they are ready to go easy on <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the Wall Street firm that has pledged to admit to felonies and pay millions in fines to resolve federal civil an criminal fraud charges. `` They paid their pound of flesh, there are class action suits out there. Why should I stab the dead?'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s securities director and president of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> State securities officials met here Friday to discuss punitive action against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, which faces losing its state brokerage licenses and fines for its role in the Wall Street insider trading scandals. State laws generally bar convicted or admitted felons from operating in the securities industry. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to plead guilty to six crimes and pay $ 650 million in penalties to resolve a range of fraud charges brought by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. But legal challenges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to the federal judge who must approve the criminal pact and a separate settlement with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> are delaying resolution of the federal case indefinitely. Until <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> formally enters a plea, the states are powerless to punish <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. `` The states ca n't do anything until there is an order issued of some sort,'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>'s securities administrator, who heads a panel of state regulators examining <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. But, she added, `` It probably will mean states will start negotiating a settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> even though there is no order yet.'' Anticipating a wave of punitive action, lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> have met with regulators in all 50 states. `` We're eager to come to a satisfactory resolution in this matter,'' <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> said Friday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We understand -LRB- the states' -RRB- concerns and interests.'' Regulators said they are studying punitive measures against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, including administrative fines, suspensions and supervision, and concessions that would permit the firm to continue doing business, such as selling municipal bonds, with towns and cities. State-by-state monetary settlements are another possibility. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, home to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s high-yield junk bond division that does hundreds of millions of dollars in business, has an insider-trading statute and could bar <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employees and restrain its business if it can trace back to the state part of the frauds alleged by the federal government. <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is a registered broker but has no offices, could strip the firm's license and levy fines _ $ 10,000 per violation, an amount dwarfed by the $ 650 million the firm has agreed to pay the federal government. Losing its license may not matter to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> because it is quitting the retail brokerage business, selling about half of its 43-office network to <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The rest of the department is still on the auction block. <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> said the decision was not motivated by the possibility of losing its broker-dealer license, but by declining business due to bad publicity and a weak Wall Street business environment. `` We intend to retain our broker-dealer license in every state. We do transactions with people and you just may as well be registered. It makes it much easier,'' he said. While states do n't have to prove any individual investors bought stock in companies tied to the alleged frauds, it is widely believed that citizens in all states were affected. As such, states could file civil lawsuits against the firm seeking restitution. But regulators said they plan to let class-action suits cover claims by investors who say they were defrauded by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s actions About 12 such suits have been filed, in states including <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. In taking action they also said they would consider the broad nature of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> pact, which places <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> under unprecedented supervision for three years and forces it to overhaul its management and compliance procedures. `` To the extent that they cleaned up their overall act, we have to take that into account,'' said G.W. <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION>, assistant enforcement commissioner in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's fair to say the states will rely on the investigations that have taken place to date,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> said he expects some regulators to follow the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s lead; because the commission did n't strip <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s brokerage license, they feel the states should n't either Regulators also predict that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> _ who is fighting sweeping fraud and racketeering charges _ may try to block release of internal company documents that state officials may seek to obtain, further delaying investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s activities.

 Colt Firearms, maker of the gun that won the West, was put on the auction block Friday, but the company's parent denied a three-year struggle with striking workers prompted the decision `` It's a going business and it's profitable, and, of course, it has a history of quality products,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>' parent, <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said senior officials at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> decided to sell the firearms division so they could concentrate on the company's aerospace, automotive and industrial service operations A continuing strike and the recent loss of a contract to produce M-16 rifles for the military did n't prompt the action, he added. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> declined to say whether privately held <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> had received any bids or how much the company is asking for the unit. <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has been hired to evaluate any offers. Analysts said proceeds from the sale could be used to help retire debt incurred when <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>' management mounted a $ 660 million leveraged buyout a year ago. <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a vice president with <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>, estimated Colt's outstanding debt at $ 1.8 billion. The 1,100 employees at <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>' two plants in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> were informed of the decision Friday morning. `` I think it might be a good omen,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Madore </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 376 </ORGANIZATION>. The union represented about 1,000 blue-collar workers who walked off their jobs on Jan. 24, 1986, in a dispute over wages and benefits. `` I think maybe a new face, a new owner might turn it around,'' <PERSON> Madore </PERSON> said. He said the union could make an offer to buy the company, but he cautioned that such a move has n't yet been discussed with the membership. Colt has managed to keep its plants operating by hiring replacement workers and using about 200 strikers who crossed picket lines. The dispute is now before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, where the union is seeking about $ 40 million in back wages and job reinstatement. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said a change in management could help end the walkout. `` Maybe there's an easy way out if you bring in a new company culture,'' she said. But State Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamo </PERSON>, D-West Haven, said the sale could `` very well leave those -LRB- striking -RRB- workers in the lurch. It could be devastating.'' The Colt company was founded in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> in 1836 by <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Colt </PERSON>, the inventor of the first successful repeating pistol. The pistol had a cylinder of several chambers that could be discharged in succession by the same locking and firing mechanism. It was after the entrepreneur's death in 1862 that his company manufactered the six-shooter that every cowboy carried in his holster and was said to have won the West. In addition to the M-16 rifle, the standard Army-issue rifle still used today, Colt manufactures the Colt 45 handgun, the King Cobra magnum revolver and the AR-15 rifle. Colt had produced the M-16 rifle for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> since 1964. But in October 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> announced that it was dropping Colt after it was underbid for a contract to produce about one million rifles by <ORGANIZATION> FN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> FN </ORGANIZATION> manufacturing is owned by the Belgian firm, <ORGANIZATION> Fabrique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> gained national attention in March when it voluntarily decided to halt the sale of its semi-automatic rifles in response to public outcry to the murder of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> school-children by a man using a similar assault weapon.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> shareholders adopted measures Friday to fend off unwanted takeover bids and major stock acquisitions by foreigners, the company said. Mergers and other major stock purchases would have to be approved by holders of 80 percent of the media company's common stock, not including shares owned by the prospective buyer. An exemption could be made if the company's board, acting on a recommendation from a panel of independent journalism experts, backed the transaction. An 80 percent vote also would be needed to approve any stock purchase that would result in foreign ownership of more than 20 percent of the company. Actions by shareholders at the annual meeting were n't triggered by any actual efforts to buy company stock, said <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlatter </PERSON>. `` There have been no rumors and no activity whatsoever that we're aware of,'' she said. `` This really just has to do with the business climate that we exist in, in which business takeovers are becoming a part of our way of life.'' Shareholders also agreed to reserve an additional 3.5 million shares of common stock for the company's employee stock-option plan. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> is an international communications company that publishes 30 daily newspapers and six suburban weeklies. The company has contracts to sell its eight television stations, the <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, Star-News and four smaller papers in the area.

 <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors Friday announced a realignment that establishes <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> as a holding company for its real estate and retailing operations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The restructuring of the Toronto-based corporation came as the result of a process that has been in the works since <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 6.7 billion hostile takeover last May. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON> will continue as chairman and chief executive. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tysoe </PERSON>, formerly executive vice president and president of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB-, will take over as president and chief operating officer of the newly restructured company. <PERSON> Tysoe </PERSON> replaces <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roddy </PERSON>, whose resignation was disclosed Thursday. <PERSON> Roddy </PERSON>, 45, and a veteran of the retail business, worked closely on the takeover of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>. There was no word on <PERSON> Roddy </PERSON>'s plans and an announcement Friday from <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said only that he was leaving to pursue other career interests. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> <PERSON> Luce </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president who had been involved with financial nuts and bolts of the Federated purchase, also submitted her resignation. Retail industry analysts said the changes in the corporate parent should have little direct bearing on <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s department store businesses. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> operates <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, <LOCATION> Burdines </LOCATION> and other chain stores. Also under <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate umbrella is <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> acquired in 1986 for $ 3.4 billion. Allied and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> have headquarters in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Stubing </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the changes at <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> could end up being beneficial for Allied and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>. `` I'm told that ... the people at the Allied-Federated level will have more say in day-to-day operations and strategies going forward,'' said <PERSON> Stubing </PERSON>. `` I think that's good. There's always a danger when there are decisions being made one level removed.'' She said <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s does n't intend to initiate a review of the ratings it has assigned to Allied and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> debt on account of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s restructuring. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s is a leading credit rating agency and its opinions can influence the interest rates corporations are charged to borrow money. `` I'm just waiting for the second half of the year to see how that transpires,'' she said, noting that the second six months of the calendar year is the most important time for retailers. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said the reorganization `` reflects the evolution'' that began in 1985 with `` our decision to grow beyond our Canadian real estate roots and to acquire certain prime <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail interests.'' `` We have made tremendous progress in the last year in accomplishing our strategies for asset acquisition and restructuring, as well as debt reduction and corporate financing,'' the company stated. Under the restructuring, separate subsidiaries will report to the <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> holding company. These are: <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and Allied, which together form the department store group; <ORGANIZATION> Ralphs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grocery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> supermarket unit; <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> real estate group; and <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>, the Canadian real estate development concern. Two additional executive changes were announced. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, currently senior vice president for the Eastern region of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has been named president of the restructured <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>, which comprises all of the company's commercial real estate and shopping center interests in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, executive vice president and chief financial officer of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and Allied, will expand his responsibilities and also become chief financial officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> holding company. He succeeds <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON> who resigned to return to a partnership position at a <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> accounting firm. In a separate announcement, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> reported its financial results for the year ended Jan. 31, 1989. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said its net loss came to $ 34 million in the latest period, an improvement from a loss of $ 196 million in the 13 months ended Jan. 31, 1988. Revenue from continuing operations rose to $ 8.67 billion, boosted by the acquisition of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ralphs </ORGANIZATION>, compared to $ 3.53 billion in the 13-month period a year earlier.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises Despite Intervention</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The dollar rose sharply against all major currencies except the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> dollar Friday despite central bank intervention and further indications that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy is losing steam. Gold prices took a tumble. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid price for gold of $ 377.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from Thursday's late bid of $ 382.30. A <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report showing the government's chief economic forecasting gauge slipped 0.7 percent in March failed to halt the dollar's rise both at home and abroad. The drop in the index of leading indicators, which marked the first back-to-back declines in more than a year, was interpreted as another sign the economy is cooling, and analysts predicted the slowdown will become more pronounced later this year. Dealers also noted that coordinated central bank intervention, begun by the Swiss central bank and followed by the central banks of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, failed to stem the dollar's rise. `` The dollar has been firm all day; it's just ignoring the numbers,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Even though the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> appears unlikely to tighten credit by hiking interest rates, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said investors still feel <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates are attractive. Higher interest rates make dollar-denominated securities more attractive. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, also noted that foreign investors continue to view the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy as relatively strong. `` Possibly they feel that even if we have a slowdown that leads to a recession, they're much better off with dollars because if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goes into a recession, we will really have a global recession,'' he said. Earlier in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 132.49 Japanese yen, up from 132.05 late Thursday. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar traded higher at 133.00 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar rose to 133.05 yen, from 132.12 yen on Thursday.

 Bachelors <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitassi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Klemp </PERSON> do n't have babies But they're covering the bottoms of infants with a disposable diaper they say is cheaper and better than the better-known competition. Move over Pampers, Luvs and Huggies, the diaper entrepreneurs say. Here come <ORGANIZATION> Drypers </ORGANIZATION>. The four-size, patent-pending diaper has what their company calls a `` double lock-away core'' that absorbs moisture and wicks it from the baby's skin. The core is made of paper fluff and two parallel bands of super-absorbent material that can soak up to 100 times its weight in liquid. Unlike the his-and-hers diapers that have a more absorbent material in the front and bottom, the Dryper core runs down the middle of the entire diaper, making it applicable for both girls and boys, <PERSON> Klemp </PERSON> says. `` We think our product has better features,'' says <PERSON> Pitassi </PERSON>. He and <PERSON> Klemp </PERSON> and a third partner, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tognietti </PERSON>, began marketing <ORGANIZATION> Drypers </ORGANIZATION> last summer, and they debuted on <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> grocery shelves in September. Sales are exceeding expectations, the company claims. It's reporting monthly sales of about $ 1 million and has captured 12 percent to 20 percent of the market in cities where Drypers are sold Although that's more than <PERSON> Veragon </PERSON> hoped for, it remains well below the dominance of <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of Pampers and Luvs, and <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of Huggies. So Veragon's founders are happy but reserved `` We do n't want to grow faster than we can control,'' <PERSON> Klemp </PERSON> says. Production at a new <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> plant already is running 24 hours a day, seven days a week to fill orders for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and all of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The $ 3.3 billion national diaper business is not new to the Veragon partners. <PERSON> Pitassi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Klemp </PERSON>, both 30, formed a diaper company, <ORGANIZATION> VMG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, in 1984. `` I was working for <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gamble selling diapers and saw the diaper business was growing. The country was going through a baby boom. It just represented a tremendous opportunity,'' <PERSON> Pitassi </PERSON> recalld. `` For us you had two big groups -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gamble and <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and here we had come along with the same quality, if not better, diaper for a better price,'' he says. VMG, now the third-largest diaper maker, grossed millions months after production began. Within a year, however, the two lost control of the operation in a hostile takeover. They ventured out on their own again. <PERSON> Tognietti </PERSON>, 31, learned the diaper business during nine years with <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> _ which introduced disposable diapers in 1961 with Pampers _ and helped design P & amp; G's gender-specialized Luvs diapers. Cincinnati-based <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gamble is the nation's largest producer of disposable diapers, claiming 47 percent of market. Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> is No. 2 with about 30 percent. The top two are locked in a court battle. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> is suing its main competitor for patent infringement, accusing <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> of copying the design of its highly successful super-absorbent Pampers for use in super-absorbent Huggies. <PERSON> Pitassi </PERSON> says selling <ORGANIZATION> Drypers </ORGANIZATION> close to the factory saves the company transportation costs and enables Veragon to charge an average of $ 1 less per box of diapers than the competition. Veragon picked <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> as its manufacturing center over six other <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> cities, partly because of tax abatements and ardent wooing by the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The heart of the company's 80,500-square-foot headquarters is a $ 2 million diaper-assembly machine that combines 15 raw materials. The machine, dubbed `` Drypers One'' churns out 350 diapers a minute. The company eventually may diversify and produce other paper products, but for now, <ORGANIZATION> Drypers </ORGANIZATION> is the main focus. `` No question _ our baby is <ORGANIZATION> Drypers </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Klemp </PERSON> says.

 Billionaire hotelier <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> and other suitors formally have submitted bids for strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, but the carrier remained locked Friday on its planned course of cutting operations and selling $ 1.8 billion in assets. Another potential buyer surfaced Friday, with the release of a statement purportedly from a group of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financial institutions indicating they were prepared to pay $ 1 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> _ but only if the deal included assets sold by the airline since its 1986 acquisition by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Hyatt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, informally offered around $ 500 million for Miami-based Eastern several weeks ago, according to sources close to the situation <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots union, told his membership late Thursday that <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> submitted a bid Wednesday to federal bankruptcy court, Eastern boss <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, the airline's unions and major creditors <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has requested confidential financial data on Eastern as a prelude to making an offer for the nation's seventh-largest carrier. The consortium of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financial institutions, meanwhile, said it had submitted an offer to the bankruptcy court and examiner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> that would provide more than $ 1 billion for `` acquisition and startup costs for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and additional unspecified assets.'' A brief statement issued by the consortium gave few details and a person listed as spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> did not immediately return a telephone call. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> also did not immediately return a call seeking confirmation of the proposal. The statement said the offer would give the unions a substantial equity stake in Eastern with equivalent representation on the board of directors. The consortium would provide more than $ 500 million in working capital to fund the first six months of operation under the plan, the statement said. The offer requires that no Eastern assets would be sold and assets transferred to parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> starting in early 1986 would be returned. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> has called a hearing for next Wednesday to address the question of whether <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> should be auctioned in its entirety, including the pre-1986 assets. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday his carrier still was interested in buying <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Northeast shuttle service if the planned $ 365 million sale to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> falls through <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said the Phoenix-based airline had lined up tentative outside financing and is prepared to bid $ 600 million to $ 700 million for the shuttle and a bevy of aircraft. An associate of <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> in his <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office said he was out of the country and unavailable for comment. Details of his formal bid were n't available. While confirming that the airline had received an offer from <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> insisted `` there are still no bona fide offers to buy Eastern.'' <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` is not having any discussions with any potential buyers,'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` We're moving ahead with our rebuilding plan and are making good progress in discussions with the creditors committee and the court regarding our business plan to get Eastern back in the air.'' Eastern's managers recently detailed plans to operate at one-third the airline's pre-strike size and raise $ 1.8 billion by selling assets, including planes, airport gates and landing slots at unspecified locations. As a first step, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> announced plans Thursday to lease 14 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727-200s to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> for $ 96.6 million over five years. Eastern is expected to announce more deals for leasing and selling aircraft in the coming days, according to sources close to the company. All transactions and any sale of the entire airline must be approved by federal bankruptcy court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where Eastern filed for Chapter 11 reorganization and protection from creditors on March 9. Eastern's <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union struck the carrier on March 4 after a long wage dispute and were joined by pilots and flight attendants, virtually grounding the airline and draining its cash reserves. <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>'s representatives presented an informal proposal to the creditors committee on April 14 that called for <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet of around 250 planes for an unspecified cash payment and lease them back to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, said sources close to the situation. In addition, <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> would pay Eastern around $ 100 million cash, receive all <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s stock except for an unspecified share to be owned by its unions, and would forgive $ 185 million in debt <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is owed by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, the sources said. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s agreement with ex-baseball commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> to sell Eastern for $ 464 million fell through April 12.

<HEAD>Mobil Pulls Out Of South Africa After 90 Years</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, long a proponent of doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said Friday it was leaving the racially-divided nation after 90 years of business there and will take a net loss of $ 140 million on the move. The withdrawal of <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> company doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, leaves 135 other American companies still operating there, according to the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Investor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a not-for-profit association funded by institutional investors. The oil giant said it was selling operations once valued at more than $ 400 million to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Ltd. for more than $ 155 million in cash plus $ 10 million that was expected to be the operation's 1989 profit After adjustments for taxes and accounting, the company will record a net book loss of $ 140 million on the sale. `` The rand has fallen a great deal over the last few years and that has reduced the dollar value of the company in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON>. The loss will be included in the company's second-quarter earnings report, <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> said. In a prepared statement earlier in the day, New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> had said the price exceeded <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s estimated present value of the South African operation's future earnings. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> blamed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policies, including a 1987 law that eliminated certain tax credits for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, ultimately forcing the pullout. `` The law was ill conceived ... and had a serious economic impact on us,'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. The sale, expected to be concluded by June 30, includes a refinery and retail and commercial petroleum marketing networks. Twelve <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> affiliates are involved in the sale, doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> stock closed at $ 50.75 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, down 50 cents from Thursday's close. `` This was a difficult decision because we continue to believe that our presence and our actions have contributed greatly to economic and social progress for non-whites in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. `` But we had to weigh business considerations including the impact of recently enacted and proposed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legislation and regulations which have made it more and more difficult for us to be fully competitive there.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in late 1987 passed a bill by Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, eliminating a tax credit that allowed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to deduct taxes paid to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> against taxes owed to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said that as a result of the change, earnings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> were taxed twice and the effective tax rate on South African earnings by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations was 72 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 profit was $ 2.1 billion on revenue of $ 54.9 billion. Its foreign petroleum earnings totaled $ 1.2 billion, up 5 percent from 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> had insisted since 1986 when <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil company, left <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that it would not bow to pressure to disinvest. In the last four years more than 170 American firms have withdrawn from that country because of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s race policies. Most sold their operations at what were considered low prices to South African-controlled business. Two resolutions were to be presented by church groups at <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s annual shareholders meeting in May asking the company to divest its holdings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> employed almost 2,800 people in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and had been a symbol of foreign business reluctance to leave the country, despite widespread condemnation of the white-led government's suppression of the black majority in the system known as apartheid Nevertheless, <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> has received a No. 1 rating in the last two years by a group that monitors <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies' adherence to the so-called <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Principles </PERSON>, a set of voluntary anti-discrimination guidelines for companies doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Gencor </ORGANIZATION> continues <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s equal opportunity policies and fund the <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> at $ 3 million a year at least until 1994. The foundation provides education, housing and other assistance, mostly to black South Africans. The sale leaves <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>, which does not export crude or products to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, without any holdings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, including licensing or franchise operations, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. Anti-apartheid groups cheered the move. `` <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> succumbed to anti-apartheid pressure,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Bratcher </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Interfaith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Corporate Responsiblity, an association of religious institutional investors that has targeted <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> since the 1970s. `` Whether they'll say that or not ... that's why they are selling their assets.'' <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> and other companies have maintained they are doing more good by staying in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but anti-apartheid groups claim the companies indirectly support racist policies. `` So even though they are doing good in other areas they are paying high taxes that are used to sustain apartheid,'' <PERSON> Bratcher </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices fell Friday despite economic statistics indicating that the economy is cooling and interest rates may ease. The credit market's bellwether 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issue was down -LRB- point, or $ 1.25 for every $ 1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to price, rose to 8.92 percent from 8.90 percent late Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its chief economic forecasting gauge plunged 0.7 percent in March, the second straight decline and the biggest drop in eight months. It was the first time the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, which dropped 0.3 percent in February, posted back-to-back declines since it fell for five straight months from September 1987 through January 1988. Analysts said the 30-year bond gained slightly after the economic data was announced, but the gains dwindled throughout the day. `` After the run we've had this week, I think investors were saying perhaps it's time to take a breather,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, a portfolio manager with <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` I think we will need some further signs of moderating inflation and economic growth before we get any further significant rally,'' he said. Bond traders used the opportunity to take profits following a runup in the previous session, analysts said. The 30-year bond rose -LCB- point Thursday. Analysts said the latest negative signals are in line with signs that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy is losing steam. The prospects of slower growth `` is appeasing the market for now,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Held </ORGANIZATION>, chief financial economist at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, prices of short-term securities were down from 1-16 point to 5-32 point, intermediate governments fell 3-32 point to 7-32 point and long-term maturities slumped from -LRB- point to 3-16 point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point equals a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 2.06 to 1,132.74. Corporate issues advanced. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.41 to 304.49. The Bond Buyer index was unavailable. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills leaped to 8.78 percent as the discount rose 13 basis points to 8.49 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 9.05 percent as the discount rose 9 basis points to 8.55 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 9.19 percent as the discount gained 10 basis points to 8.51 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded at 913-16 percent, unchanged from late Thursday.

 <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heileman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> officials have discussed buying a minority interest in the <ORGANIZATION> Stroh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, touching off speculation about a possible merger between two of the nation's largest beer companies. But analysts question whether such a deal could clear federal antitrust laws. <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> officials several weeks ago announced their willingness to sell a minority interest in the Detroit-based company, the third-largest brewer in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The speculation about a merger was touched off when <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutbush </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of La Crosse-based <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON>, disclosed Thursday that representatives from his company were in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> to meet with <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> officials. <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON>, which was bought by <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, is the nation's No. 5 brewer, with a 1988 estimate of 15.4 million barrels. <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Stroh </LOCATION> spokeswoman, said Friday that <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> `` is in the process of finding an international minority investment partner or partners'' for `` opportunities available to <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> outside of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' She said that <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> `` has been having ongoing meetings with a number of international brewers.'' <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> shipped an estimated 20.6 million barrels in 1988, far behind the 40.5 million shipped by the <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which is the country's second largest brewer. <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. was No 1 with a 1988 estimate of 78.5 million barrels. Industry analysts have predicted competitors of <PERSON> Anheuser </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> might need to consolidate in order to challenge the companies on a national level. `` <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON> would be a sensible merger,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, an industry analyst and professor of marketing management at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON> has a lot of volume, but not good infrastructure,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> has good infrastructure, but they do n't have a lot of volume.'' `` You're looking at creating a brewer the approximate size of <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>,'' he said. One major obstacle, however, could be antitrust laws, which blocked earlier attempts by <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON> to buy both the <PERSON> Jos </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Schlitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pabst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Schlitz </PERSON> was later bought by <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> `` If I were a smaller company, I would be squealing like a pig,'' <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> said. If such a merger were proposed, he said, a critical issue would be whether the combination of <LOCATION> Stroh </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON> would increase competition within the industry or reduce it. In his remarks Thursday to the <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wholesale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distributors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cutbush </PERSON> predicted that a third major player would emerge in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> brewing industry within five years, and he said <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON> intended to be that player. `` It's a long way between the beginning of negotiations and the completion of negotiations,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinman </PERSON>, publisher of the industry newletter, Beer Marketer's Insights. `` And a lot of negotiations never bear fruit.''

<HEAD>Precious Metals Prices Drop On Signs Of Slowing Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Precious metals prices dropped sharply Friday as evidence of a slowing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy continued to mount. The decline was led by gold, which tumbled on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to a new low for the May contract On other markets, wheat prices rose while corn and soybean prices fell; cattle prices rallied but hog prices retreated; and energy prices were mixed. Gold settled $ 5.40 to $ 6.20 lower with the contract for delivery in May at $ 377.90 a troy ounce; silver was 4.4 cents to 7 cents lower with May at $ 5.601 a troy ounce; platinum settled at $ 21.70 to $ 17.70 lower with July at $ 534.50 a troy ounce. The sell-off was largely a response to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report Friday that the index of leading economic indicators plunged 0.7 percent in March It was the second consecutive decline in the index and the sharpest in eight months. Precious metals, especially gold, are traditionally seen as safe investments during periods of rising inflation. An economic slowdown would likely result in less inflation. Platinum prices had risen sharply earlier in the week and although supply factors are bullish, `` there is a lot of uncertainty in the amount of demand,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Anagnos </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts attributed the drop in silver prices to the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s report of a relatively large amount of the metal _ 200 million ounces _ in exchange-approved warehouses The stockpile equals about 20 months of demand, <PERSON> Anagnos </PERSON> said. Wheat closed sharply higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as speculation continued on what position the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will take on whether to continue subsidized grain sales to foreign countries. Corn futures were lower, oat futures rose and soybeans fell as rains continued in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Soybeans also were pressured by word that the Brazilian dock strike was breaking up after dockworkers gave their tentative approval to a court-ordered pay raise. Corn for May delivery was boosted by rumors of a major sale to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced the sale of 1.05 million metric tons of corn to the Soviets. Wheat settled 5 -LCB- cents to 12 -LCB- cents higher, with the contract for delivery in May at $ 4.17 -LCB- cents a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with May at $ 2.69 \ a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 3 cents higher with May at $ 1.78 a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 7 cents lower with May at $ 7.22 -LCB- a bushel Cattle prices were up while hogs and pork bellies fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Cattle futures tried to go lower early in the session, but rallied late, an indication that cattle prices may have found a long-awaited bottom, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Durchholz </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Agri-Visor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, Ill. Hog prices were pushed lower by commercial selling and ideas that wholesale pork-product prices would decrease next week. Cattle settled .35 cent lower to .63 higher with June at 71.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .70 cent higher with May at 76.52 cents a pound; hogs were .03 cent to .45 cent lower with June at 46.62 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .47 cent to 1 cent lower with May at 31.37 cents a pound. Petroleum futures settled mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as traders sold before the expiration of gasoline and heating-oil contracts. Crude prices were weak in anticipation of the restart of production at the Brent oil field in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Production was cut by a platform accident last week. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 49 cents lower to 57 cents higher with June at $ 20.43 a barrel; heating oil was .10 cent lower to .50 cent higher with May at 51.70 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .13 cent to 3.91 cents lower with May at 74.21 cents a gallon.

 Petroleum futures finished mixed Friday, with gasoline falling for the second straight day after the recent steep rise in prices. The May gasoline contract declined sharply as it expired Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The contract closed 3.91 cents lower than Thursday's session at 74.21 a gallon. Other contract months lost between 1.05 and 0.13 cents. Crude oil finished mostly higher on the exchange, but the June contract fell 50 cents to end the day at $ 20.42 a barrel. The July contract remained flat at $ 19.34 a barrel. Heating oil was mixed with the May contract gaining 0.34 cent on the expiration of the contract to finish at 52.20 cents a gallon. Gasoline has been the focus of market attention recently because of expectations of tight supplies for the summer driving season, largely because of new higher octane regulations scheduled to take effect soon. But worries of even tighter supplies following the spill off the Alaskan coast last month and a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> explosion recently have sent prices zooming, at the wholesale and retail levels. Analysts have said, however, that although there might be a tightness in the gasoline market this summer, a supply shortage is unlikely.

<TEXT>
 Junk bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, who is fighting federal racketeering and fraud charges, has vowed to join another battle: raising money to revive a dying <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> shipyard. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, who was charged last month in a 98-count indictment capping an extensive government investigation, made a surprise appearance Thursday before 700 former shipyard workers at the Sons of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> hall here. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> told the group that he and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the investment firm that has agreed to dismiss him, could easily secure the millions of dollars in capital and bonds needed to finance an employee-owned shipbuilding and repair operation at Quincy's <LOCATION> Fore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> shipyard. `` By June 30, the money will be lined up for the yard,'' he said. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> said he would help with the shipbuilding venture, but his role in the venture was unclear. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> was instrumental in putting together the firm's commitment. The firm has since agreed to disassociate itself from <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> under an April 13 landmark civil fraud agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> settling charges including insider trading. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> also is barred from any business dealings with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employees. The pact, signed April 13, is pending approval by a federal judge but <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> already has placed <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> on leave of absence. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> would have no official involvement in the Quincy deal in the future. But <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> was introduced to the ex-shipyard workers as the man who would make the deal work. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> said that while <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> would manage the deal, he would make sure the project went through. It was unclear whether <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s appearance and comments would be considered a violation of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> agreement. A <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman had left the office late Friday and could not be reached for comment.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, in an attempt to capture a share of the after-hours trading of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks, is proposing a second computerized trading session, officials said Thursday. The new trading session, from 3:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. CDT, would be for the trading of portfolios and not for individual customers, said vice president <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrick </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> exchange is currently open from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. CDT. Most of the stocks traded on the exchange are also traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The exchange applied Wednesday to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for approval. <PERSON> Hendrick </PERSON> estimated that stock portfolios traded after hours equal 10 million to 20 million shares daily. But the activity is not reflected in reported trading volume and the volume is difficult to accurately measure. <PERSON> Hendrick </PERSON> said the portfolios traded in the late afternoon will be required to consist of at least 20 stocks, none of which may be greater than 10 percent of the value of the portfolio. Brokerage firms trading portfolios will send their transactions electronically into a computer at the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> exchange, which will record the trade. Currently, such trades are registered on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to comply with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> rules that member brokerages trade on recognized exchanges when it is closed. <PERSON> Hendrick </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> exchange will charge a fee to record the portfolio trades, which are recorded free of charge in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Three months after a federal appeals court ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Steelcase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> violated patents held by <ORGANIZATION> Haworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the office furniture giant has turned the tables. <ORGANIZATION> Steelcase </ORGANIZATION> filed a lawsuit Wednesday in federal court contending the smaller Holland-based company has infringed on two <ORGANIZATION> Steelcase </ORGANIZATION> patents, one granted in 1980 and the second in 1984. Both are for panel electrical wiring systems, according to the lawsuit. <ORGANIZATION> Steelcase </ORGANIZATION> insists the lawsuit is neither related to nor in retaliation for an earlier one filed by <PERSON> Haworth </PERSON> now before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. While both lawsuits involve the electrical system in the two companies' panel systems, <ORGANIZATION> Steelcase </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> said: `` They're different patents and different issues. ... It's the same church, but it's a different pew.'' <PERSON> Haworth </PERSON>, the nation's third-largest office furniture maker, sued <ORGANIZATION> Steelcase </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, claiming the industry leader was infringing on <PERSON> Haworth </PERSON> patents when it designed, made and sold certain pre-wired office panels. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Enslen </PERSON> last year ruled in favor of <ORGANIZATION> Steelcase </ORGANIZATION>, but a federal appeals court reversed that opinion in January, ruling for <PERSON> Haworth </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Steelcase </ORGANIZATION> appealed to the nation's highest court <ORGANIZATION> Steelcase </ORGANIZATION> could end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars to <PERSON> Haworth </PERSON> if the ruling stands. <PERSON> Haworth </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Planck </PERSON> said Thursday the company would have no comment until it receives formal notification of the lawsuit.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which designs and makes business computers, said Friday that earnings dropped nearly 62 percent in the first three months of 1989 due in part to efforts to acquire Prime Computer. Other factors contributing to the decline were a slowdown in the mid-range computer industry and a softened dollar overseas, the company said. Earnings for the second quarter ended March 31 declined to $ 2.4 million, or 16 cents per share, from $ 6.3 million, or 42 cents per share, for the same quarter last year. `` Although our period earnings declined compared to last year, through prudent expense controls we were able to achieve an operating income margin of 12.8 percent for the six months ended March 31, 1989, an excellent result in the context of the current industry-wide slowdown,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer. Revenue for the quarter declined from $ 105.4 million in 1988 to $ 104.7 million this year, the company said. The company said Prime Computer's resistance to a MAI tender offer made last year contributed to the earnings decline. It noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has set a May 24 hearing on company motions to invalidate Prime's takeover defense. `` MBF remains committed to acquiring Prime at the earliest possible time,'' said company Chairman <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON>. Orders for company products declined 5 percent in the first six months of the company's fiscal year, compared to the same period a year ago, primarily because of lower European sales, <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> said. MAI Basic Four designs, manufacturers and markets mid-range business computers and information processing systems for multi-user applications worldwide.
