<TEXT>
 The alarms that have been sounding for months turned to a clamor over the weekend, telling Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> that her revolution is in trouble. Strikes, inflation and interest rates _ the economic diseases Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has fought for 10 years to eradicate _ are haunting <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> again, and now comes a trouncing for her <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in European <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> elections. The government, while admitting its dismay, insists this does n't mean the end for Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s free-market crusade It says voters always use elections to the European Parliament to register protest against governments in midterm, and that the turnout of 36 percent is too low to shape lasting judgments. Nonetheless, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is jubilant, having won its first national election victory since 1974. Labor has emerged with 45 of the 78 mainland British constituencies and the <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION> 32, fully overturning the 45-32 advantage the <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION> held in the 1984 Euro-election. Labor, having revamped some of its more stridently left-wing policies to broaden its appeal, has `` been making steady progress since early this year,'' said the party's foreign policy chief, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>. `` I like the pace of it _ do n't want to go too fast, do n't want a surge that can fall again'' before before <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s next election which must be held by June 1992, he said. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> won both seats in two special elections for vacancies in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> _ in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. Conservatives called both districts `` safe'' Labor seats that the party should have won. In the <ORGANIZATION> Vauxhall </ORGANIZATION> district of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoey </PERSON> increased the party's majority In <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> halted a challenge by the Scottish <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and its candidate <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> won with a reduced but respectable majority. Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, an outspoken <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> foe in the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, believed she was in serious trouble, saying: `` If after 10 years of government you've still got nearly 2 million unemployed, you've got an overall deficit on your trade and other dealings of 15 billion pounds -LRB- $ 23 billion -RRB-, you've got interest rates up to 14 percent and you've got inflation up to 8.3 percent and rising, then people are bound to say ... is this really what we want?'' Energy Secretary <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> said: `` We recognize all those things. We agree that inflation is a great curse. We're tackling it, and one is n't popular while one is serving up the medicine.'' The inflation is widely ascribed to Thatcherism's own success in reviving the economy through tax cuts, deregulation, selling nationalized industries, abolishing foreign currency controls and curbing trade union rights. The result has been a national spending spree, a sharp increase in the trade deficit, bigger wage demands and higher interest rates. The unrest triggered by rising wage demands has raised the number of worker days lost to strikes from 38,000 in December to 82,000 in April. Wage increases are running at 9.3 percent, compared with 7.5 percent two years ago. On Wednesday, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> faces its first national rail strike since 1982. A wage-inflation spiral would be a nightmare for any government. But even more trouble awaits Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> over her plans to shake up the legal, teaching and health services, her widely unpopular property tax reform and her insistence on privatizing the national water and electricity industries. Voters may also have been put off by her combative stance toward the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, which she has portrayed as a bureaucracy bent on forcing socialism down the British throat. `` I think the general public are fed up with Euro-bashing,'' said <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>. Despite Thatcherism's difficulties, no neutral observer is ready to write her off. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has hit low patches before, her supporters say, yet she remains the only <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prime minister in more than 160 years to win three consecutive elections. Strikes may be recurring, but the number of days lost is nothing near the 30 million in the last year before she ousted Labor in 1979. Inflation has yet to approach the double-digit permanency of the years immediately before Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s ascent. Many voters seem to feel that having spent 10 years tackling <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s real problems, she is now attacking non-existent demons. On issues like health and water a widespread feeling prevails of `` if it ai n't broke, do n't fix it.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, writing in the pro-Thatcher Sunday Times, said the Euro-vote, and the surprising 15 percent share of the vote won by the environmentalist <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, reflected a yearning for a community spirit that has suffered in the hardheaded enterprise culture favored by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. Everywhere, he said, voters were distressed by what they perceive as a deregulating spirit gone too far _ from the government's refusal to impose dog licenses to combat a wave of dog attacks, to the ease with which entrepreneurs can knock down historic buildings and put up bland office blocks Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, he concluded, `` must reconstruct late-Thatcherism and must do so urgently.''

<DATELINE>OSHAKATI, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 3,000 people cheered and surged onto the road outside the <LOCATION> Ondangwa </LOCATION> refugee camp when buses carrying 170 returning exiles finally arrived. Most wore the red, blue and green colors of <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which fought for 23 years to win <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In the rush to welcome the new arrivals, few noticed a South African army truck convoy passing at that moment, its drivers grim-faced as they threaded their way toward home. The scene last week symbolizes the changes taking place in <LOCATION> Ovamboland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s populous northern tier, as the territory tries to put a 23-year bush war behind it and move toward peace and independence. The situation, say local residents and frequent visitors, has changed swiftly and dramatically since <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed in December to a plan under which it will give up <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s last colony, which it has held for 74 years. The deal also provides for U.N.-supervised elections to set up a new government. Despite a flare-up of border fighting that stalled the plan in April, the South African military presence, which once numbered 50,000 troops, has been steadily cut to about 15,000, with more leaving daily. At the main military base in <LOCATION> Oshakati </LOCATION>, once known as `` White City,'' scores of houses now stand empty, and the only South African soldiers in evidence at the base are paratroopers manning the gate. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officers occupy the former headquarters buildings. By road and rail, scores of armored vehicles used in the guerrilla war are being sent back to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Others, still caked with mud from jungle patrols, line base parking lots. Among those requisitioned by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials for use by their own forces are at least 10 Casspirs vehicles. In the hands of the hated Koevet -LRB- Crowbar -RRB- anti-insurgency police, the hulking vehicles came to symbolize the harsh South African law enforcement polices. Repainted white with big `` <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'' letters on the side, the Casspirs will be used by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> police monitors, whose job is to watch and handle complaints about the conduct of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, of which <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> is now a part. The most stunning change, say some residents and visitors, is the sudden and omnipresent visibility of <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> after years of government suppression. The nationalist movement, considered likely to win a majority in the elections scheduled for November, draws its largest support in this region of bushland, farms and scattered settlements, home to nearly half of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s 1.4 million people. Although the internal political wing of <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> could legally operate while the guerrilla unit was outlawed, this popular support remained largely hidden in the years of warfare. Even displaying the SWAPO flag often brought harassment and brutal South African treatment. Now the flag flutters openly from homes, roadside liquor stores and garages, even atop a concrete water tower near the Angolan border where, until a few weeks ago, South African soldiers manned machine guns. The exiles, said by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to number 41,000, are returning to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> aboard U.N.-chartered flights from neighboring countries to register for the November vote, the first step toward setting up an independent government. Some observers say they have been surprised by the speed of the South African withdrawal and by the lack of visible bitterness on the part of the departing forces. However, a barely concealed resentment remains among many white residents of northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> about what is taking place _ especially the demonstrations in support of <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, which many believe is determined to impose a Marxist regime if it wins the two-thirds majority needed to control the new government in the November elections. `` Are you going to write the truth about this -LRB- mess-up -RRB-?'' one German-speaking resident asked a journalist at the base guest house. Reports persist in the community that the <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION>, although officially integrated into the regular police, still holds several <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas as prisoners and continues to intimidate and brutalize <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> supporters in the countryside. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> police superintendent who commands the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> police monitoring contingent, said he had been unable to pin down `` rumors'' about prisoners.

 While Soviet citizens openly take their leaders to task and Poles vote in free elections, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Communists fire an editor who prints a short story about the human failings of an 18th century emperor <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, the communist world's third most populous nation with about 52 million people, has set definite limits on free expression and political change while moving to liberalize its economy. The list of taboos ranges from public criticism of top leaders and key policies to portraying the late revolutionary leader <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Minh </PERSON> in anything but a heroic light. In a recent interview, Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> said a multiparty system is out of the question in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and said current economic reforms will prevent pro-democracy uprisings like the one in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We advocate broadening democracy and reaching a consensus through debate, but we do not tolerate pluralism,'' party chief <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> said in a speech in March. <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> are key architects of `` doi moi,'' or renovation, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s version of Soviet glasnost and perestroika. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> moi flowered after <PERSON> Linh </PERSON>'s rise to power in late 1986, especially in southern <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, where resentment of Marxist rule is sharp and widespread. Journalists began to report on corruption and incompetence, and their exposes got some high-level officials fired. Books and magazines proliferated, some challenging the tolerance of the political system, others offering once forbidden sexual fare. But about six months ago, a backlash took shape. Either reformist leaders were trying to placate hard-liners, or the old guard simply felt things had gone too far. Western analysts say that, rather than take the broader Soviet road, the Vietnamese have opted for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s `` give the people videos but no votes'' approach. But unlike in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, advocates of democracy have been mostly confined to debate rather than street action. Many have seized upon the firing of magazine editor <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngoc </PERSON> last December as a cause celebre. The editor of the relatively radical and popular Literature and Art was pressured to quit after publishing several short stories by a controversial writer, <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Huy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiep </PERSON>. One depicted Emperor <PERSON> Quang </PERSON> <PERSON> Trung </PERSON>, a national hero who routed the Chinese two centuries ago, as a man of common foibles and frailties. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Thi </PERSON>, secretary of the Writer's <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said controversy within the 450-member organization has been `` so fierce that people forgot politeness.'' <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> An </PERSON>, a prominent literary critic, described <PERSON> Ngoc </PERSON>'s dismissal as a move by conservatives to deter doi moi `` Skeptical books about our party, socialism are not allowed. Those who tarnish national figures will be severely criticized,'' he said in an interview. Nonetheless, changes have been substantial. More than a decade ago, political prisoners abounded, teen-agers wearing jeans were suspect, and foreign journalists were escorted to meet what some Vietnamese disdainfully call `` ornamental intellectuals,'' or government mouthpieces. <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> said recently that 94,000 inmates of re-education camps had been released over the past 10 years and only 120 political prisoners remained. Relations between state and religious groups have improved. In February, the government allowed a group of prominent academics critical of education standards to open <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s first private university, <ORGANIZATION> Thang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. In the arts, one recent film, `` The Woman of the River,'' contrasts a decent ex-official of the fallen <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> government with a Communist revolutionary who turns to corruption after the war. Although an anti-war novel has yet to appear, the experiences of the Vietnam War and other conflicts are handled with more human feeling in some recent fiction. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Huu </PERSON>'s forthcoming novel, `` The Humorless Colonel,'' tells of a young officer who dies in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> because of his father's unbending military attitudes. In the past, war novels invariably depicted cardboard characters going cheerfully to their deaths for the Communist cause. While more strident voices are heard in the south, artists and intellectuls in the north do not appear intent on hurtling doi moi forward or dismantling the socialist state. `` Writers and artists must be given more freedom but liberty does n't mean destroying all gains of the past,'' <PERSON> Huu </PERSON> said. `` Writers should not be disruptive.'' Western diplomats also point out that while many students are disgruntled, an organized, pro-democracy movement among them does not appear to exist. Neither has an institution like the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> emerged around which opponents to the existing order could rally. Said one envoy in the Vietnamese capital: `` I do n't want to make any predictions, but I do n't think the Communist Party here will be challenged in the streets for several years as in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 It took a free-spending entrepreneur to deprive Solidarity of a clean sweep of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first freely elected legislative chamber. A Communist-backed businessman. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoklosa </PERSON>, who has made millions processing dead animals, edged out <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumgart </PERSON>, an activist of the independent farmers' union Rural Solidarity, in Sunday's runoff, unofficial returns showed Monday <PERSON> Stoklosa </PERSON> had drawn the Communist coalition's biggest pre-election crowd _ 50,000 people at <LOCATION> Pila </LOCATION> stadium for free sausages and beer and a drawing with prizes including a tractor, a color television and a videocassette recorder. Tickets for the drawing had been handed out free in the province's myriad small agricultural villages beforehand. <PERSON> Stoklosa </PERSON> will be a minority of one in the new 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that is to convene next month along with the more powerful lower house, or Sejm, which the ruling Communists dominate because opposition candidates were only allowed to run for one-third of its seats. A visit to <LOCATION> Pila </LOCATION> on Sunday gave some hint of <PERSON> Stoklosa </PERSON>'s assets. On the streets of the 70,000-resident western provincial town _ unusually prosperous - and tidy-looking by Polish standards _ soldiers from nearby military bases strolled arm-in-arm with girlfriends eating ice cream cones <PERSON> Stoklosa </PERSON>'s moustachioed face stared out at passers-by from election posters plastered nearly everywhere, in store windows, walls and road overpasses. There were also posters attacking <PERSON> Baumgart </PERSON> as an interloper because he comes from <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>, about 90 miles away. A journalist for Solidarity's <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> estimated <PERSON> Stoklosa </PERSON> put 200 million zlotys -LRB- $ 235,000 -RRB- into the campaign. It was believed to be the most expensive political campaign ever launched for an individual in postwar <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. In the nearby town of <LOCATION> Smilowo </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Stoklosa </PERSON>'s Farmutil company is headquartered, the polling station was doing a brisk business Sunday in an apparent show of local pride in the town's favorite son. But <PERSON> Stoklosa </PERSON> himself was absent. Attending to business first, he was at an international trade fair in <LOCATION> Poznan </LOCATION>. His Farmutil company, located on 345 acres at the end of a specially built road in <LOCATION> Smilowo </LOCATION>, gives a shiny neat appearance. But it belches an obnoxious odor over the rolling landscape, as dead farm animals and meat plant scraps are boiled down into fats and fodders for delivery by <PERSON> Stoklosa </PERSON>'s truck fleet to customers around <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. An employee, speaking as flies buzzed around, said the stench would disappear as soon as a new hermetically sealed processing system is completed. The 210-worker plant has sprung up in the past seven years. <PERSON> Stoklosa </PERSON> left his job as <PERSON> Pila </PERSON> tourism director and was kicked out of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> during Solidarity's 1980-81 heyday for alleged mismanagement. The plant now produces mainly fodder for animals, but plans are for it to expand into poultry raising, fertilizer production and slaughtering. The company makes an estimated 3 billion zlotys -LRB- $ 3.5 million -RRB- annually and published reports say <PERSON> Stoklosa </PERSON> as a result can tool around town in either one of two new Mercedes. `` He's got everything he could want in life, and now he wants other people to have more too,'' said <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Mocho </PERSON>, a Stoklosa campaign worker. `` He has very good organizing ability. He is the man who started this whole enterprise from nothing, and now people can make a good living here.'' <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Malecki </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Pila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> passed Sunday afternoon quietly at the opposition's empty campaign office with <PERSON> Leszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Woznicki </PERSON>, his former jailmate from 1982, the year thousands of Solidarity activists spent time in jail after authorities crushed their movement. They anticipated <PERSON> Stoklosa </PERSON>'s win, but treated it philosophically. `` We are aware that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> does not begin and end at <LOCATION> Pila </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Malecki </PERSON> said. No matter what the outcome, the local committee would share in Solidarity's `` great success'' because it elected one other <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate and two members to the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> from the city, he said. <PERSON> Wozniaki </PERSON>, a Solidarity activist at the town's largest industry, a light-bulb factory, said his forces were outgunned by <PERSON> Stoklosa </PERSON>'s massive poster campaign and Western-style gimmicks He blamed a lack of money, paper and printing machines and suggested Polish-Americans send more material aid to Solidarity next time. `` Tell them that a free <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> depends on them too,'' he said, only half-jokingly.

 After an 11-year hiatus, pianist <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> resumed his public performances Monday night to thunderous applause with a concert dedicated to two late friends. The audience called the pianist back to the stage 13 times after he completed his program of <PERSON> Liszt </PERSON>'s Piano Concerto No. 1 and <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>'s Piano Concerto No. 1. <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> ended the evening with four encores. `` This is a very sentimental evening for me,'' <PERSON> Clibuurn </PERSON> told the audience before the performance. `` This is an evening of remembrance of two wonderful friends.'' The pianist dedicated the concert at the open-air <ORGANIZATION> Mann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ormandy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fredric </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ormandy </PERSON>, who died in 1985, was music director of the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchestra </LOCATION> for 44 years. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador, headed the summer concert festival at the music center from 1949 until his death in 1987. <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> played with <PERSON> Ormandy </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> musicians within weeks of gaining world fame for winning the first <ORGANIZATION> Tchaikovsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competition </ORGANIZATION> in 1958. The relationship yielded numerous concerts and recordings. He also played in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> in 1978, the year he quit performed publicly, weary from a schedule that included 100 concerts a year. He said he chose the Liszt to honor <PERSON> Ormandy </PERSON>'s Hungarian background. The program concluded with <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>'s Piano Concerto No. 1. <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> spent the morning practicing with the orchestra and the afternoon shopping in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` It's so good to be back with the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchestra </LOCATION>. It seems like I never left,'' <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> said after the practice session. Among his favorite venues, <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> always listed <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s theater in <LOCATION> Fairmont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where he would often play to the audience long after the orchestra musicians had left for the night. Proceeds from Monday night's concert will help finance the orchestra's free summer series, which <PERSON> Ormandy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> began. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> of Princess <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, who traveled with <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> for six months two decades ago for a film project, said the years dropped away from the pianist in profile. `` You would never know it has been 11 years since he appeared before an audience like this,'' <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said. Since 1978, he had performed in public only twice _ in December 1987 and in January 1988 for private gatherings honoring, respectively, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the Bob Hope Cultural Center.

 `` Ghostbusters II'' zapped through a record by collecting $ 29.4 million in its first three days as the summer of'89 kept going like gangbusters at the nation's box offices. The <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>' film's $ 8.3 million on Sunday was the biggest non-holiday Sunday ever, according to <ORGANIZATION> Exhibitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which tallies box-offce receipts. `` We are thrilled with the opening weekend's record breaking results and we anticipate that ` Ghostbusters II' will play very strongly in the coming weeks,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s new chief, <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>. The previous three-day record was set earlier this month by `` Indiana <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and the Last Crusade,'' which earned $ 21.2 million in its second week. It also easily topped <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s previous three-day record of $ 13.6 million for `` Ghostbusters'' in June 1984. Since the debut of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Aykroyd </PERSON>'s paranormal investigators, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> has been spooked by several cinematic clunkers, most recently `` True Believer,'' `` The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'' and `` Physical Evidence.'' The company's only hit in recent years was 1987's `` La Bamba.'' The true test for ` Ghostbusters II'' comes Friday, when it will compete with the much-hyped `` Batman.'' <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>'s `` Indiana <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and the Last Crusade'' kept up its charge, selling $ 11.7 million in tickets last weekend to claim second place on the box-office charts. In just four weeks, it has grossed more than $ 122 million. `` Dead Poets Society,'' the bittersweet prep school drama, earned $ 9.1 million to pass `` Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' and move into third place. `` Star Trek V,'' the first film directed by star <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatner </PERSON>, slipped badly from first to fourth place on sales of $ 7.1 million. In fifth was `` See No Evil, Hear No Evil,'' with <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, with $ 2.5 million. The baseball movie `` Field of Dreams,'' starring <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Costner </PERSON>, finished in sixth with $ 2.4 million. In seventh was the wrestling film `` No Holds Barred,'' with $ 1.7 million. Rounding out the top 10 were `` <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' with $ 1.5 million, `` Pet Sematary'' with $ 1.2 million and `` K-9'' with $ 1 million. Since Memorial Day weekend, weekend box office revenues have grossed $ 247.3 million, compared with $ 220 million for the period last year, an increase of 11 percent, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Krier </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Exhibitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which tallies the box-office receipts. `` The gross is n't distributed quite the same,'' he said. `` Last year there were more pictures playing and the gross was more evenly distributed. This year the grosses are concentrated in the top two or three movies.'' Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in release. 1. `` Ghostbusters II,'' <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, $ 29.4 million, 2,327 screens, $ 12,229 per screen, $ 29.4 million, one week. 2. `` Indiana <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and the Last Crusade,'' Paramount, $ 11.7 million, 2,327 screens, $ 5,039 per screen, $ 122.3 million, four weeks. 3. `` Dead Poets Society,'' <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, $ 9.1 million, 1,091 screens, $ 8,343 per screen, $ 22.4 million, three weeks. 4. `` Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,'' Paramount, $ 7.1 million, 2,202 screens, $ 3,247 per screen, $ 31.2 million, two weeks. 5. `` See No Evil, Hear No Evil,'' Tri-Star, $ 2.5 million, 1686 screens, $ 1512 per screen, $ 38 million, six weeks. 6. `` Field of Dreams,'' Universal, $ 2.4 million, 1,077 screens, $ 2,265 per screen, $ 44.2 million, nine weeks. 7. `` No Holds Barred,'' New Line, $ 1.6 million, 1,327 screens, $ 1,339 per screen, $ 12 million, three weeks. 8. `` Road House,'' <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.5 million, 1,435 screens, $ 1,069 per screen, $ 23.8 million, five weeks. 9. `` Pet Sematary,'' Paramount, $ 1.2 million, 923 screens, $ 1,365 per screen, $ 52.7 million, nine weeks. 10. `` K-9,'' Universal, $ 1 million, 970 screens, $ 1,055 per screen, $ 36.7 million, eight weeks.

 After years of absence, mountain goats will be returned to the steep slopes of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> with the help of tranquilizers, helicopters and thousands of dollars in donations. Volunteers plan to relocate at least 10 wild goats from a remote site south of <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> or the Olympic Peninsula of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in late summer or early fall. The goal is to restore a herd of goats that can be viewed by residents and tourists in downtown <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>, which sits in the narrow valley between <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roberts </LOCATION>. `` If all goes well, in a year or two or five we'll have a population that will create splinter groups to proliferate in valleys from <LOCATION> Taku </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Berners </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>,'' said project coordinator <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a member of the state Fish and Game Board. `` <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> used to be goat habitat,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said Monday. `` Goats were there quite commonly back in the mining days, the early days of <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>.'' However, overhunting led to the goats' disappearance near the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> city. Although goat hunting has been banned in the area for several years, the goats have never returned. Since the <ORGANIZATION> Juneau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> began soliciting money for the project in February, it has collected about $ 9,500 in money and services _ enough to start the project, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> hopes to have $ 12,000 by the time the relocation begins, and said he has been encouraged by the public response. Donations have included helicopter time from a local charter outfit, a $ 1,000 check and $ 30 worth of quarters that a little girl collected in a bag. If the goats can not be captured south of <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Whiting </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the volunteers will turn to the <LOCATION> Olympic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> where the goat population has become a nuisance. `` We actally gave the goats to the Olympic Peninsula in the first place. We would be getting the same stock back,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. State wildlife officials will tranquilize the goats, which will be transported to the mountain by helicopters. Officials hope to get at least three males and seven females to ensure that the population grows. Radio collars will be put on some of the goats so their movement can be monitored.

 In the belief that these are vinegar's salad days, a bus driver has brought out a book entirely on the centuries-old food seasoning. `` Vinegar is something more than just to put in your salad,'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Diggs </PERSON> said at a news conference Monday flanked by various vinegars. One displayed was the gourmet's balsamic, which can cost up to $ 30 for a few ounces. <PERSON> Diggs </PERSON> believes his 259-page book `` Vinegar'' is the most complete ever written on the subject. Vinegar, from the French word for `` sour wine,'' is the end product of fermentation. Anything that can be fermented into alcohol _ including fruits, grains, orange juice, molasses, honey _ can be made into vinegar. The tome covers vinegar's history, commercial production, how to make it at home, and medicinal uses. `` To remove a freckle, apply vinegar,'' the author prescribes. Soda mixed with vinegar will deal with heartburn, while hay fever can be combated by inhaling horseradish and vinegar several times a day. <PERSON> Diggs </PERSON> even has a chapter on vinegar trivia. `` If one dreams about vinegar, it signifies jealousy or a quarrel,'' he advises, and `` Never give vinegar away or your luck will go with it.'' The author, a Zen Buddhist, said he planned to use profits from the $ 24.95 book to establish a monastic hermitage. He also expressed gratitude to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Municipal Railway for helping make his book possible. `` I wrote a lot of the book on the bus,'' he confided.

 The nation's private employers now have expanded authority to require drug tests of job applicants, while railroads and airlines have greater power to test those already on the job. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> says private employers may decide unilaterally to require drug testing of job applicants, although they still must negotiate with unions if they want to test their employees, The board's decision came Monday, the same day the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in a more narrowly defined case that railroads may require tests for workers without first bargaining with unions. The decisions regarding existing workers appeared at odds, but they involved two separate labor laws, the Railway Labor Act that applies only to rail and airline workers, and the National Labor Relations Act which governs other labor contracts. The court case, a victory for <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>, followed earlier rulings in which railroads and airlines won the right to test workers for drug and alcohol use, principally on grounds of concern for public safety. The <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> case covers far more industries. One attorney involved with the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> decision said he expected it to lead to a proliferation of job applicant testing requirements. `` People who had been taking a sit-back-and-wait approach may now go ahead'' with pre-employment screening, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennison </PERSON>, vice president for labor relations for the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> newspaper of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` There's been a lot of interest. We've had a lot of inquiries.'' Labor Department figures show that about 11.05 million union members worked in the private sector last year, along with 1.1 million workers who are not members of unions but whose jobs are covered by union contracts. A department study released in January said that just 3 percent of the nation's private-sector employers had drug-testing programs, although 43 percent of businesses with 1,000 or more workers had testing programs. The Newspaper Guild had challenged the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>'s policy of testing job applicants for drug and alcohol use without first seeking to negotiate such a policy with the union. An administrative law judge sided with the Guild in 1987, but the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> overturned the part of the judge's decision relating to pre-employment testing. Since applicants for union-represented jobs at the newspaper were not yet members of the union, `` We find that drug and alcohol testing of applicants for employment is not a mandatory subject of bargaining,'' the board said. It did, however, uphold a portion of the judge's decision requiring the newspaper to provide the union with the names and addresses of applicants who were offered jobs but did not take them, including those who refused to submit to testing. The board said the Guild was entitled to the information to monitor <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> hiring practices for any signs of discrimination. The union, as part of its challenge of the policy, said male applicants were allowed to provide urine samples without being observed, while female applicants were required to give the samples partially unclothed and in the presence of a nurse. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> case involved <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>'s 1987 decision to check for drugs as part of a urinalysis administered to workers periodically and when they return to work after absences. The tests were adopted in 1976 but prior to 1987 were used only to check for health problems such as diabetes. Railway unions said adding the drug test was a `` major'' labor-management dispute under the federal Railway Labor Act, and therefore was a bargaining issue. Minor disputes may be settled by the railroad without negotiations with the union, although any decision is subject to arbitration. `` <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>'s well-established recognition of the relevance of drug use to medical fitness substantially weakens the union's claim that <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> now, for the first time, is engaging in medical testing that reveals facts about employees' private off-duty conduct,'' Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said in writing for the court. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a lawyer who represented the railroad unions, said he hopes <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will act to protect workers' rights by assuring drug tests are reliable and accurate. In another drug-testing case, the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> ruled Monday that a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> company violated labor law when it decided in 1986 to require all employees who were injured on the job and required treatment to submit to tests. The <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bateman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a manufacturer of concrete pipes, contended that a `` management rights'' clause in its contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union allowed it to implement the policy. But the board, siding with the union, said there was no evidence that drug testing was among the issues covered by the clause, which allowed the company to make certain work rule changes. `` The instant drug-alcohol testing requirement is a mandatory subject of bargaining,'' the board said. Company officials were not available for comment Monday, according to a receptionist in their office, and the company's lawyer also was not at his office Monday afternoon

<HEAD>Congress Should Protect Workers' Rights in Drug-Testing, Lawyer Says</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should step in to protect the privacy rights of workers who face drug testing as the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> expands some employers' authority to require such tests, a union lawyer says. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, an attorney who represented railway workers in a case the high court decided Monday, said he hopes <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will help workers by assuring drug tests are reliable and accurate. `` That's really what labor is concerned about,'' he said. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said in the long run federal legislation could be more significant than Monday's ruling in determining how drug tests will be conducted. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Savelson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> lawyer whose firm represents airlines, said the ruling is unlikely to have much impact beyond the railroad and airline industries. `` Collective bargaining will still be required'' before most employers can adopt drug tests, he said. The justices, in their first decision focusing on drug testing in private employment, ruled, 7-2, that railroads that already require physical examinations for workers may require drug tests as well without bargaining with unions over the issue. The court said <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ acted legally when it unilaterally decided to use urinalysis tests to check for drugs. The court based its ruling on an interpretation of the federal Railway Labor Act. That law applies to airlines as well, but the ruling may have limited impact for other industries covered by separate federal legislation. The justices, in two key decisions last March, said workers in sensitive government jobs or entrusted with public safety in federally regulated work may be forced to undergo the tests. <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> decided in 1987 to check for drugs as part of a urinalysis administered to workers periodically and when they return to work after absences. The tests were adopted originally when <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> was formed in 1976. But their primary purpose before 1987 was to check for physical fitness, not the presence of drugs. For example, the tests would reveal whether an employee had diabetes or other health problems. Railway labor unions said adding the drug-screening component is a `` major'' labor-management dispute under the Railway Labor Act, and therefore must be submitted to union-management negotiations. Minor disputes can be settled unilaterally by the railroad, although any such decision by an employer is subject to arbitration. Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, writing for the court, said the drug-screening change is minor because `` the action is arguably justified by the terms of the parties' collective bargaining agreement.'' Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> dissented. Monday's decision overturned a ruling by the Philadelphia-based 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> that barred <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> from conducting the tests without evidence that particular workers engaged in drug abuse. The railroads said the need for drug testing is underscored by an accident at <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, on Jan. 4 1987, in which an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> passenger train collided with <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> locomotives, killing 16 and injuring 174. The <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> engineer and brakeman later were found to have been using marijuana. The railroads also cited studies that estimated 25 percent of railroad workers drink alcohol on duty. The studies said between 1975 and 1985, alcohol and other drugs were responsible for 37 deaths, 80 injuries and $ 34 million in property damage. In other action, the court: _ Refused to reinstate former <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandel </PERSON>'s 1977 mail-fraud conviction, thrown out five years after he completed a prison term. _ Refused to kill a nine-year-old lawsuit in which the <ORGANIZATION> Catawba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribe </ORGANIZATION> claims ownership of 225 square miles of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> _ Rejected an appeal by a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> woman facing criminal charges in an attempted faith-healing of her four-year-old daughter who died of meningitis _ Struck down, by a 6-3 vote, a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> law aimed at assuring that beer sold in the state costs no more than it does in three neighboring states _ Refused to hear an appeal by <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, a professor and writer threatened with deportation from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for supporting communism

 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> says a cruise-missile engine agreement with a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> company will be canceled even though the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> found the deal led to lower prices. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will cancel the agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walled </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, on grounds that it should not have committed the service to future contracts, <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> wrote last week to Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich. `` For each of the past 10 years, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has submitted competitive prices well below those of its competitor for production engines,'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> wrote `` We do believe that the fact of competition has benefited the taxpayer by creating an added incentive to lower prices.'' He said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has exceeded its reliability goals and delivered every engine ahead of the contract date. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> in 1978 signed an agreement that would allow a competitor, <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to use <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' technology to build cruise-missile engines for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. In return, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> guaranteed it would buy 240 engines a year from <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>, plus 25 percent of any additional purchases up to 1,200 engines annually. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, in an April letter to <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, had written that the decade-old agreement with <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was `` severely limiting our contracting options and decisions, in a manner which we believe inconsistent with sound procurement policy and the public interest.'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> also said in April that <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION>'s prices had become `` very competitive'' with <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> beginning last year. The April letter was made public by a whistle-blower group called the Project on Military Procurement. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> released last week's letter <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s cancellation of the 1978 agreement `` in no way implies criticism of <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s integrity or performance.'' `` We appreciate the emphasis on ethics that has always been part of <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s management, and we consider it an outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contractor,'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> wrote. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said Monday he could not immediately comment on the two letters. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said that even though the agreement was still being canceled, `` There are some real differences'' between <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>'s April letter and what he wrote last week `` Maybe he recognizes that his first letter was really not the most accurate reflection of the situation.''

 The odds were heavily against <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> when he sought the White House. Now he's on another track, and the odds are on his side. One day, the new leader of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic majority can almost certainly become the 50th speaker of the House. As his party's floor leader, he is in the job that has produced the last 12 speakers. Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s promotion from majority leader to speaker two weeks ago opened the leadership spot for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> to win. It's not the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but it's not bad work. And of course, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s options are open. He's ruled out a presidential bid in 1992. But at 48 he's got plenty of time to change political goals again. With a 258-175 majority over the Republicans _ in an era when incumbents seldom lose _ the Democrats are likely to be electing speakers for quite a while. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, who begins his speakership at 60, give the Democrats a new-look team that blends the get-along skill of the legislative insider with the political savvy of the national campaigner. And <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was known as an able congressional politician before he tried to go national. Third man in the leadership is the new Democratic whip, Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, the first black to win a top leadership post, proved able and adept as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> where he held what had been a wavering Democratic line against the lure of Reaganomics. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> turned aside questions about his future presidential ambitions by saying the voters made that call for him in 1988. But he clearly had been planning another bid for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1992 until the swift and unforeseeable shakeup that opened his path to the leadership. That came when Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the Democratic whip, announced that he was resigning rather thn undergo an ethics investigation into a 1986 junk bonds deal. He was in line to succeed <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> as majority leader with the resignation of Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, his 47th birthday. A few weeks earlier, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had mused aloud about the personal and financial demands of another bid for the presidential nomination, saying he had not decided whether to take them on in advance of 1992. He said he knew that would require him to get started soon and he did n't like that idea. The question, he said then, was whether he could effectively pursue his policy goals in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Now, as majority leader, he intends to. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said after winning the leader's job that he agreed with Speaker <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> on the priority agenda, including ethics and campaign reform. Then he turned to the economic issues that were the themes of his 1988 campaign. `` In my humble opinion, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is beginning to be in a state of decline,'' said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who pressed issues of trade and productivity during his presidential run. `` And we as Democrats have to lead ... Even though the presidency is held by a different party, and even though getting our consensus together on the Democratic side is always difficult to do.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> entered the Democratic presidential field as an early advocate of tax reform and a champion of protectionist trade legislation. `` It's your fight, too,'' was his message to the voters. The seasoning he gained and the scrutiny he faced as a presidential candidate will serve <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> well in his new role. Like Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who ran twice for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, he knows the techniques of national politics better than colleagues who have done all their campaigning in home districts or congressional cloakrooms. Both he and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> won the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, the leadoff events of the 1988 campaign, then foundered and were finished by the March 8 Super Tuesday primaries. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> quit in time to file for reelection to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> from his <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> district, saying he'd done his best, made his mistakes and had no complaints or alibis. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> faced sharp challenges in 1988 campaign debates for changing his positions over the years on such issues as a constitutional amendment to ban abortion, on school busing, on Reaganomics. He said change was evidence of growth, of seeking better ways to do things. That explanation plays better in the congressional world of compromise and consensus than in the presidential campaign arena. Now he's tried both, and says he is not going to use the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership as a stepping stone to anything else. `` You ca n't be an effective majority leader and be running for president,'' he said. As for the odds: The last sitting <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member to vault directly to the White House was Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON>, in 1880. Not since 1919 has the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority elected a speaker who did not serve first as his party's floor leader.

<HEAD>Worst Wind Erosion in 30 Years Sweeps Over Great Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wind erosion over the winter inflicted its worst damage in three decades on the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, ripping away topsoil over 14.3 million acres, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. `` The big reason for the increase is the drought,'' soil conservation service chief Wilson Scaling said Monday. `` Not only was it dry but it meant we went into the wind erosion season with inadequate vegetative cover and little residue to protect the soil from blowing.'' He said the last time the May-November wind erosion season wrought so much damage on the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> was when 15 million acres were damaged in 1954-55, when the department first began to keep such records. In the worst day of the season, winds of up to 80 miles an hour swooped through on <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> on March 14, damaging 4.8 million acres. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> was the hardest hit state, with more than 5 million acres damaged. It was a record for the state. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> was second with 2.3 million acres harmed and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> followed with almost 2 million acres damaged. More than 90 percent of the damage is on lands being used for crops. The rest is on rangeland. Wind erosion damage last year uprooted soil from some 12 million acres. The department said farmers used emergency tillage on 3 million acres, a system under which topsoil with sufficient moiture is roughened to prevent blowing. More than half of the emergency tillage was in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Here is a list of the amount of acres damaged in each <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> state: <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> 1,832,000; <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> 191,600; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> 2,297,700; <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> 678,600; <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> 552,700; <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> 1,403,700; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> 5,126,300; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> 118,000; <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> 111,900; <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> 1,979,600.

 Wheat production in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> should fall slightly below previous estimates for the next year, suggesting supplies already reduced by last year's drought will remain tight, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> says. With world stocks already at their lowest in more than a decade, prices could be somewhat skittish in the crop year that began June 1, responding sharply to changes in growing conditions and import demand, the department said. A drop of $ 10 a ton in the price of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat in recent weeks represents an example of this sensitivity, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in its monthly World Grain Situation and Outlook report. Despite such fluctuations, however, prices should remain strong on the whole, the department said. It said the overall strength in prices combined with an improvement in crop prospects in some of the traditional importing countries is expected to reduce world demand from the level of a year earlier. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said the major change will come in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where wheat imports are expected to decline by around 20 percent to 12 million tons. Estimated exports by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> remain the same as previously, but the forecast of production has been lowered to reflect a smaller than expected crop of durum, the wheat used for pasta. The report said that might mean increased <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> imports of North American durum and might even trigger a cutback in Italian semolina exports to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The European Community estimate was for 77.8 million metric tons, down from 78.5 million last month. The estimate of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production was 55.2 million, down from 55.8 million in last month's report.

 Parrot lovers and other buyers of exotic birds are getting a stern warning from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> to make certain their pets meet federal import requirements. The warning has been brought on by an outbreak of exotic <ORGANIZATION> Newcastle </ORGANIZATION> disease among 17 <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> parrots, sun cockatoos and other birds owned by a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> collector. Seven of the parrots were purchased from a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> dealer on May 19 and became ill. They and 12 other birds were dead by June 14. Meanwhile, the collector had sold some of the birds to five pet stores and a number of individual purchasers. The birds were tested by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ames </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, operated by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. They were found to have exotic Newcastle disease. To prevent further spread of the disease, the collector's 60 remaining birds were destroyed, the department said. It said it will pay the collector more than $ 45,000 in indemnities for the destruction of his collection. Exotic Newcastle disease is a virus that is deadly to all birds and could be a major problem for the commercial poultry industry, although no commercial flocks have been infected yet. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON>, acting director of the inspection service, said smuggled birds enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by the hundreds following the winter breeding season and often carry exotic Newcastle disease without showing symptoms. He said exotic birds imported into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must be declared to federal inspectors, carry appropriate permits and enter a mimimum 30-day quarantine. The Agriculture Department tests them for disease during that time.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, drawing a lesson for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s youth from the struggles of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s students in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, is urging young people to devote their lives to democratic ideals and community service <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was honoring 121 of the nation's top high school seniors, the 1989 Presidential Scholars, at the White House today, after making a quick journey by helicopter Monday evening to deliver a commencement address at <ORGANIZATION> Cheltenham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wyncote </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. There, in a steamy gymnasium packed with 2,500 people, he delivered a message intended for all 2.5 million seniors graduating from high school this June, not just Cheltenham's 331. `` We do not have to stand in front of tanks in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, thank God. But we do have to summon the same courage to confront the evil that exists in the world,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He told the <LOCATION> Cheltenham </LOCATION> graduates they were the heirs to a legacy of American sacrifice, from <LOCATION> Bunker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bastogne </LOCATION>, `` where we upheld the tenets of democracy,'' and from the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. `` Today I ask you to take a risk for a cause larger than ourselves,'' he said. `` It is the cause of helping others and thereby <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It is the cause of democratic ideals.'' He said brave people are struggling in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for basic human rights and freedoms that `` our ancesors secured for us _ and that we too often take for granted.'' Recalling the solitary young man who briefly stopped a column of tanks in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on June 5, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` That vivid, unforgettable image illustrates how precious is the freedom that is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s secret weapon and her shield. He called volunteerism and community service `` central to our fabric as a nation, and as a people. No, they are n't as dramatic as the profiles in courage of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, the gulags and Tiananmen Square. `` But they reflect the same sense of sacrifice and of concern ... for country, decency, our fellow man,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to keep the spotlight on youth and altruism on Wednesday at the White House when he announces details of the `` YES to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> Initiative.'' The acronym stands for Youth Entering Service. `` We will refute those who speak of a ` me' generation. Instead this program can build a cathedral of the spirit, and help yours become a global ` we' generation,'' he told the seniors. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has previously announced plans to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to invest $ 100 million over four years into a YES Foundation to encourage young people to perform community service. He will head the foundation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was introduced at <LOCATION> Cheltenham </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Hang </PERSON> <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON>, a senior graduating with top honors who came to this country as a refugee from her native <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1975. Her mother still lives there. `` Each of us has come to this moment in a different way,'' she said. `` Our commencement is both a common achievement and a unique one. In some ways these ceremonies are like thousands of others being held across the nation.'' But, she added, they were also `` unique because of this class ... this school ... this community'' _ and the commencement speaker. The 330 <ORGANIZATION> Cheltenham </ORGANIZATION> seniors had to yield some graduation tickets and curtail their own speeches to make room for the president and his entourage. `` Half of us were excited,'' said <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>. `` But there were those who thought it is more important for more of the relatives to come than the president.'' But another senior, <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherry </PERSON>, said, `` It's the greatest thing that could happen to a senior class.'' Each graduate got a handshake from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and many of the girls stole a kiss as well. The graduates wore blue and gold robes, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in academic garb himself. <PERSON> Cheltenham </PERSON>'s alumni include baseball star <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, an architect of the Social Security system, and Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a Nobel Prize winner for medicine.

<HEAD>Study Finds Black Men Have Faster Heart Rates Than White Men Under
Exercise</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Black men experience a faster heartbeat at moderate exercise than do their white counterparts, a finding that may account for the greater incidence of high blood pressure and heart disease among blacks, according to a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> researcher. Dr. <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ekelund </PERSON>, an associate professor of medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, said an analysis of treadmill stress tests conducted as part of a national study showed black men tended to have about eight more heartbeats a minute than white men at the same levels of exercise. `` We found a difference that was highly significant,'' said <PERSON> Ekelund </PERSON> in an interview Monday. `` If you take those eight beats, it corresponds to about a 30 percent increase in risk for coronary heart disease.'' The increased heartbeat rate during exercise could also explain why blacks tend to have more hypertension, or high blood pressure, and more strokes than whites, he said. Resting pulse rates, taken before the exercise, showed no significant difference between the races. <PERSON> Ekelund </PERSON> said a weakness in the study is that only 83 black men participated while 2,548 white men were counted. A much larger study is needed, he said, to confirm the data. <PERSON> Ekelund </PERSON> said the pulse rates probably are a fundamental genetic difference between the races in their response to exercise. This difference, he said, may be important when evaluating the cardiac health of a black male. Higher heartbeat rates usually suggest a person is less fit, but for a black male the higher rate may be normal. `` It suggests we should apply different norms for black males compared to whites,'' said <PERSON> Ekelund </PERSON>. If the same norms are used for a black person as for a white person, he said, the difference in heartbeat rate would make a black man appear less fit than he actually is. The study is based on data collected from men between the 20 and 69. None of the test subjects had detectable heart disease when the tests were administered. The data was adjusted, said <PERSON> Ekelund </PERSON>, for differences in age, weight and other factors which can affect individual heart rates. <PERSON> Ekelund </PERSON> said the research agrees with an earlier study that monitored the blood pressure of boys while they played stressful video games. That study showed black youths tended to have higher blood pressure in response to the excitement of the game. `` This suggests that blacks may inherit an increased response to stress which may explain their higher prevalence of hypertension,'' he said. The data used in the study was collected by the National Heart, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> as part of a national research effort by 10 clinics. A massive amount of data was collected in the 1970s and is still being analyzed. <PERSON> Ekelund </PERSON> presented the research finding Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Preventive Cardiology.

<HEAD>Heart Disease Death Rates Declining In West, Up in Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Heart disease death rates have been retreating for almost three decades in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> industrialized countries and experts at an international conference say they still do n't know why. `` There is one less coronary -LRB- heart attack -RRB- every minute in this country,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenfant </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION>, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have witnessed a significant decrease in heart disease. But the cause of this decline is not clear.'' <PERSON> Lenfant </PERSON> said the decline in heart attacks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> started in the 1960s, when the rate of death from cardiac disease was more than 400 per 100,000 persons. The rate is dropping at a steady annual rate and now is about 330 per 100,000 persons. `` It keeps going down and there is no sign of its leveling off,'' <PERSON> Lenfant </PERSON> told reporters Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> 2nd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Preventive Cardiology. He said the reasons could be a reduction in smoking, better diets, more exercise or better treatment. But it would take a large, comprehensive study to pinpoint the exact reason for the change. `` The decline in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -LRB- of heart disease deaths -RRB- is extraordinary,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedewald </PERSON>, associate director for disease prevention at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. `` But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> still has one of the highest rates in the world.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which already has one of the lowest rates of cardiac disease in the world, is also experiencing a decline in death rates. Dr. <PERSON> Hirotsugu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueshima </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardiovascular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said that in 1970 there were 120 cardiac disease deaths annually per 100,000 persons over age 60 in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. That rate now has dropped to 100. For those age 50 to 59, the rate has dropped from 60 per 100,000 in 1970 to 40 at present. `` It is still going down,'' said <PERSON> Ueshima </PERSON>. People in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, he said, are now eating more animal fat, thought to be a risk factor in heart disease, but this has had no apparent impact on rate of heart disease. `` Even though there is more meat -LRB- a source of animal fat -RRB- in the diet, it is still lower than the American diet,'' he said. Japanese get about 25 percent of their calories from fat, compared to about 38 percent in the American diet, he said. Healthier hearts, however, are not universal. A <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> study released at the conference shows deaths among men from heart disease rose steeply between 1970 and 1985 in nearly all of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries where data is available. The study included only industrialized countries and did not include trend data from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> led the rate of reported increase with heart disease death rates shooting up by 62 percent. By comparison, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during that same period, the rates declined by 36.5 percent. Even with the increase, however, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> still has a lower rate of heart disease mortality for men, about 297 per 100,000 persons, than the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, the report says. The male heart disease death rate in other countries included increases of 30 percent in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>; 36.9 percent in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>; 42.8 percent in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>; 19.5 percent in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>; 18.1 percent in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, and 14.4 percent in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Deaths among men from heart disease declined throughout western and northern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and also in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. An exception was <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, where the rate increased by 0.8 percent. Except for <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, heart disease death rates declined for women in all of the reported countries. The rates for women declined most remarkably in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, both with drops of about 50 percent. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the death rates for women dropped by 33.8 percent and stood at 119 per 100,000. According to the report, the lowest rate of death due to heart disease was among women in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where the rate was 41 per 100,000. The highest was among men in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> where the rate was 438 per 100,000.

 Information on what hazardous chemicals are being released from nearby industrial plants will soon be as close as the home computer or a neighborhood library, says the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> unveiled its computerized database for toxic chemical releases on Monday and said that in the coming months the information _ which will be updated yearly _ will be available in microfiche as well as computer disc and magnetic tape. The inventory of releases, which is based on information provided the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> by each company, also may be obtained through ToxNet, a computer information system of the National Library of Medicine. Access to ToxNet will cost $ 25 an hour and be accessible by home computers 24 hours a day. A 1986 law, which took effect last year, requires industry to supply information each year on what toxic chemicals are being released from plants. The requirement covers 328 hazardous chemicals. It took the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> nearly a year to develop the computer database, but <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Elkins </PERSON>, director of toxics at the agency, said the job is likely to be easier and quicker next time around. Industry is scheduled to submit its second round of data at the end of this month, covering releases in 1988. The first set of data was submitted nearly a year ago, reflecting releases in 1987. `` We have tried to make the computerized inventory as ` user friendly' as possible,'' said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> database allows a person to focus on a single industrial plant and learn what toxic releases into the air, water, or soil the plant has reported to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> during the latest reporting year. The system includes a variety of indexes including type of chemicals, names of plants, and locations of plants down to counties, cities and postal zip codes, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said the computerized database or microfiche will be made available to more than 1,400 federal libraries and local public libary systems so that at least one library in every county will have the data available. In addition, the database on computer disc or magnetic tape will be for sale through the Government Printing Office or the National Technical Information System -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NTIS </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Will Merge Strike Forces Into U.S. Attorneys' Offices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> says his decision to merge the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s organized crime strike forces into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys' offices will eliminate confusion and duplication in the current system. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said Monday the 14 strike forces will be abolished and organized crime units will be created in 23 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys' offices around the country by Oct. 1. The plan, which the attorney general earlier said he was considering, has drawn fire from some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who contend it would blunt an effective weapon against organized crime. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, said in a statement the changes `` are designed to ensure that the department's resources are more comprehensively directed against organized crime. `` They will help reduce confusion and overlapping jurisdiction among federal investigators and prosecutors as well as making more resources available by shutting down duplicate offices,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. Congressional hearings are planned on the issue, including one scheduled today by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary criminal justice subcommittee. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, called <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s announcement on the eve of the subcommittee's hearing `` sort of a slap in the face to the many senators and representatives who asked him to wait until we could really discuss this.'' <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said the subcommittee he chairs has taken no position on the issue but has heard good arguments both for keeping and for abolishing the strike forces. If lawmakers determine <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> made a wrong decision `` we will consider introducing legislation to preserve the strike forces,'' he said. The strike forces were conceived in the 1960s by then-Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Since 1984, members of the top echelon of organized crime families in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, were convicted as a result of strike force prosecutions. The debate over the strike forces is not new. But it flared up earlier this year when <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> disclosed he was considered a plan to abolish them. Several senators, including <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mass </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., urged <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> not to abolish the strike forces In an article published in Monday's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> argued that `` there is no justification for such a step.'' They suggested that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was responding to the traditional hostility to strike forces by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys who are protective of their turf. `` Ending all strike forces to assuage <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys' egos would be a triumph of ideology over common sense and could destroy the federal organized-crime program,'' the senators wrote. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, a former Abscam prosecutor, said it would be `` a mistake to abolish them.'' `` You wo n't have a group that's permanently dedicated to organized crime,'' said <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> defense lawyer. `` You also develop a certain amount of professionalism and although there are some outstanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys, those selections are still made politically to some degree,'' he said. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he would create an organized crime council within the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to coordinate the fight against such criminal activity.

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will on Wednesday turn over the remains of what it believes are 28 American servicemen missing from the Vietnam War, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spokesman said. Maj. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Trout </PERSON> said today that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military team is to fly to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, the Vietnamese capital, for a turn-over ceremony before the remains are flown to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The repatriation is to be the 10th since August 1987, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> made a special effort to get Vietnamese help in resolving the missing in action, or MIA, issue. Since then, 184 remains have been returned and 56 to date identified as those of American servicemen, <PERSON> Trout </PERSON> said. A C-141 transport aircraft will fly a team from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Joint Casualty Resolution Center to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> airport. It will be headed by <PERSON> Lieut </PERSON>. Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spurgeon </PERSON>, who is the <ORGANIZATION> JCRC </ORGANIZATION> representative in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. Trout said the remains would be flown via <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military maintains a laboratory for the identification of <ORGANIZATION> MIA </ORGANIZATION> remains. Official statistics show 2,353 Americans still listed as missing from the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war, including 1,719 in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, 545 in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, 83 in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and six in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Catholic Priest to Form New Church for Blacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A prominent black Roman Catholic priest says he will start a new `` African American Catholic Congregation'' because the established church has failed to meet the spiritual and cultural needs of blacks. `` We must now take our destiny in our own hands and create forms of worship and parish life attuned to African Americans,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> archdiocese's director of evangelism. He and several hundred black Catholics will launch the new congregation on July 2 at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, he said. Although <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said in a statement he was sending Cardinal <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> detailed plans for the new congregation, members of <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON>'s staff said Monday no such word has reached the cardinal. <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> is out of town until Thursday. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> acknowledged that the new church `` does not have the approval, approbation or blessing'' of <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON>. The Rev. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who as archdiocesan secretary for parish life and worship is <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>' boss, said <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> has `` no authority, no authorization to start this congregation.'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said he could not say what action the archdiocese would take. But in general terms, if a priest conducts a service that deviates `` in liturgy or doctrine'' from church norms, he is considered to be in a state of schism from the church, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, 41, denied that the venture is a break from traditional Catholicism, and said it is an effort to develop `` an African-American <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> rite ... with our own clergy'' and the right to `` determine our own parish life and ministry.'' Creating a more meaningful ministry for blacks has been an issue for many American Catholic leaders. At their semiannual meeting at <ORGANIZATION> Seton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> last weekend, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hierarchy voted unanimously to implement a `` Pastoral Plan for Black Catholics'' developed by the 13 black bishops in this country. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, a convert to Catholicism, attracted national attention as pastor of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Avila </LOCATION> parish in southeast <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> when he began to incorporate into the traditional mass gospel music and preaching and worship styles familiar to many blacks. In his 12 years at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teresa </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, membership increased from 200 to 2,000, <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said. There are about 80,000 black Catholics in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> archdiocese.

<HEAD>Voyager 2 Finds Giant `Dark Spot' On Neptune; May Be Huge Storm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Voyager 2 spacecraft has discovered a 6,200-mile-wide dark spot on <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, and scientists believe it's a giant storm similar to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s hurricanes and <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot. The width is about one-fifth of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s 30,700-mile diameter, just as the 16,000-mile-wide Great Red Spot is about one-fifth the size of Jupiter, said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON>, a planetary scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. Voyager 2 was launched from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> in 1977, visited Jupiter in 1979, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Its twin, Voyager 1, explored Jupiter in 1979 and <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1980, and is now heading toward interplanetary space. `` I had gotten sort of discouraged from the Uranus encounter because Uranus was such a bland place,'' <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON> said Monday. `` So I'm happy to see such action on <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>.'' The top Voyager scientist was similarly excited. `` It's huge!'' <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> physicist and vice president <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said of the dark spot. While the robot probe is too far from <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> to detect winds within the spot, the spot seems to be a hurricane-like storm system similar to the Great Red Spot, which has 250 mph winds, said <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, chief scientist of the Voyager project for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Hurricanes on Earth are much smaller, measuring several hundred miles across. Unlike Earth's hurricanes, which break up after a week or two, <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot has remained intact at least since its discovery more than 350 years ago _ a mystery scientists have yet to explain. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s dark spot became apparent in photographs taken by <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON>'s television cameras in April, and faint hints of it can be seen in pictures made as early as January. The absence of continents on giant gas planets such as Jupiter and <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> may explain the persistence of the spots, <ORGANIZATION> Ingersoll </ORGANIZATION> said, adding that continents may help dissipate hurricanes on Earth. Voyager 2 is due to make its closest approach to <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, the solar system's fourth-largest planet, at 9 p.m. PDT Aug. 24. It will swoop 3,000 miles from the planet's north pole, by far the closest approach of any of the flybys during the spacecraft's `` grand tour'' of the giant, gaseous outer planets Five hours later, it will pass 25,000 miles from <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, one of two known Neptunian moons. Voyager 2 today was 2.66 billion miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and 58.98 million miles from <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, speeding toward that planet at 42,216 mph, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Murrill </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s dark spot is about 25 to 30 degrees latitude in the planet's southern hemisphere, <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON> said. Voyager 2 also discovered a much smaller, rapidly changing white spot _ about half the size of the dark spot _ at about 70 degrees south latitude, he said. The dark spot's color is n't yet known because scientists have n't processed a complete set of pictures through different color filters, <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON> said But <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said it is darker than <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s surrounding skies, which are blue-green because of methane in its mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot is believed to get its color from organic chemicals or possibly sulfur or phosphorus trapped within it, said <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON>. Besides the Great Red Spot, <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> contains dozens of smaller storm systems, which appear as white spots. <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> has similar storms, although they are less visible, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. Computer simulations suggest smaller storms combine to form giant storms such as the Red Spot and <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s dark spot, the scientists said. The existence of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s dark spot is mysterious because scientists did n't think the planet had enough heat to drive fierce winds, said <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON>. Unlike Jupiter, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, Uranus lacks enough internal heat to create big storms, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> usually is the eighth planet from the sun, and is about 30 times farther from the sun than Earth. But because <LOCATION> Pluto </LOCATION>'s elongated elliptical orbit sometimes brings it closer to the sun, <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> will be the ninth and most distant planet from the sun until the year 2007

 Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is sponsoring legislation to expand government health-care coverage to an additional 300,000 low-income pregnant women and 1.6 million children under the age of six. Co-sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, the legislation would cost an estimated $ 1 billion a year, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s office said. The measure would provide Medicaid coverage to pregnant women and children under age six in families whose income is at 185 percent of the poverty level _ $ 22,385 for a family of four. Under legislation enacted last year and being phased in this year and next, Medicaid coverage is guaranteed to pregnant women and infants under age 1 in families whose income is at the poverty level _ $ 12,100 for a family of four. The estimated cost of phasing in Medicaid coverage under <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s bill would be $ 790 million in fiscal 1990, and $ 1.2 billion in 1991, when the legislation is fully in place.

<HEAD>Boating Deaths At Record Low</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Recreational boating fatalities continued to drop last year to a record low of 946 deaths while the number of registered boats increased, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Coast Guard officials said the decline was the result of increased awareness of the danger of drinking while boating. Fatalities declined to 946 in 1988 from 1,036 in 1987, 1,066 in 1986 and 1,116 in 1985, the department said. The 1988 figure, which amounted to 5.5 deaths per 100,000 boats, was the lowest since the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> began keeping track of boating fatalities 28 years ago. The Coast Guard estimates that there were 17.3 million boats on the nation's waterways in 1988, an increase of 400,000 over the previous year.

<TEXT>
 Vandals have shattered eight ancient rock formations in eastern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s Fantasy Canyon and a $ 500 reward is being offered for information leading to convictions. The fragile formations of sandstone were among about 50 carved through the millenia by water erosion in the desert about 40 miles southeast of here, said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. `` Fantasy Canyon has a lot of the most unique rock formations you've ever seen in your life,'' he said. `` They're very fragile.'' The damage occurred between April 1, when agency employees were in the area, and the third week of April, when the damage was discovered, <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said. He said one damaged formation called Camel Rock was about 16 feet high and looked like the animal. `` The head came out, and it looked like it was looking back at you,'' he said. Another formation resembled a thin sheet of plywood about 6 feet high and 4 feet wide, <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said. `` That was shattered,'' he said. `` You just do n't see rock eroded like that.'' He said the formations, created between 38 million and 50 million years ago, once were beneath a sea. Turtle fossils and dinosaur bones have been found in the area. There were no signs that vandals used tools, but <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said physical strength would have been enough. `` If a person put their mind to it, they could break them pretty good,'' he said. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said the area is n't well known or advertised, but is revered by <PERSON> Vernal </PERSON> residents who take visitors there. `` They're really unhappy about it,'' he said.

 A mother jailed since August 1987 in a child custody dispute may not be freed until she produces her daughter for visits with her ex-husband or turns the child over to public authorities, a judge says. District of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> refused on Monday to release Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> plastic surgeon who was jailed 22 months ago on civil contempt of court charges. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> has refused to allow court-ordered visits between her daughter <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s ex-husband and the girl's father, contending that <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> sexually abused the girl. <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> has repeatedly denied those charges, and <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>'s whereabouts have been unknown An appeals court had directed <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> to review his December 1988 decision to keep <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> in jail. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s attorney, has argued that jailing her failed to coerce her into producing her daughter, and that the purpose has turned from coercion to punishment. But <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s ruling said, `` The order which causes -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- incarceration was and continues to be for coercive purposes only, and this has not changed due solely to the passage of time. `` No credible evidence has been received concerning the child's present condition or circumstances, notwithstanding <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s declaration that the the child is healthy, happy and healing,'' the judge's ruling <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> should remain in jail because she has not taken the opportunity to go free by turning the child over to the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s child custody division. <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> called <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s ruling `` flat-out wrong,'' adding that <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> `` feels the social services arrangement a booby trap by which the child can be turned over to the father.'' <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> said he hopes the ruling will force <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> to produce their daughter. `` What he's done here is that he has stated that there is an alternate method by which <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> can comply,'' <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON> said. `` This option was always available to her, and he has made that possibility very clear.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today was to review a bill to limit civil contempt jailings in the district. The bill, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., would alter charges of civil contempt to criminal contempt after a person has been jailed for 12 months The measure would be applied retroactively to <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s case and would guarantee her a jury trial.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> says she wo n't forget the hundreds of volunteers who in one week made her dream of a new home a reality in the heart of <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION>'s inner city. `` They'll never leave; their spirits will always be here,'' she said. `` It's a house made of love.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, 40, a social worker and divorced mother of three, owns one of six homes built last week by the Georgia-based Habitat for Humanity International. The site is near where 12 people died two years ago in the city's deadliest house fire Less than three weeks after the blaze, a house fire several blocks away killed six people. The death toll focused attention on housing ills for the largely minority population of the inner city. Now, Ms. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, who is black, sees the efforts of Habitat as part of a rebirth of the neighborhood where she has lived nearly a decade. `` This is a beautiful neighborhood,'' she said. `` This is going to be THE neighborhood someday.'' Former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Millard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, executive director of the organization, also think so. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Rosalynn </PERSON>, spent last week working on one of the homes. For the former president, it was the sixth year he has spent a week pounding nails and putting up walls in a Habitat home. `` I just know what's happened in other places where we've worked; it kind of rejuvenates the people,'' he said. `` The whole neighborhood tries to stay up with them. They kind of set a pattern.'' The crews in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> also renovated eight other homes last week. Habitat officials said similar work has occurred in about 150 communities around the world as part of efforts to build more than 3,000 homes for low-income people this year. Habitat, founded by <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> in 1976 and based in <LOCATION> Americus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, is an ecumenical Christian organization that uses volunteer labor and donated material to produce housing for needy people. The homes are sold for no profit with no-interest loans. The Milwaukee homes cost from $ 24,000 to $ 26,000, with principal payments on the 10-20 year mortgages to range from $ 100 to $ 250 a month. Each buyer must put in 500 hours of labor that's called `` sweat equity.'' The buyers work on several homes. `` It has a very positive impact for the families involved,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> and a board member of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Involvement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Beyond that, it's only going to have a neighborhood impact if there are other projects in the area, ... if the houses do not become oases in an area of dilapidated houses.'' He said census data show that vacant or substandard housing in the central city is as high as 25 to 30 percent. Officials estimate 800 dwellings are abandoned. Taking a break from installing siding on a house, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said the whole community should work toward eliminating substandard housing and homelessness by the year 2000. `` This is only one week, but what if we did it every week? What if everybody was concerned every week about everybody having a house? The problem would be solved in a very few years.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, another of the six new homeowners, said the project stirred interest in the black community. It also stirred their emotions. Ms. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 36, a school bus driver and nurse's aide who will live in the house with her two sons, said she arrived at her new home at 6:10 a.m. one day. No one was there. `` I was walking around, looking at the rooms, and I did n't even realize I was crying. The tears were just running down my face,'' she said.

The ship, located east of northern <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>, appeared stable but was taking on water and <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> officials did not know if it would sink, the Norwegian news agency <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> said. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the crew had reduced the leak `` and the situation somewhat normalized ... The Maxim Gorky is listing slightly.'' The Norwegian coast guard vessel <PERSON> Senja </PERSON> reached the ship early Tuesday and began rescuing 300 to 400 passengers from lifeboats and from ice floes in near-freezing temperatures and light rain about two miles from the Maxim Gorky. Some 225 people and the crew were said to still be on board. `` The passengers appear to be in good shape and humor ... rescue operations are somewhat difficult because the lifeboats are near the ice, which is moving,'' said <PERSON> Senja </PERSON> captain <PERSON> Kjell </PERSON> <PERSON> Tveiten </PERSON> via the ship's radio. About 575 passengers and 377 crew members were aboard the vessel, the Soviet Merchant Marine Emergency Preparedness office told Norwegian state radio. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> put the total at 953. <PERSON> Tveiten </PERSON> said <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> was listing to starboard and appeared bow-heavy but did not seem to be in immediate danger of sinking. Some passengers had climbed onto thick ice floes to walk to lifeboats and rafts lowered earlier from the damaged ship into the near-freezing waters, reports said. The Norwegian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said six rescue helicopters were dispatched and would begin carrying passengers to <LOCATION> Svalbard </LOCATION>, about a two-hour flight. Several other Soviet and Norwegian ships were within 300 miles of the distressed ship, which was in international waters. Hospitals in northern <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and on the Norwegian islands of <LOCATION> Spitsbergen </LOCATION>, of which <LOCATION> Svalbard </LOCATION> is the largest, were on emergency alert. The <LOCATION> Svalbard </LOCATION> hospital was awaiting Norwegian medical teams dispatched by helicopter, said reports. `` Maxim Gorky'' was built in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1969 and was sold to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1974. In recent summers, the liner has carried mostly West Germans on tours from <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> arranged by German tour operator <ORGANIZATION> NUR </ORGANIZATION>, news reports said.

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> is seeking talks with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to cool <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s mounting friction with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and help pull the economy out of its nosedive. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> announced the offer Monday after a 1 -LCB- - hour meeting with Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo He asked the Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> to carry the request for opening negotiations to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo, a sharp critic of <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s leftist Sandinista government, said he was `` going to think about this and will give an answer'' but refused to go into details. There was no immediate reaction from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The cardinal and <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, standing side by side, talked to reporters after their meeting. `` We have asked Cardinal <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo to ... take steps and mediate with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> so that a fluid dialogue can develop,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. `` We are willing to develop a dialogue with the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> government so foundations can be laid for normalizing relations between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The last time <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> held talks on improving relations was in June 1984 in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and they ended in deadlock. Many of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s difficulties stem from a 1981 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to support Contra rebels and cut off all financial aid to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. In 1985, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> prohibited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies from doing business with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Monday he much appreciated an open letter in which about 800 Latin American bishops recently asked <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to lift the embargo. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has argued that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' military ties with the Soviet bloc, their purported failure to carry out democratic reforms and their support of leftist rebels in neighboring <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> endanger security in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> claims its support of the Salvadoran guerrillas has only been moral _ not material. On June 12, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> accused <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> of trying to restrict foreign monitoring of February's presidential elections by requiring Americans _ for the first time _ to acquire entry visas as of July 1. On May 26, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> expelled two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats, accusing them of helping incite a wildcat strikes by teachers demanding higher pay and better working conditions. It was <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s second big strike in three weeks. Taxi drivers stopped working in many cities when prices of gasoline _ along with most other goods _ more than doubled following a sharp devaluation June 12 of the cordoba currency. The devaluation of the cordoba _ the 20th this year _ was part of an asuterity program announced by <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> Jan. 30 to try and check skyrocketing inflation that surpassed 20,000 percent last year.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>, who brought a new era of peace to the coal industry, presides over a union embroiled in its biggest labor dispute since he took office seven years ago. A 40-year-old lawyer and the son and grandson of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> coal miners, <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> has won respect from his members and from his adversaries, the coal industry's top executives. But some coal officials have complained that <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> has n't done enough to to bring an end to a wildcat strike that began June 12 in southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and by this week had spread to <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, idling more than 27,000 miners. The strikers say they wo n't go back until The <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> signs a contract with the union, which has been on strike against the company since April. `` We have no control over <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>. We have no control over Mr. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>. Yet we are being severely penalized by the strike. Our employees are being penalized,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Quenon </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Bituminous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the industry's main bargaining unit. `` I think the union leadership ought to exercise a leadership role and lead the miners back to work.'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> and chief union spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> did not return repeated phone calls over the past nine days seeking comment about the strike. On Monday, the union sent a telegram to miners advising them to return to work in accordance with a national labor contract signed by <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members. When <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> assumed his job in 1982, he was the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>'s fourth president in 10 years. His predecessors included <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, who went to prison for murdering a union rival; <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, whose health forced him to resign, leaving the union in disarray; and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Church </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who lost support when he negotiated a contract in 1981 that was rejected by the rank-and-file, leading to a 72-day strike, just four years after a 111-day walkout. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> took over a union known for its street brawls among union officials and for widespread wildcats _ one over grievance procedures that idled 70,000 miners in 1975 _ which the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> leaders appeared to be unable to control. He worked to focus the membership's efforts less on internal disputes and more on fighting the companies. He won broad new powers from the membership, including the union's first strike fund and the authority to call selective strikes. He used some of those powers to negotiate a contract in 1984 without an industrywide strike, the first time in 20 years, and again in 1988. An indication of his support was his re-election without opposition in 1987 to a second five-year term. `` You know, coal miners can get into knock-down and drag-out fights,'' said Local 340 President <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>. `` But when the chips are down, we know who the adversary is. The adversary is not within. The adversary is the coal operators who think they can reverse time and take us back.'' Just before his re-election, <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> discussed what he called the union's newfound course. `` We've become less reactionary,'' he said. `` The mine workers used to just wait for something to happen. Now, rather than just reacting to things, we're starting to plan.'' The union's strike against The <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> prompted last week's sympathy strike and is the second during <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>'s tenure. The first was a 15-month walkout by 1,100 miners against the <ORGANIZATION> A.T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, which ended with the union accepting the company's offer and the company being split up by its owners. Local officials said neither side won. With the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> strike, involving 1,800 miners in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, the union has jeopardized its newfound cooperative relationship _ and its $ 100 million strike fund. A <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> judge has ordered fines of $ 3 million because of the union's campaign of civil disobedience, and three union officials, including strike coordinator <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, were held for two weeks without bail in the <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, City Jail for orchestrating the picket-line activities. The three were released from jail Monday. The union also has been named in several damage suits filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> by companies that won back-to-work orders only to see the miners ignore them.

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a bill that would jail gun owners who do n't secure their loaded weapons. The action came in response to accidental shootings that killed three children and wounded four this month. `` The nation is watching to see what <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> does,'' Sen. <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Malchon </PERSON>, a co-sponsor of the legislation, said before Monday's 32-4 vote sent the bill to the House. `` It's probably at this point one of the first bills in the nation aimed at safety of children in access to guns,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. `` It did n't do everything that I wanted it to, but it's a bill that will significantly encourage safety, so I'm very pleased that we passed it.'' A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee was scheduled to consider the bill this morning as the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> began the second day of a three-day special session called by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. Accidental gunshots are the fifth-leading cause of death of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> children under age 14, and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has one of the three highest rates of accidental shootings in the country, according to <PERSON> Malchon </PERSON>, who proposed similar legislation two years ago. Under the bill, adults who fail to secure a loaded weapon that is used by a minor in an accidental shooting could be charged with a felony and sentenced to five years in prison and fined $ 5,000. It would be a misdemeanor if a minor displayed the gun or threatened someone with it. Opponents narrowed the bill's scope by exempting unloaded firearms and guns kept in cars or boats, and dropping the age of minors to under 16 from under 18. Senators also decided to require the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> to come up with a gun safety education plan by next spring rather than adding such a provision to the bill itself. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> spokeswoman, said the legislation was `` phony, unreal and a disservice to the people of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.'' She blamed the controversy on the media. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> felt that it needed to do something so that you folks would shut up,'' she told reporters. The House had approved a version of the bill during the regular session, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> failed to act on it. In addition to taking up the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also was scheduled to consider a bill that would punish anyone selling or loaning a weapon to an unsupervised minor without parental permission. The bill also would require gun owners to keep their firearms locked and empty. Another <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> proposal would require gun stores to post signs to warn gunowners about leaving loaded firearms within reach of children. A rash of accidental shootings this month prompted <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> to include the bill in the special session, which originally was called over a $ 2.4 billion turnpike expansion plan. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Claud </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON>, 4, died Saturday a week after he had shot himself at his family's home.

 A British journalist arrested twice for violating Chinese martial law said today that the pro-democracy movement remains alive in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> despite the government's efforts to suppress it. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> made the comments after arriving in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barron </PERSON>, Asian correspondent for the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities returned his passport Monday after holding it for a week following his second arrest. He was required to write a `` self-criticism'' for violating martial law restrictions on reporting. However, the 49-year-old journalist said he had not been expelled and was free to return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> any time. He was accompanied by his wife, daughter and three members of his television crew. `` We were free to leave when we liked, and we chose to leave today,'' he said. `` After our holiday, I hope to go back to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and continue reporting.'' On Monday, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> ordered the expulsion of the sixth foreign journalist in 10 days. Given 72 hours to leave was <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, an American working part-time for the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Morning News. He was in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on a tourist visa. Last week, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> expelled two Beijing-based <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> correspondents on charges of violating martial law. In addition, three journalists of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, who were not based in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, have been deported. After arriving in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> said he believes the pro-democracy movement, which the government has tried to put down beginning with the military assault in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on June 3-4, still has broad popularity. `` I do n't think the pro-democracy movement in the sense of mass feelings of change has been crushed,'' he told reporters at <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> airport after arriving from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Barron is based in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. `` In fact, when we drove to the airport this morning, we did see a few truckloads of troops, but we also saw at least one individual pass our bus and give the `` V'' sign ... the symbol of the pro-democracy movement. `` We interpreted it as a gesture of defiance ... or support for the pro-democracy movement,'' he said. <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> said he has covered <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> off and on for 15 years. He said he was first detained June 8 while he and his crew were filming a burned-out tank in the capital. He said they were forced to kneel on the road at gunpoint. Their equipment was seized and parts were smashed. His second detention a week ago was entirely different: `` We did self-criticisms, we were not abused in any way, and after three hours of interrogation, we were allowed to go to our hotel.'' Under martial law, foreign reporters are barred from talking to Chinese about martial law or taking pictures of soldiers. Journalists generally have ignored the regulations, however. <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> said he continued reporting after the second arrest, and no effort was made to stop him.

 More toxic chemicals are released into the air in <LOCATION> Toole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, than any other county in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says. In fact, the 68 million pounds of toxic chemicals released in that county each year account for all the toxic chemical releases into the air in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> that were reported to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, the federal agency said Monday. Other county hot spots for toxic industrial air pollution with more than 45 million tons of hazardous chemical released were: <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mobile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ascension </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. The county breakdown was included in a report that showed 2.7 billion pounds of toxic chemicals are released by industry into the air annually. The overall figure had been reported before, but the detailed breakdown by counties had not previously been available. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> provided no industrial plants in its summary, referring only to the individual counties. But the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, citing the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> report and other agency documents, said that <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rowley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, accounted for all of the reported toxic pollutants in <LOCATION> Tooele </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> also cited these companies: _ <ORGANIZATION> Avtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fibers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, 50.1 million pounds, in <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Courtaulds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LeMoyne </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, 42 million pounds, in <LOCATION> Mobile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> _ Triad Chemical, <LOCATION> Donaldsonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, 19.8 million pounds, and C.F Industries, also of <LOCATION> Donaldsonville </LOCATION>, 16.2 million pounds, in <LOCATION> Ascension </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said that 25 counties accounted for two-thirds of the discharges of toxic chemicals into surface water. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> had by far the largest volume, nearly 3.7 billion pounds, about two-thirds of which came from a single company. The chemical involved was usually sodium sulfate, which the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said it is planning soon to take off the toxic chemical list on the grounds that it poses no serious health threat. <LOCATION> Harrison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> had the next largest volume of discharges into surface water with 369 million pounds, followed by <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with 296 million pounds, according to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>.

 A standing ovation at the end of <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>'s Piano Concerto No. 1, 13 curtain calls and four encores marked <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON>'s triumphant return to the concert stage after 11 years. The <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON> was <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON>'s signature number after he won the first <ORGANIZATION> Tchaikovsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competition </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1958. He was an instant celebrity at age 23 and the first classical musician ever given a ticker-tape parade in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Two decades later, he began an 11-year hiatus saying his schedule of up to 100 concerts a year was too grueling. He has given two private performances since 1978 _ at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in December 1987 during Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit, and January 1988 and the Bob Hope Cultural Center in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Monday night, a crowd estimated at between 10,000 and 12,000 welcomed him back at the <ORGANIZATION> Mann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> open-air Tickets sold for up top $ 125 each. `` It's so good to be back with the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchestra </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> said following Monday morning's rehearsal. `` It seems like I never left.'' In addition to the <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> performed <PERSON> Liszt </PERSON>'s Piano Concerto No. 1 with <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Skrowaczewski </PERSON> guest conductor. <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON>'s piano was brought on stage and an uncustomary hush fell on the audience as they waited for the tall, lanky Texan to appear. He walked out and stood before a microphone. `` This is a very sentimental evening for me, an evening of remembrance of two old friends,'' he said. He was referring to <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ormandy </PERSON>, Hungarian-born music director of the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchestra </LOCATION> for 44 years, and impressario <PERSON> Fredric </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador, who ran the <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Fairmount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> from 1949 until his death in 1987. The name was changed from <ORGANIZATION> Robin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dell </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 to honor <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> joined forces with <PERSON> Ormandy </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> musicians within weeks of his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> triumph. `` I remember that time so well. We were all together then. Not just for one concert, but several concerts,'' he said. The relationship continued through years of concerts and recordings. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> became a close friend and was later an associate when <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> moved into the business world. <PERSON> Ormandy </PERSON> retired in 1980 and died five years later. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> worked hard to build the summer classical concert season, attended on each of the 18 concert dates by up to 10,000 people who only had to mail in a newspaper coupon for free tickets. Tickets sold for up to $ 125, with proceeds going to the summer classical program. General admission tickets for spots on the grassy hillside behind the covered covered ampitheater sold for $ 12.50. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> `` wanted everyone on the face of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> to believe in classical music,'' <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> said, which was why the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Orchestra summer series was so important to him.

 <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> coach <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Switzer </PERSON> bid an emotional farewell to college football, ending turmoil over recruiting violations and the arrests of five players on rape, shooting and drug charges. `` I finally decided the time has come for new leadership,'' <PERSON> Switzer </PERSON> said Monday. `` I will never coach at another institution. I will never coach at another college level. I promise you that.'' His resignation ended a 16-year career in which he brought the <ORGANIZATION> Sooners </ORGANIZATION> three national titles and established the fourth best all-time winning percentage. Officials scheduled a news conference today to name a successor. Gov. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> issued a statement praising <PERSON> Switzer </PERSON> for posting `` an unparalleled record of success in college football history.'' <PERSON> Switzer </PERSON>, 52, had been under pressure since the school's football program was placed on three years' probation by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in December and after five players were charged with felonies. One player was charged with wounding another in a dormitory shooting, three players were charged with raping a woman in a dormitory and one player was charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine. The state's three largest newspapers and the school's student paper had called for <PERSON> Switzer </PERSON>'s resignation, and the 1949 team canceled a 40-year reunion because of the problems. `` It's no fun anymore. I'm drained. I do n't have the energy level to compete in this arena today,'' said <PERSON> Switzer </PERSON>, who has complained recently about the impact of drugs on college athletics. <PERSON> Switzer </PERSON> also said he was frustrated by <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> rules that do not `` recognize the financial needs of young athletes. `` We have created a system that does not permit me or the program to buy a pair of shoes or a decent coat for a player whose family ca n't afford these basic necessities. `` How can any coach stick to these rules when a young man's father dies many miles away and the son has no money for a plane ticket home to the funeral? <PERSON> Switzer </PERSON> finished with a 157-29-4 record, an .844 winning percentage. His teams won national championships in 1974, 1975 and 1985.

<HEAD>AMA Urged to Back Mandatory Cholesterol Labels on Food</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Food labels would be required to include the product's cholesterol content, caloric value and the specific source of all vegetable oils used under a proposal presented to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The plan, offered by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s annual policymaking convention, also would mandate saturated fat content listings on labels. Cholesterol and such fats have been linked to cardiovascular problems. A related resolution presented Monday asked the association to seek truthful labeling of food products, along with warnings regarding sodium, cholesterol and the additive content of packaged food products. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> would call upon the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to investigate the advertising practices of food manufacturers who present their products as low in sodium or cholesterol under the second plan, submitted by Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfano </PERSON>, a delegate from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abdominal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgeons </ORGANIZATION>. Both resolutions were referred to an <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> committee that was to vote on whether to recommend that the association's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> adopt them as policy. A critic said the measures were vague and would provide useless and misleading information to millions of people over age 60 whose cholesterol levels can not be altered by what they eat. But supporters say many other consumers would be well-served by such labeling. `` Health conscious consumers are often misled by the advertising and labeling of common food products such as canned soups labeled as ` low sodium' which contain a substantial sodium content but are only lower in sodium than the manfacturer's regular line of soups,'' <PERSON> Alfano </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> can clear up the confusion by asking the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to assist the consumer by requiring more specific food labeling, he told committee members. Dr. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Briet </PERSON>, an alternate delegate, presented the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> plan and said he supported <PERSON> Alfano </PERSON>'s resolution. Cholesterol is a waxy substance that can contribute to clogged arteries and heart disease, depending on what type of fatty proteins carry it through the blood. It is produced naturally in the body and develops from eating food with saturated fats or pure cholesterol, such as eggs, butter and animal fat. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has implemented labeling standards that allow foods to be billed as cholesterol-reduced even though they still have large amounts of cholesterol, <PERSON> Briet </PERSON> said. `` Nowhere do they require the source of the oils to be labeled,'' he said. Some plant fats, such as coconut and palm oils, contain high amounts of saturated fatty acids that can help cholesterol form, and food manufacturers like <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have taken steps to remove such oils from their products. Dr. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mineur </PERSON>, an internist and delegate from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, noted that there is an ongoing debate over so-called `` good'' and `` bad'' cholesterol. He said the proposals would be useless unless they called for labels to differentiate between the two. `` Quit this damn hype'' that all types of cholesterol are bad for everybody, <PERSON> Mineur </PERSON> told the committee. `` Bad'' cholesterol is carried through the bloodstream by low-density lipoproteins linked to the buildup of harmful deposits in the arteries. `` Good'' cholesterol is carried by high-density lipoproteins that researchers believe suck up excess cholesterol in the bloodstream. Furthermore, <PERSON> Mineur </PERSON> argued, reducing cholesterol consumption is only useful for those under age 60. There's no evidence that people older than that can lower their risk of heart disease by altering their intake of fats, he said.

 A company handling auctions for the federal government is under investigation for the loss of millions of dollars in profits, reports said. An investigation by federal authorities centers on allegations that <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> took auction profits through bill padding and fraud, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday evening. The <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>, Calif.-based company has a contract with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to recover, maintain and sell seized or forfeited personal property, usually through auctions. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wortham </PERSON> is presenting his findings to a federal grand jury here, The <ORGANIZATION> Beaumont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Wortham </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> prohibited him from discussing any investigation. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Canpafio </PERSON> said the company is working with the government in the investigation. `` We've been subpoenaed and we've provided documents,'' <PERSON> Canpafio </PERSON> said. First word on the investigation was in April at a hearing before a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chaired by Rep. <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON> said lax accounting controls account for the loss of millions of dollars in the Customs' auctions. In fiscal 1988, Customs agents made more than 53,000 property seizures with a domestic value of about $ 1.1 billion. The investigation began after area banker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Talbert </PERSON> complained of fees charged by <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> to sell a vehicle seized in a drug-related arrest in <LOCATION> Lumberton </LOCATION> in 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumberton </ORGANIZATION> had a lien of $ 4,700 to $ 5,000 on the Chevrolet Suburban, <PERSON> Talbert </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Talbert </PERSON>, who worked at the bank, said Customs offered to buy the car for $ 4,500 but later told him it would be auctioned and money left after expenses would go to the bank. Customs estimated the vehicle's value at about $ 8,500. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> auctioned it in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> for $ 4,300, and charged $ 700 to tow the vehicle 90 miles to the auction and a $ 1,400 commission. The bank was left with about $ 1,900. `` I was mad,'' <PERSON> Talbert </PERSON> said. `` I wrote to the company, asking for a detailed statement of their expenses.'' <PERSON> Talbert </PERSON> also wrote <PERSON> Wortham </PERSON>. After <PERSON> Wortham </PERSON>'s office investigated the sale, the company sent the bank an additional $ 1,000, he said. The investigation widened in January when authorities obtained a search warrant for <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Lawton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, offices to obtain transcripts on all Customs auctions for the past three years. In affidavits, Customs agents said <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> employees contended the company billed Customs for maintaining and storing seized property for as long as three months after the property was disposed. Agents also reported <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> withheld information stored in one computer when agents served a subpoena issued by a grand jury in <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION> requesting all business records concerning <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>'s contract with Customs Its commissioner, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>, said the agency loses money on its auctions because Customs warehouses store more than just fancy cars and boats. `` When you lump all of our forfeitures together including those made let's say of fruit that does n't meet <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Food and Drug Administration -RRB- rules or blue jeans that violate a quota or mismark, then we do n't make a profit,'' he said. Some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> say there is no excuse for Customs to lose money on their auctions, especially when the seized property is acquired at no cost. `` Either the auctions are rigged or else they're being very poorly run,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulze </PERSON>, R-Pa.

 The man mentioned as <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s most likely congressional successor urged the former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker to try to retain his seat, saying he was still the best representative for the district. `` Nobody has a right to tell the people of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> and this community who their congressman ought to be,'' state Sen. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Parmer </PERSON> told reporters Monday. `` The people of this community ought to make that choice. And I am persuaded, having talked to them, that if they have that option they will overwhelmingly re-elect <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as the congressman from the 12th District.'' <PERSON> Parmer </PERSON> said his fellow Fort Worth Democrat and longtime friend either should remain in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or, if he fulfills his promise to resign, run again for the seat in a special election. About 30 supporters at a Saturday breakfast urged <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to put his name on the ballot in a special election for the 12th District seat, the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The newspaper said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> neither encouraged nor discouraged the effort to draft him but told supporters he `` would think about running,'' according to some who were at the meeting. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the congressman was gratified by supporters' suggestions, but `` is not encouraging this and his plans have not changed.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> resigned May 31 as speaker and said he'd give up his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat by the end of June to end a furor over allegations he violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics rules. `` He is proceeding with the transition'' into private life by the end of June, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, though no resignation date has been set. <PERSON> Parmer </PERSON> had been mentioned most often as the likeliest Democrat to run for the post <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has held since 1954. But at a news conference in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> earlier Monday, <PERSON> Parmer </PERSON> said he was sticking with his announced plan to challenge Republican <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> in 1990. <PERSON> Parmer </PERSON> waited for his afternoon appearance at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Meacham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> airport to throw his support behind <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` The vast majority of people in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> believe that while <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> may have made some mistakes of judgment, as <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> has admitted ... it did not warrant the kind of penalty or price that he is talking about paying,'' he said. Asked whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> still planned to leave office, <PERSON> Parmer </PERSON> said, `` I would say that he said neither yes, nor no. He simply listened to what I had to say.''

 Attorneys for <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> rested their case after calling 35 witnesses but passing up the chance to have the defendant testify in the 5-month-old `` Night Stalker'' murder trial. Defense attorney <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said Monday the decision on whether to testify was left to <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> and he decided not to take the witness stand. The 29-year-old drifter from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is charged with 13 murders and 30 related felonies in a crime wave that terrorized <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> during the summer of 1985. Pentagrams, a symbol of devil worship, were found at some murder scenes and the assailant gouged out the eyes of one victim. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> is a self-proclaimed devil worshiper who once shouted `` Hail Satan'' in court. A jailer testified that he used his own blood to draw a pentagram on the floor of his cell. During the defense's month-long presentation, attorneys called witnesses who gave <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> alibis for some of the killings. Most notably, <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>' father testified that the defendant was home in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> when two of the slayings occurred. The defense also entered 65 pieces of evidence and attacked the credibility of witnesses who identified <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> as the shaggy haired killer who entered homes through unlocked windows and doors. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> said he planned to begin presenting rebuttal witnesses today. He said his rebuttal should take about a week. The prosecution has presented 137 witnesses and 521 pieces of evidence. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said it was unlikely the defense would call any more witnesses after rebuttal. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON> scheduled final arguments to begin July 10, after the jury takes a week vacation. The case appears headed for a conclusion far sooner than the two years anticipated when the trial began. But <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> said he was still disturbed by the four years that have elapsed since <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> was arrested. The trial followed years of pretrial motions and a lengthy preliminary hearing. `` We have not done this efficiently,'' <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> said, adding he hoped the court system would learn from the case that `` we ca n't take forever to try these cases.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> has officially changed its name in English to the Union of <LOCATION> Myanmar </LOCATION> and renamed the capital of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Yangon </LOCATION>, the state-run Working People's Daily said. Also Monday, the military government tightened controls on political literature and reopened primary schools nationwide, one year after all classrooms were closed in the wake of pro-democracy demonstrations. The government said it would reopen junior high schools, high schools and universities but has not given specific dates. In the law changing <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s name, the nationality _ <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> _ also was changed to <LOCATION> Myanmar </LOCATION>. The word for <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> language are both pronounced <LOCATION> Myanmar </LOCATION>. The names of states, towns and other geographical sites are to be written in English according to the Burmese pronunciation, the law says. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, for example, is to be written as <LOCATION> Yangon </LOCATION>, which is the Burmese pronunciation of the capital. The military rulers who seized power in September while brutally putting down the popular uprising for democratic reforms had already dropped the term `` <LOCATION> Socialist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>,'' calling the country the Union of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> in English. The move was an apparent attempt to appease a populace angered by a quarter century of ruinous socialist policies. The latest change in the country's name, government officials say, is to better reflect <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s ethnic diversity. The term <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> connotes <PERSON> Burman </PERSON> _ the dominant race in the country _ to the exclusion of ethnic minorities. Several minority groups have been fighting for greater autonomy from the central government for four decades. The government on Monday increased penalties against violators of a 1962 law on publications, increasing maximum prison terms from three to seven years and fines from $ 320 to $ 4,800 for those who publish material without proper registration. The act says printing presses must be registered with authorities and forbids falsification of facts in declarations by printers and publishers. <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Muang </PERSON>'s military council has promised general elections next year and allowed the formation of opposition political parties, and many of the 200 parties have published anti-government pamphlets without official permission.

<HEAD>Foley Sees Raises For Judiciary; Tied to Congressional Raise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said federal judges and senior executive branch employees should get pay raises. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said that before any action is taken on the pay boosts for judges and executive branch employees he would wait for a report that's expected to recommend a pay increase for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The report, likely to be completed this summer, is expected to suggest a ban on speaking fees and other honoraria in exchange for the pay raise. `` It may well be that they'll recommend that we phase out honorariums over a period of years with perhaps an increase over a period of years starting in the next <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said Monday during a political fund-raiser in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` But in any event, whatever happens, I want to see this Congress propose and send to the president an increase for judges and for senior civil servants in the executive branch.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s comments are the first indication that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is willing to reopen the politically volatile issue. The House in February, faced with a public outcry, killed a 51 percent pay increase for judges, senior executives and legislators in what was seen as a major defeat for then-Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Since the vote, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been pressured to increase the salary of senior executive branch employees and federal judges, whose salaries traditionally are tied to those of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. With the renewed interest in ethics in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been considering a ban on speaking fees and other outside sources of income. Judicial and executive branch employees already are forbidden from accepting most speaking fees and other outside income.

 Federal officials say they hope an offer of higher pay will attract and keep air traffic controllers at the nation's busiest towers and control centers. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> announced that 2,100 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> controllers, technicians and safety inspectors at 11 facilities in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> areas will get pay raises of up to 20 percent. `` The air traffic controllers in the busiest centers of this country will be some of the highest paid people in the federal government,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said Monday at <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> offices near <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the nation's busiest. `` I've been to those centers and frankly I think those jobs deserve that kind of compensation.'' Many <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> control rooms have been chronically understaffed since former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> fired some 11,400 air traffic controllers during an illegal strike in August 1981. The new plan was criticized as `` a Band-Aid on a hemorrhage'' by <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spickler </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He said the raises would cover only a fraction of a nationwide work force of 16,000. The union was certified to represent the nation's 7,000 air traffic controllers in 1987, replacing the <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controllers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which was decertified after the 1981 strike. `` It will address short-term problems,'' union spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Dresden </PERSON> said of the wage plan. `` We would hope that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> would look at fair compensation for all controllers.'' <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials say the agency has difficulty staffing the 11 facilities with qualified workers because of high living costs, complex operations and other unattractive features. In addition, many workers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> are close to retirement age, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which has been urging higher salaries at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, applauded the program. `` We believe this action is an encouraging step toward improving <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>'s ability to efficiently handle commercial air traffic at the nation's busiest airport,'' the carrier said. <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said the program will cost an extra $ 5 million a year from department funds, requiring minor cutbacks in other programs. The 5-year demonstration project will be made permanent if it is successful, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. Top-level air traffic controllers now make $ 60,000 to $ 65,000 a year, including overtime, before the raises. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said union representatives indicate the program is already working at targeted facilities. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has received a lot of applications for the positions since the program was announced in March, and those applying are highly skilled. The program earlier this year survived attempts by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to restrict it workers at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> and limit raises to 10 percent of base pay, department officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> facilities affected by the incentive plans include air traffic control centers in <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Ronkonkoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; and the <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> international airport towers and terminal radar approach control facilities. The program also covers approach-control facilities at <LOCATION> Westbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; and flight standards district offices in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Farmingdale </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stream </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Teterboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>.

 Jurors in the trial of a man charged with stabbing his wife to death heard a tape recording of the woman's plea for help, followed by her husband telling her she was `` bleeding just like a stuck hog.'' <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavers </PERSON>, 48, is charged with murder in the May 13, 1988, stabbing deaths of his wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, and 11-year-old stepdaughter, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. The tape played Monday was found by police in a recorder under pillows in the stepdaughter's room. It contained a 90-minute recording of the domestic dispute that culminated in Mrs. <PERSON> Lavers </PERSON>' terrifying screams `` I'm dying,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Lavers </PERSON> was heard saying, just after she allegedly was stabbed by her husband. `` I know you are,'' he said. `` Please help me,'' she said. `` You're bleeding just like a stuck hog. I love you so much,'' he said. The victims' relatives sat fighting back emotion in the front row of the spectators' section as the tape was played. An elderly woman later identified as one of Mrs. <PERSON> Lavers </PERSON>' relatives broke down in tears and was led out. There was no discernible reaction by jurors, who followed the tape with a transcript. <PERSON> Lavers </PERSON>, 48, voluntarily removed himself from the <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> courtroom while the tape was played. He returned for the defense portion of the case, in which public defender <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinle </PERSON> called only one witness _ a police officer who said <PERSON> Lavers </PERSON> appeared `` out of it'' when he was arrested and booked. <PERSON> Steinle </PERSON> is attempting to show that <PERSON> Lavers </PERSON> was intoxicated when he stabbed the women, acted without premeditation and should be found guilty of a lesser crime. The trial resumes Wednesday.

 Eighteen Chinese refugees arrived by boat in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> last week after fleeing the political turmoil in their country, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said today. <PERSON> Karola </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, deputy representative of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees, said the 16 men and two women arrived June 13 aboard a wooden boat in <LOCATION> Batanes </LOCATION> province, 410 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. She said the agency told its regional offices last week that Chinese might try to flee because of the suppression of dissent following the June 4 killing of hundreds of unarmed pro-democracy protesters by troops in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Miss <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said she did not know where the Chinese boat people came from but would ask <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> authorities to grant custody to her agency. The Chinese, who did not have travel papers, were taken to army headquarters in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and were to be interviewed by immigration officials, she said. `` To me, they are asylum-seekers,'' Miss <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. `` We have been alerted of an outflow from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the turmoil. But it would be very difficult to say if there will be more.'' Also today, two <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspapers reported that the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> had received queries from Chinese students seeking asylum but discouraged them for fear of offending the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government. <LOCATION> Malaya </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified source in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> as saying the decision to put off applicants was taken on the recommendation of <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> diplomats in the Chinese capital. `` It would not be favorable for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> because we do not have the muscle to do what the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is doing,'' the newspapers quoted the source as saying. `` We do n't have a bargaining chip with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has sharply criticized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for sheltering Chinese dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and his wife in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has deplored the violence in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> but stopped short of criticizing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leadership. Last year, she visited <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and received assurances from senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> would not support Filipino Communist rebels seeking to establish a Marxist state in this country.

The buses, including three from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, were scheduled to arrive today in <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, near the small town of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, where ceremonies Wednesday will honor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>. The three men were shot to death June 21, 1964, after they had gone to inspect a church burned by the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. Their bodies were found 44 days later in an earthen dam. `` It is important to commemorate the sacrifices that were made in the civil rights movement,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON>, 37. The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, attorney came up with the idea for the convoy last winter after watching the movie `` Mississippi Burning,'' a dramatization of the slayings and the resulting investigation. `` It gives us the opportunity to bring into the consciousness of the whole country the need for a continuing commitment to civil rights,'' <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> said. Seven men eventually were convicted in federal court of violating the three men's civil rights. Another defendant pleaded guilty, eight were acquitted and the cases against the three others ended in mistrials. Murder charges were dropped in state court. The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Project is sponsored by the <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Schwerner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, which is co-chaired in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> by Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> and seven others, and in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> by Secretary of State <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mopus </PERSON>. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>, the first black mayor of the nation's fifth-largest city, will fly to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> with about 150 people Wednesday to address a `` commemoration of the past'' at <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, former executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION>, and members of the victims' families also will speak. The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> convoy will leave <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> on Thursday as will a south-to-north convoy that will stop in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for meetings with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a rally at the Capitol Friday. The convoy will go to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Saturday for a ceremony at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Divine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Several participants said the trip will provide valuable insight. `` To know where you're going, you've got to know where you came from,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, 67, a curator at the Afro-American Historical and Cultural Museum in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. He said he was struck by the small proportion of whites boarding the buses in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` When <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> marched, there was 25 to 30 percent whites,'' he said. `` Here, it's maybe 1 percent. That will give you something to think about. That will give you an idea where the country is headed. I'm not being bitter. I'm just telling you the truth.'' But <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON>, the organizer, said he hoped the trip would demonstrate that the civil rights legacy belongs to all Americans. `` The lessons we intend to present this week are lessons which the country must learn, which is that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance, that the civil rights movement, though it was focusing on the rights of blacks, was an American movement, a patriotic movement.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s official executioner, a skilled swordsman who has dispatched more than 600 convicted criminals, says beheading is less difficult than chopping off the hands of thieves. `` Frankly, it's easier to chop off a head since this act means the end of the story for the criminal,'' <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sayyaf </PERSON>, 60, said in an interview with the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Medina </ORGANIZATION>. `` Chopping off a hand needs more courage, since you are cutting off a part of the body of an individual who is to survive,'' he said. The act requires `` very skilled attention to ensure that the sword does not slip or cut in the wrong place,'' <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> said in the interview, which was republished by a Dubai-based English-language newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> Khaleej </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. His name has an odd ring in Arabic: <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> means `` happy'' and <PERSON> Al-Sayyaf </PERSON> `` swordsman executioner.'' He changed his second name when he was appointed to the job more than 35 years ago. The executioner says he does n't suffer remorse for his victims since he is carrying out Islamic justice as required by the Koran, the holy book of Islam. The Koran decrees that convicted murderers be beheaded and thieves lose a hand. Saudi authorities last year ruled that drug smugglers also should be executed. <PERSON> Al-Sayyaf </PERSON> started out as a farmer, but joined the Saudi army at the age of 20. He said that `` watching executioners'' as they beheaded criminals publicly after Friday prayer sessions became his favorite hobby. He later applied for the job of `` sayyaf'' which carried a salary of $ 36 a month, plus an additional $ 133 `` for each head.'' <PERSON> Al-Sayyaf </PERSON> said he carried out his first execution at age 23, beheading three criminals and `` earning 1,500 riyals'' -LRB- $ 399 -RRB-. `` I always look forward to the opportunity to chop off more heads so that I can earn more money,'' he said. `` Over a period of time it became a very easy sort of job ... In fact I felt it was easy to do an execution,'' he added. `` I have chopped off the heads of more than 600 criminals and cut off 60 hands of thieves.'' <PERSON> Al-Sayyaf </PERSON> said he first slices off the upper part of a convict's shirt with his sword to expose the kneeling victim's neck Then he uses a single swift stroke that sends blood gushing and the head rolling on the sand. But he uses a pistol for executing women in order to avoid having to cut off their clothing and reveal naked flesh. <PERSON> Al-Sayyaf </PERSON> admits that he often has sleepless nights before executions `` worrying that I might fail.'' But once the beheading is over, he feels `` delighted and satisfied'' for having put an end to `` what's against the law of God.'' `` I was very happy when I executed a drug trafficker,'' <ORGANIZATION> Al-Medina </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. These days, those awaiting execution have their eyes covered by a black blindfold. That was introduced after `` I chopped off the head of one convict and it fell directly in front of the second, who suddenly collapsed and fell to the ground and died of a heart attack.'' His most memorable executions took place in 1979, when he beheaded 12 convicts in one session. They were all members of a group of Moslem fundamentalists who seized the Grand Mosque in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, Islam's holiest shrine, in an attempt to topple the government. <PERSON> Al-Sayyaf </PERSON> has married 24 times and fathered 25 sons and daughters. Under Islam, a man is permitted four wives. He says his grim job does n't affect his social life. <PERSON> Al-Sayyaf </PERSON> has been training one of his sons, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, to be his successor. `` I have not yet given <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> the opportunity to carry out an execution but I do feel that he knows the job,'' he said. `` A number of my relatives are reluctant at the thought of my training them.''

<HEAD>3 Dead, Curfew Imposed to Restore Order in Kazakhstan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At least three people were killed and more than 50 injured in the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> in brawling, arson and rioting spawned by ethnic and economic problems, a government spokesman said today. Hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> soldiers and extra police were sent to Novy Uzen, a city of 55,000 people near the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, and a curfew was imposed to restore order, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> told a news briefing. It was the third instance in six weeks in the vast central <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> region in which ethnic tension and economic frustration have spilled over into violence. In the worst violence, about 100 people were killed in neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> this month. The region is being buffeted by a rapidly increasing population, pollution, a lack of jobs, an increase in ethnic divisions and a resurgence of Islam. A man who answered the telephone at an emergency headquarters set up in <LOCATION> Novy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uzen </LOCATION> said a 9 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew had been imposed. The man, who identified himself only as <PERSON> Murzagalev </PERSON>, said there had been a demonstration today but refused to elaborate. <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> said since the violence began Friday night, three people had died and 53 were hurt. He did not identify the dead or injured, or say how they died. Fifty-seven people were arrested, he said. The spokesman said much of the violence appeared to be aimed at traders from the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> region, located on the opposite side of the Caspian Sea. Armenians, Georgians and Azerbaijanis are the main ethnic groups in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> said he did not know what group was targeted. More than 700 of them, mostly women and children, were evacuated from Novy Uzen, he said. `` They're now under heavy guard at a bus station 14 kilometers -LRB- 8.5 miles -RRB- from the city, and the roads to the station are blocked,'' he said. <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> said about 7,000 people gathered Monday in the town's main square demanding that cooperative businesses be closed and people from the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republics be sent home `` Two battalions of Interior soldiers were brought in to stop the unrest,'' <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> said. `` The crowd was dispersed, but it broke into several large groups of youths armed with pipes and stones, and other objects. They went along the streets, organizing brawls, pogroms and arson.'' Reports on Monday said youths had tried unsuccessfully to seize a police station, and that they were armed with guns and gasoline bombs. Cooperatives are privately owned businesses that have been permitted under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reforms to provide an alternative to the state-run economy. But many Soviets suspect cooperative owners of profiteering and serving as a front for organized crime. In <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, officials have blamed the violence on outside instigators. But members of the Uzbek majority and <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> minority, the target of most of the violence, have said overcrowding and unemployment contributed to it. More than 10,000 Meskhi Turks were evacuated from cities in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to a refugee camp as a protective measure. Authorities on Monday announced a program to create 200,000 jobs, reduce pollution and diversify agriculture, which is now based on cotton production, in an effort to reduce tensions in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION>, a republic south of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, mobs rampaged through the streets in early May with demands that cooperatives be closed and Armenian traders be forced to leave the area. The first outbreak of ethnic violence under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was in <ORGANIZATION> Alma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> capital, in December 1986. Rioters burned vehicles and shops to protest the replacement of the republic <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, a Kazakh, with an ethnic Russian.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has struck down a law allowing videotaped testimony by child victims of sexual abuse. The court Monday declared the 1987 law unconstitutional because it deprives the accused of the right to confront their accusers at trial. The law, enacted by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> over Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s veto, allows the defense to cross-examine the child witness about the videotaped testimony during the trial but not during the taping itself `` Cross-examination often depends for its effectiveness on the ability of counsel to punch holes in a witness' testimony at just the right time, in just the right way,'' said Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stamos </PERSON>, citing a 1988 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in a case from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> is one of several states that have adopted so-called `` child shield'' laws intended to protect young victims of sexual abuse from the trauma of testifying in open court and to minimize their fright and confusion. The law applied only to certain sexual offenses committed against a child 12 or younger, but in declaring it unconstitutional the justices said they were worried it would be expanded to include the elderly or handicapped. In vetoing it, the governor predicted it would be declared unconstitutional. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned the conviction of an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> man who was made to testify behind a one-way screen to prevent his accusers from seeing him. He had been found guilty of molesting two 13-year-old girls. The high court said the man's rights to a fair trial and to confront his accusers appeared to have been violated.

 Conservative leader <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> today was given three days to form a new government, and a leftist alliance rejected his offer to join a coalition. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>' center-right <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> finished first in Sunday's elections, defeating Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> But <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> failed to win a majority needed to govern. President <PERSON> Christos </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartzetakison </PERSON>, as outlined by the constitution, today gave <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> three days to form a governing coalition. If he is unable to form a government, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s party will be given the same opportunity. The Coalition of Left and Progress, a leftist-communist coalition that finished third, said it would consider a governing coalition with <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s party if the premier resigned as party leader. But the leftists rejected an offer from <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> to form a new government. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> refused to say what he planned to do following the rejection of his coalition offer. If neither of the top two finishers in the election can form a government, the president will ask the third place <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> and Progress to form a government. If all three fail, the president appoints a caretaker government to prepare for new elections. The <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> has hinted it would seek to lead a leftist coalition if it was offered the exploratory mandate. New Democracy gained 44.37 percent of Sunday's vote and 144 seats, seven short of a majority in the 300-member Parliament. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s party took 39 percent and 125 seats. The <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> and Progress, an alliance of Communist and Greek Left parties, received 13 percent and 29 seats. On Monday, <PERSON> Mitstotakis </PERSON> asked the leftist alliance to join him in an interim government with a limited mandate confined to cleaning up the financial scandals that have tainted the <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> government. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> said the partnership would last `` only a few months,'' until those guilty of involvement in the scandals were punished. Then he would call new elections. `` I hope that all other parties will do all in their power to prevent the scandals from being written off,'' <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Harilaos </PERSON> <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON>, the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and president of the leftist alliance, said his group wants to form a leftist government that would exclude people tainted by scandal. <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON> said it would consider forming a government with the <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> if <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, who has ruled since 1981, resigned as its leader. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and senior members of his party have been accused of being involved in the $ 200 million fraud, forgery and embezzlement scheme at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, the owner of the bank, is detained in prison in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pending the hearing of an extradition request by the Greek government.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial plants are spewing 360 million pounds of suspected cancer-causing chemicals into the air annually with releases from each of the 30 biggest polluters exceeding 1 million pounds, according to government statistics. The pollution figures were released Monday by a private environmental group and confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which provided the raw statistics based on information provided by industry under a fledgling public disclosure law. `` Industries are using the sky as a garbage dump to dispose of hundreds of millions of pounds of unregulated cancer-causing chemicals,'' said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheiman </PERSON>, author of the report from the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> identified more than 1,500 companies in 46 states that release substantial amounts of at least one of 13 cancer-causing chemicals into the air. Thirty of the companies reported releasing more than 1 million pounds of a particular carcinogen and several had releases five to nine times that amount, the group said. While the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> did not challenge the statistics, it stopped short of attempting to estimate the health risks posed by such releases. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Elkins </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s toxics programs, said the raw figures can not measure individuals' health risks because they do not take into account exposure levels. A spokesman for one of the companies cited, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wichita </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, said that while the company's <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> plant releases 2.3 million pounds of trichloroethylene, the releases are so diluted `` the chemical is undetectable'' in the air. The spokesman, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> nevertheless is trying to develop a substitute for the chemical. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> plant ranked ninth among the biggest polluters cited in the <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> report. The most releases of any of the 13 carcinogens examined came from the plants of <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, N.Y. The company reported 8.9 million pounds of methylene chloride were released during 1987, according to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> figures. Other companies which reported emissions of more than 2.5 million pounds of the chemical, which the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has classified as a `` probable human carcinogen,'' were <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vernon </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; the <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Shadeland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; and <ORGANIZATION> Hadco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Derry </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Maas </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said today that the pharmaceutical company is more than halfway toward its self-imposed goal of cutting its 5 million pounds of emissions in half by the end of 1989. Air sampling around the plant's perimeter in 1987 found no detectable levels of methylene chloride, and within the plant the chemical remains well below dangerous levels, he said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> attorney, acknowledged that the raw figures provide no assessment of health risk to residents near the plants, but maintained `` these pollutants have to be considered dangerous at any level of exposure.'' Only one of the 13 chemicals, benzene, is subject to any <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> regulation covering routine industrial releases. The chemicals are among the long list of toxic substances for which regulations are being developed. In a separate development Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> made public new details about the release of the many toxic industrial pollutants _ not only carcinogens _ into the air, providing for the first time a list of counties where such releases are greatest. The agency said 68 million pounds of hazardous chemicals are released into the air in 1987 in <LOCATION> Tooele </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, more than in any other county in the country. The releases were attributed to <ORGANIZATION> Amax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magnesium </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rowley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Other county `` hotspots'' for toxic industrial air pollution with more than 45 million tons of hazardous chemical released were <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mobile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ascension </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> findings mirror many of the conclusions reached earlier this month by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., after the congressman compiled estimates on the release of carcinogens at industrial plants from figures dating back to the early 1980s But while <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s data from the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> were based on `` rough working estimates,'' the latest figures were based on actual release numbers provided by the companies involved under a public disclosure law that went into effect last year. Among the findings of the <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> in its analysis of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s statistics were: _ At least 1,600 industrial plants and facilities in 46 states release significant amounts of suspected cancer-causing chemicals into the _ Releases of 400,000 pounds or more were reported by 125 plants, including 30 that reported 1 million pounds or more _ The most common chemical among the 13 examined was methylene chloride, used as a metal degreaser, paint remover and in aerosols It was cited at 18 of the 30 plants where releases exceeded 1 million pounds. The top polluter for each of the other 12 chemicals was: <ORGANIZATION> Borg-Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, acrylonitrile -LRB- 1.14 million pounds -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neches </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 1,3 butadiene -LRB- 960,000 pounds -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, Soda Spring, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, cadmium -LRB- 100,250 pounds -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Hercules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Parlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, carbon tetrachloride -LRB- 816,670 pounds -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Westvaco </ORGANIZATION>, Bleached Board Div., <LOCATION> Covington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, chloroform -LRB- 1.9 million pounds -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Castle </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayne </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, chromium -LRB- 94,000 pounds -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> PPG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Westlake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, ethylene dichloride -LRB- 820,000 pounds -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Geismar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, ethylene oxide -LRB- 594,000 pounds -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Aluminum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Riverdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, perchloroethylene -LRB- 2.3 million pounds -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, trichloroethylene -LRB- 2.3 million pounds -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Celanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resin </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Nueces </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, formaldehyde -LRB- 500,000 pounds -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Inland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, benzene -LRB- 2.2 million pounds -RRB-.

 Four <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> suburbs downstream from <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> want the government to cover the cost of testing their drinking water and stopping the flow of water from the weapons plant into their reservoirs. Officials from <LOCATION> Broomfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Northglenn </LOCATION> met on Monday with <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s top official at Rocky Flats, to press their concerns. The session was organized by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>. `` Local governments should n't suffer any additional costs from living downstream from Rocky Flats,'' said <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>, a Democrat. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> and his congressional colleagues have more say than he does over whether the suburbs get reimbursed. `` We can ask and we will ask, but it's up to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to appropriate the money in the end,'' he said. Fears over the safety of the water surfaced earlier this month with a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> probe of alleged dumping of hazardous wastes at Rocky Flats. Walnut and Woman creeks cross the site before entering the water supplies of more than a quarter-million residents.

 <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to spend $ 92 million over five years to curb toxic releases from a plant that has piled up $ 150,000 in pollution fines over the past year. The agreement, announced Monday, expands on a $ 15.2 million air pollution cleanup promised by the steelmaker in 1987. Officials said that the agreement, the largest ever negotiated by the state with an industrial polluter, is legally binding and that <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> could be fined more than $ 100,000 for failing to maintain the cleanup schedule. <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>'s Sparrows Point complex at <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> employs 8,000 workers and produces steel for ships, bridges, buildings, autos and appliances. The plant is the third-largest source of cancer-causing chemicals in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and one of the state's leading industrial sources of sulfur dioxide emissions, which have taken the principal blame for acid rain. Buoyed by its first profitable year since 1981, <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> pledged in 1987 to reduce emissions. The new agreement calls for more extensive measures, including a $ 40 million modernization of a chemical recovery plant to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and toxic pollutants, mainly benzene and hydrogen cyanide. Benzene can cause leukemia and other cancers, anemia and other health problems. Hydrogen cyanide can kill if inhaled in high concentrations. <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> also promised to repair leaking walls and flues at a cost of $ 24 million to cut down on the black smoke belching from three smokestacks. By 1994, the cleanup should result in reductions of 54 percent in particulates, 67 percent in sulfur dioxide, 50 percent in volatile organic compounds that create ozone, and 30 percent in benzene, officials said.

 A school that has straddled the <LOCATION> Indiana-Ohio </LOCATION> border for nearly 100 years, a center stripe in the gymnasium marking the state line, must continue to accept students from both states, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate said.

 Phone paging companies, their images bruised by drug dealers' incessant use of beepers, are bopping those beeped the most. <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it will join other companies in levying a surcharge on customers who use their beepers an inordinate number of times _ often a tipoff they're drug dealers. `` It's part of an industry-wide reaction to the perception that the paging industry is tainted by the fact that a few bad guys are using pagers,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernetti </PERSON>, spokesman for Telocator, a Washington-based trade association. Dealers went high-tech a few years ago to meet the high demand for crack, authorities said. Now the beleaguered beeper has become a symbol of drug dealing, a piece of electronic jewelry. When police make a bust, they often find guns, cash, drugs _ and beepers. `` The pager is nothing but a tool, the same tool that can reach a doctor and help save a person's life,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilcoyne </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>. The companies ca n't do much about those who buy or lease beepers, except make an identification and credit check. So they're hitting drug dealers at the other end _ the monthly bill, in the form of a surcharge. `` We feel it's had a positive effect,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Houpis </PERSON>, marketing director of <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which has charged $ 1 per beep over 1,000 a month since last fall. <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> said it will donate the surcharge to the <ORGANIZATION> Target </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a Missouri-based drug-counseling organization. The amount wo n't be known until later this year, <PERSON> Houpis </PERSON> said. Starting Aug. 1, <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> will charge 50 cents per beep over 500 a month and $ 1 for each over 1,000. AllCity Paging of <LOCATION> Tarzana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, also added a surcharge last year. Long Island Telephone may have started the trend. `` Way back in'87 our system was getting very crowded, we had very heavy usage _ drug dealers, naturally,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchiel </PERSON>, the company's sales coordinator, said Monday. The company charged 15 cents for each beep over 350 a month. `` It did lighten it up again, to where the other customers were n't getting busy signals,'' she said. Police say regular drug customers call the dealer's number and punch in their number. The dealer calls back and arrangements for a sale are made. Mrs. <PERSON> Marchiel </PERSON> said customers would `` come in with 25 pounds of gold jewelry, the stereotype. We ca n't accuse them of anything. We saw more and more, and their friends brought in friends.'' The company figures the surcharge eliminated about 35 percent of the `` problem users.'' Customers involved in law enforcement and public health and safety are exempted from the surcharge, she said. Will it hurt the dealers? `` It might hurt some of the lower-level dealers, but not the higher-ups,'' said a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> narcotics officer who spoke on the condition on anonymity. `` They just wo n't pay their bill, and get another beeper.'' Beepers have been banned in schools in several major cities, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, in an attempt to keep schoolchildren from being involved in drug sales. Rep. <PERSON> Kweisi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mfume </PERSON>, D-Md., has introduced the Beeper Abuse Prevention Act, which would restrict access to pagers to those under 21

 President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, faced with increasing civil violence, reimposed a nationwide state of emergency today less than six months after he had lifted it. Foreign and Deputy Defense Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> had proclaimed the state of emergency to try to control unrest that is believed caused by Sinhalese extremists. The emergency, which became effective immediately, is to last for one month and then be extended by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> every month. Emergency regulations give police and the military broad powers to arrest and hold suspects without warrants or other judicial requirements. Authorities also can dispose of bodies without inquests. Sinhalese extremists, mostly belonging to the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, are believed to have led a crippling 8-day-old strike by workers of the state-owned public transport company The strike by 20,000 workers of the <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has often turned violent and has forced more than 4,000 buses off the road. `` Public services, including transport, have been paralyzed by forcing the workers to keep away from work,'' <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said. Strike sponsors have threatened private bus and taxi drivers and last week set ablaze 15 buses, police said. Since it began an anti-government campaign in 1987, the Sinhalese front has been blamed for killing more than 3,500 people, most of whom were government officials or governing party activists. <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON>, without naming the extremists, said more than 1,700 people have been killed since January, of whom 965 were politicians, government officials and policemen. `` There has been progressive escalation of violence, acts of sabotage and disruption of essential services throughout the country,'' he said. `` Under such a situation, the government can not look on inactively.'' The Sinhalese militants launched their anti-government drive to protest peace overtures made to rebels of the Tamil community, who have been fighting for an independent nation since 1983. The insurrection forced <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, to declare a state of emergency in May 1983. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> lifted the emergency on Jan 11, nine days after he took office, in a bid to defuse ethnic tensions. He had pledged it would not be imposed again. The Tamil separatist campaign has claimed 9,000 lives. Tamils say they are discriminated against in jobs and education by the majority <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION>. Tamils, mostly Hindus, form 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people.

 A Soviet ocean liner with more than 950 people aboard rammed an iceberg in arctic seas and took on water today, but all passengers were evacuated. Some crew members stayed aboard to try to keep the ship afloat. A Norwegian coast guard vessel and helicopters rescued passengers from the 630-foot <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> and others who already had fled to lifeboats and ice floes. Most of the passengers are Western European vacationers. The cruise ship radioed northern <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s Rescue Coordination Center at 12:27 a.m. that it was listing after hitting an iceberg about 300 miles east of northern <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>, a coast guard spokesman said. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the accident occurred in fog. Norwegian and Soviet officials reported no injuries in the collision. <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said the coast guard vessel arrived at 4:15 a.m. and all passengers were rescued by about 7:30 a.m. Passengers said the evacuation was orderly. `` There was no panic at all,'' said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> passenger <PERSON> Winfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>. `` The Russian crew has worked perfectly in disembarking passengers into lifeboats, and also the Norwegians who picked us up ... have done a wonderful job, so nobody has been hurt or even worse,'' <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show in a radio-telephone interview from a rescue ship. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said the ship was apparently saved from sinking by new pumps brought by a Soviet tugboat and a Norwegian helicopter after others broke down. `` It looks like there is enough new pumping equipment aboard to keep it afloat,'' he said. The commander of the <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> boat Senja, <PERSON> Sigurd </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleiven </PERSON>, said 253 crewmen were being kept on board the Maxim Gorky. About 120 crewmen were rescued. The Senja reached the stricken ship early today and picked up hundreds of passengers who had jumped into lifeboats or scrambled onto ice floes in near-freezing temperatures and light rain, said <PERSON> Kjell </PERSON> <PERSON> Larssen </PERSON> of the north <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> Rescue Center at <LOCATION> Bodoe </LOCATION>. Others were rescued by helicopter from the ship or ice floes. Norwegian officials and the <ORGANIZATION> Lloyds </ORGANIZATION> insurance company of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said none of the passengers were missing or injured. The German travel agency <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flugreisen </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, which managed the cruise, said said 551 Germans and 16 other west Europeans were aboard and that a plane will be sent to pick them up. The Norwegian news agency said the passengers were from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Nekhoroshev </PERSON>, chief inspector for the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, as saying 575 tourists and 377 crew members were on board. The rescue center said it had received conflicting figures, but said there were 379 crew members. The liner was 185 miles west of the <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Spitsbergen </LOCATION> archipelago. Rescue efforts were aided by the 24-hour summer daylight of the Arctic. Several other Soviet and Norwegian boats were within 300 miles of the cruise liner. Norwegian helicopters ferried rescued passengers from the Senja's deck to <LOCATION> Longyearbyen </LOCATION>, the adminstrative center on <LOCATION> Svalbard </LOCATION> island, the largest in the <LOCATION> Spitsbergen </LOCATION> archipelago Airplanes were picking them up and taking them on to the Norwegian mainland. The liner had originated in <LOCATION> Bremerhaven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. It cruised to <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> and was to pass the <LOCATION> Spitsbergen </LOCATION> islands before making its way south along the Norwegian coast on its way home, the <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> said. The Maxim Gorky was built in 1969 and sold to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1974. In recent summers, it has carried mostly West Germans on tours from <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> arranged by German tour operator NUR. The ship was crippled a few hundred miles north of where a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear submarine caught fire and sank on April 7. More than 40 sailors died in that accident. There have been a series of recent accidents on Soviet cruise ships. In February 1986, the liner <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Lermontov </PERSON> sank off of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> after striking a reef. Of the 739 passengers and crew aboard, all but one crew member were rescued. In August of that year the cruise ship Admiral Nakhimov collided with a freighter in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and sank, killing several hundred Soviet tourists. A fire aboard the cruise ship Priamurye while it was docked in <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, in May 1988 claimed the lives of 11 Soviet tourists.

 Cities and states should look to tolls, fees and lotteries to finance roads and bridges because of the federal government's budget problems, <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told mayors today. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> that local governments can no longer count on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for most of its transportation investments. He said lotteries, toll roads and bridges, user fees and fees charged to developers are `` new, creative ways'' that state and local governments are turning to. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said federal transportation grants will increasingly be awarded to areas that offer to put up more local money than the 20 percent or 25 percent many federal programs require. `` If you do n't have 50 percent or better state and local participation ... that grant will be so far down the priority list it will not be reached,'' he said. On Monday, Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told the mayors he had taken partisanship out of funding decisions at his scandal-ridden department. `` Democrats and Republicans need to read my lips _ it's open to everybody on the basis of need as opposed to greed, as it existed in the past,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. `` I will clean it up. I will clean it out.'' The more than 200 mayors from both parties were continuing their five-day meeting today, with appearances by more <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials and Democratic National Chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. The conference concludes Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> also was scheduled to appear today. In prepared remarks, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> urged support for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clean air act proposal and said merely offering it was `` an act of great political courage. `` The president is walking head-on into one of our thorniest political briar patches,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal is aimed at breaking a decade-long congressional stalemate that has blocked enactment of tougher federal clean air laws. It calls for a 50 percent, 10 million ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions, a chief cause of acid rain, from coal burning power plants. Other measures are aimed at smog and ozone problems, including a phase-in of cars powered by methanol. The proposal marks a break from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which did not acknowledge acid rain as an environmental concern and opposed tougher laws to curb smog. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was greeted warmly, in contrast to an earlier appearance by <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s sharply partisan remarks, including his pledge to work actively for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> mayoral candidates and reference to the mayors as the `` farm team'' of the party, drew complaints from mayors in both parties. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> repeated his recent promise to crack down on mismanagement and fraud in the department and eliminate political influence from decision-making on federal grants. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has been beset by a series of scandals, including the embezzlement of millions of dollars and charges that well-connected Republicans used influence peddling to steer the awarding of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grants. He said reforms would not interfere with his goals, including establishing urban enterprise zones that are aimed at luring jobs to the ghettos, allowing public housing tenants to manage and purchase their residences, and fighting drugs. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> declined, however, to say whether former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who served throughout the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, must shoulder blame for the problems being uncovered. `` I'm not going to make a political judgment about any past secretary because I think it's unseemly of me,'' he said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he was `` confident I understand the scope'' of the scandals at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think it's as bad as the critics say. I do n't think it's as good as I want it to be,'' he said.

 Three Palestinians said they met a Jewish settler who was hiking in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, chatted with him, posed for a picture and then stabbed him to death, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said today. The men were arrested during the night by agents of the <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON> security service in the death Saturday of <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>, 48, of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement of Ariel, the officials said. They insisted on anonymity. Shortly after <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>'s funeral service in Ariel, a settler opened fire with an Uzi submachine gun on a group of Arabs waiting at major intersection near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, said police spokeswoman <PERSON> Dalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilad </PERSON>. Two Palestinians were wounded, one of them seriously, she said. The assailant was apprehended after being chased by police and residents. Police had no motive for the attack. The army blew up the homes of the suspects in <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>'s slaying, who are from the nearby village of <LOCATION> Burkin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said Their names were not released. Also today, <PERSON> Fahad </PERSON> <PERSON> Fawzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Madi </PERSON>, a 27-year-old Palestinian suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, was found beaten and stabbed to death in the town of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and Israeli news reports said. Another Palestinian, <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Antiz </PERSON>, 19, was found dead in his tent at the <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> detention center in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> desert, where he had been held without charge since February, an army spokesman said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Antiz </PERSON> apparently was killed by fellow prisoners who accused him of collaborating with the authorities. The army said police were investigating <PERSON> Madi </PERSON>'s death and checking reports on <PERSON> Antiz </PERSON>'s death. Also, a 34-year-old Palestinian postal worker from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION> was hospitalized with two broken legs and a broken arm after he was beaten by masked Arabs who suspected him of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. More than 50 Palestinians suspected of cooperating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities have been killed since the start of the 18-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule of the occupied lands. The deaths raised to at least 526 the number of Palestinians killed since the revolt began. Twenty-three Israelis also have died. The three Palestinians accused of slaying <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON> came upon the settler Saturday while he was hiking on a barren hillside near the Arab village of <LOCATION> Burkin </LOCATION>, about three miles from Ariel, the security officials said. They said the Arabs, who are from <LOCATION> Burkin </LOCATION>, told agents during interrogation that <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON> chatted with them, took their pictures with his camera, and asked them to take a photograph of him. One of them then grabbed <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>'s knife and stabbed him in the back, said the official. They said the three Arabs were taken to the scene today to re-enact the slaying. Other Palestinian shepherds found <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>'s body Sunday morning. An empty pistol holster, two spent cartridges, a map and binoculars were found near the body. There was no explanation of how the settler's gun might have been fired. According to Ariel settlers, <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON> was a nature lover and apparently was mapping a hiking route for residents when he was killed. <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>, who was raised in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, came to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1968 and had lived in Ariel for 18 months. He was not married. About 70,000 Jews live in 131 settlements in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, alongside 1.7 million Palestinians. Relations between the two groups have worsened since the start of the uprising. <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>'s death provoked public protests in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and calls from right-wing legislators for harsher measures to quell the Palestinian revolt. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> vowed Monday to `` uproot the violence with an iron fist.'' In other developments, troops used bulldozers to demolish two houses of Palestinians suspected of throwing firebombs at military patrols in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, military authorities fired the director of the Israeli-run <ORGANIZATION> Shifa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, accusing him of belonging to the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and of maintaining contacts with <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazgi </PERSON> denied the accusations, the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Yazgi </PERSON> was quoted as saying he believed his activities with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace activists had angered <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities.

 <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Loe </PERSON> watched his spearfishing partner shoot a 150-pound shark, and then felt the heavy jaws of a second shark clamp onto his leg. `` When I turned and looked, there was nothing but teeth embedded in my leg,'' the 45-year-old furniture retailer said Monday from <ORGANIZATION> Ochsner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION>, where he has been hospitalized since Saturday. <PERSON> Loe </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Slidell </LOCATION>, was more than 100 feet underwater in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and 40 miles off the coast at <LOCATION> Cocodrie </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, when the 6-foot shark attacked. <PERSON> Loe </PERSON> said he spotted a sand tiger shark and swam out of the way to let his partner, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Bukasky </PERSON>, get off a shot with his speargun. That shark fled, pulling <PERSON> Bukasky </PERSON> away, and then <PERSON> Loe </PERSON> was attacked by another 6-foot sand tiger.

 Hollywood hopefuls duped into sending photographs to a prison will get them back, along with a letter of apology from the inmate who conducted a movie-recruitment scheme from his cell, a prison investigator said. The scheme came to light two weeks ago when authorities in southwest <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> warned residents that telephone calls about a possible filming by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> were untrue. The calls were made by inmate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dury </PERSON>, a prison investigator at <ORGANIZATION> Staunton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in Staunton, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, 29, is serving nine years there for attempted larceny `` He admitted the whole thing,'' <PERSON> Dury </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Monday. `` I think it was kind of an ego-satisfying thing to have these beautiful young women sending photographs to him.'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> called high school students in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> about being in a movie, <PERSON> Dury </PERSON> said. Inmates routinely are allowed only collect phone calls; <PERSON> Dury </PERSON> declined to say how <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> bypassed the prison's phone system. The Hollywood hopefuls mailed photos of themselves to <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, who used several aliases, <PERSON> Dury </PERSON> said. A search of his cell last week recovered 15 or 20 photos from six or seven people. None of the subjects was nude. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> had tried, however, to obtain nude photos of students, <LOCATION> Mobile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> investigators said last week. <PERSON> Dury </PERSON> said there was no evidence that <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> was selling or trading the photos. He described the photos as portrait-type pictures from high school. `` One family did send photographs in bikinis. It appeared to be an older woman and two young girls,'' <PERSON> Dury </PERSON> said. No charges were immediately filed against <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dury </PERSON> said. Mobile County authorities asked federal officials to investigate, since the scheme crossed state lines.

<HEAD>Park Pulls Together a Fire Exhibit to Meet Public Interest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> has added an exhibit on the devastating fires of 1988, intended to help visitors drive through the park's charred areas _ as well as the unscarred half _ with more understanding. `` I hope people will learn enough to have a choice of what they think,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, a park naturalist. `` They still might be mad, but that's their choice.'' Knight directed planning and construction of the exhibit, which opened Saturday in the visitors center at <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>. The $ 136,000 production was an unusual crash program for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which usually requires at least two years of planning on a major exhibit, she said. The motivation was an unprecedented public interest, <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said. `` It was a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> of forest fires,'' she said. `` It was the first time fire was brought into people's living rooms on a steady basis.'' The exhibit, she said, shows the short-term effects of the fires, from five to 25 years from now, and explores the long-range future of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. The causes _ drought, lightning storms, the park's geography _ are explained, as well as recent history of fire supression that contributed to the build-up of fuel. The exhibit includes murals, portraits of firefighters, a video recouting the fury of the fires and presentations about animals. Grant Village survived a seige of fire in late July, although fast-running flames came within feet of staff dormitories. Now the area is an almost surreal scene: blackened trees interspersed with orange lodgepole pines that are dead but still have their needles. Except in the badly charred stands, there is a lush carpet of green grass growing through the soot and ash. And to the north and east, around <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, there is no evidence of the fires that swept through half the 2.2 million acre park. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, 44, typifies those who believe the fires were, in historical terms, good for the country's first national park, with long-term benefits for vegetation and wildlife. The exhibit does not, however, address the decision to allow many fires to burn naturally until late July, or refer to disputes between firefighters and park rangers that hampered some efforts to quell the flames until it was too late. `` We're not touching policy,'' said <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, who has been with the park service for 22 years. `` We're trying to get across that all of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> is not the same, that it wo n't recover the same.'' The exhibit she coordinated will take most visitors about 20 minutes to tour, although <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said there is enough information available for extremely interested tourists to spend more than two hours. Design costs ran $ 16,000 and production $ 120,000, <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said, not including the salaries and overtime required. The exhibit closes with writings by <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, a conservationist who remarked in 1927 that in fire-blackened forests, `` There were some scenes of desolation that pretty nearly drive an unimaginative person crazy.'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> concluded that `` an optimist could go surging through that blackened, misshapened world rejoicing because the forest will look just as beautiful as before _ in two or three centuries.'' Knight, like most other park employees, takes <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s view. `` It's always a changing park,'' she said. `` It was n't the same park in 1988 as it was in 1953 when I first saw it. `` The difference, obviously, is that this change is much more dramatic.''

 Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> met with President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> today during an official visit designed to strengthen ties between the nations. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, also acting commander-in-chief or the armed forces, is the highest-ranking official of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> to visit its northern neighbor since the 1979 Islamic revolution. He also is expected to seek military aid. He was greeted by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on his arrival today at the Grand Kremlin Palace and the two leaders promptly adjourned to the ornate crystal-lit St. <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>'s Hall for discussions, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. `` In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> there is confidence that the visit by <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> will give fresh impetus to the continued progress of Soviet-Iranian relations ... and will help improve mutual understanding and strengthen cooperation between the two countries,'' it said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was intent on developing strong relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` despite essential ideological differences between the two countries.'' Relations `` have grown especially strong lately,'' it said, crediting the late <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> for the improvement. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the fundamentalist leader of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic revolution, died on June 3. Before leaving <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> expressed hope that the visit, delayed since last fall, would open `` a new chapter in <LOCATION> Iranian-Soviet </LOCATION> relations and in the history of the region,'' said the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. On his return <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> is to stop in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> to complete 10-year cooperation agreements that include aid to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s growing arms industry <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> was accompanied by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, Commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Mohsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rezaie </PERSON>, Minister of Heavy Industries <PERSON> Behzad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabavi </PERSON>, representatives of seven other ministries and a number of parliamentary deputies, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Iravani </PERSON>, minister of economic and financial affairs, preceded him to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to complete the groundwork for signing a number of agreements, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> officially has a non-aligned foreign policy, but <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said soon after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> died that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader had told him to press ahead with improving ties with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. With ties to the West still strained, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is looking to the Soviet bloc for help in rebuilding <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> following its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Relations between the two countries soured soon after the Iranian revolution with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intervention in neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the 1981 Iranian repression of the Tudeh Communist party. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was one of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s major arms suppliers in the Iran-Iraq war that ended in a tentative truce in August. Iranian-Soviet relations improved with the Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In January, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> appealed to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to look to Islam for the solution to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s political and economic stagnation.

<HEAD>The Price of Pluralism: Cleaning Up From Campaign</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 With an exuberance matched only by the novelty of their new democratic parliamentary elections, Poles plastered campaign posters across the country over the last month. Now the time has come to pay the price of pluralism: cleaning up. With the signs of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s fledgling venture into free elections looking a bit tattered, the question remains: Who should scrub, scrape and wash away the campaign posters, and who should pay for it? An estimated 700,000 posters went up in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> alone in an astounding display of uncensored campaigning unseen in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> during 45 years of communist rule. That represented about 40 tons of paper, a significant amount in a country where university students sometimes do n't have anything suitable on which to type their theses. Most of the posters came from the independent Solidarity movement, which went on to win all but one of the 261 seats available to opposition candidates and hand the government a stinging rebuke in two rounds of voting that started June 4 and ended Sunday. Now, however, the posters such as those featuring gallant <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> in cowboy gear and a Solidarity button that says, `` High noon is June 4,'' are peeling off apartment block walls. Rain has smeared the sentiments of support for a communist coalition candidate whose banner hung along a main city thoroughfare. `` The emotions subsided, the litter remained ... Who is going to clean it up?'' asked the daily Solidarity newspaper. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Litynski </PERSON>, head of the Solidarity campaign in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, promised in the article that the union would work on the cleanup with city authorities. `` But we do not have the money to hire people. We have only debts,'' <PERSON> Litynski </PERSON> said. `` So those who were putting up the posters for free now will to clean them off, too.'' Another issue of the newspaper carried a call from 12-year-old <PERSON> Mikolaj </PERSON> <PERSON> Bober </PERSON>, who put up posters all over the Zoliborz section of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. `` We have to clean it up,'' he said. `` I am eager to do this ... and I count on the help of other boys and girls.'' The director of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> municipal cleaning enterprise, <PERSON> Leszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Swierczynski </PERSON>, said the city will clean the sites it administers, but building janitors, the bus and tramway services and others will have to take care of their areas. `` There is quite a lot to do ... and the whole -LRB- cleanup -RRB- campaign will surely take a lot of extra money,'' said <PERSON> Swierczynski </PERSON>, making it clear that the expenses of Western-style electioneering were not anticipated in his department's budget. `` The scale of the poster phenomenon in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> is extraordinary,'' he added.

<HEAD>Solstice Marks Longest Day of the Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wednesday is the summer solstice, the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. The solstice occurs at 5:53 a.m. EDT, according to astronomers at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Observatory here. The moment marks the time during the summer when the sun is farthest from the equator. The date, known in folklore as Midsummer, had been a time for parties and frivolity to celebrate the season. Listing the date as the start of summer has become a popular convention among calendar makers in recent years, but the designation carries no official weight. Meteorologists, for example, consider summer to have begun June 1.

<TEXT>
 Former Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was convicted of nine counts of perjury today for lying to a federal grand jury about a money-laundering scheme. The 38-year-old Republican, who served two terms in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s suburbs before being defeated in November, could receive up to five years in prison plus fines of $ 250,000 on each count at sentencing Aug. 25. The jury deliberated 17 hours over four days after nearly four weeks of testimony. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was indicted in October on 10 counts of perjury. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> dismissed one count during the trial. The former congressman was accused of lying to a grand jury in 1988 about his 1987 negotiations with an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agent posing as a drug-money launderer and with <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> associate <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>, later convicted of money laundering. Among other things, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was found guilty of perjury for denying that he had been told that the $ 850,000 he was seeking from the agent to finish building his luxurious home contained proceeds from drug trafficking. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> looked on impassively as the verdict was read, his wife's hand on his back. At a news conference, he said he was confident he would be vindicated on appeal _ `` not vindicated in the sense that I did no wrong, but vindicated in the sense that I never perjured myself before the grand jury.'' His chief attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who did not take the stand at trial, will appeal. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said, `` The jury has very obviously spoken today. ... -LRB- <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> -RRB- violated the integrity of the grand jury process.'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, a lanky, boyish lawyer, went to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 from the city's affluent eastern suburbs as a conservative, fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>. Under the cloud of the perjury indictment, he lost to Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a former TV actor from `` The Dukes of Hazzard.'' The jury heard secretly taped conversations with the undercover agent, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON>, in which <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was told that the $ 850,000 `` certainly'' included drug money and that he would be part of an operation to `` wash'' cash. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> proposed that a mortgage company be set up by <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> as a `` buffer'' to allow him to `` borrow'' the agent's money. In their last conversation, after <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> had received a $ 150,000 advance, he told <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON>, `` If <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> wants to launder y' all's money, fine But I ca n't do that. ... I can borrow the money from <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>.'' Later, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> told a federal grand jury he was `` never satisfied ... with respect to -LRB- the deal's -RRB- criminality'' and knew almost nothing about LeChasney's mortgage company. The deal never was completed. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was to have received $ 850,000 in exchange for a $ 1 million promissory note. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s lawyers insisted that he had been duped by a man he assumed was his friend _ LeChasney, whom they labeled a `` sociopathic liar'' and `` master manipulator'' who assured <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> that the deal was OK. <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> said the former congressman was guilty of `` stupidity'' but not perjury He said <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was fatigued at the time of his grand jury testimony and tried faithfully to recall details from months gone by. `` He never laundered a dime. He did the best he could when he got in front of the grand jury,'' <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> said. But Prosecutor <PERSON> Cragi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> scoffed at the `` I do n't remember'' and `` I do n't recall'' phrases that peppered <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s grand jury testimony. `` Do you think you would remember,'' <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> asked the jury, `` if you took a walk with a man you believed to be a criminal ... and he tells you narcotics dollars are involved ... what he does violates currency laws? `` Do you think you could ever forget?'' The prosecution called a surprise witness, money-laundering conspirator <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who testified that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> had told him last fall _ before the congressman was indicted _ how he planned to beat the perjury rap. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> recalled: `` He looked at me and said, ` <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, I'm a lawyer. In front of the grand jury, I used phrases like `` I do n't remember'' and `` I ca n't recall.'' They ca n't convict me for having a bad memory.''' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was a largely unknown lawyer and furniture store owner when he was elected in an upset in 1984, toppling veteran Democrat <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, a Presbyterian, took his campaign to evangelical churches, distributing a `` Biblical Scorecard'' in his race against <PERSON> Levitas </PERSON>, who is Jewish. In his two terms, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> staunchly voted with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> right and acquired a reputation as somewhat of a gadfly, voting against such popular programs as school lunch funding and aid to African famine victims. He filed a brief with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> advocating the teaching of `` creationism'' in schools. After his indictment, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> hoped to clear his name by Election Day with an immediate trial, but the effort collapsed after jurors received <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> campaign mail proclaiming his innocence. The judge aborted the trial. Two weeks later, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> won by 20 percentage points.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official media announced more arrests of demonstrators today and Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> said many more people must be rounded up and punished to prevent dissidents `` from making a comeback.'' New regulations went into effect today that appear designed to prevent people wanted by the government from fleeing the country. Officials in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> today announced that 18 Chinese refugees had arrived there by boat and asked for asylum because of the turmoil. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today issued orders to all lower courts to `` severely punish counterrevolutionary elements who have been charged.'' The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> radio station quoted the court as saying it was important that those who incited social unrest or participated in riots be dealt with swiftly. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has urged <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to grant clemency to 11 pro-democracy demonstrators sentenced to death and to pardon those who were arrested in protests. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> today declined to say what, if any, steps the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might take if <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> goes ahead with executions. More than 1,360 people have been reported arrested since demonstrations broke out in cities across <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to protest the army's killing of hundreds of unarmed civilians in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on June 4 in crushing the pro-democracy movement. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> advised that people who surrender or report the crimes of others be given lenient treatment. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, in remarks Monday, said `` counterrevolutionary unrest'' had been put down, but `` quite a lot of rioters are yet to be apprehended,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` We can in no way leave them unpunished and let them stage a comeback.'' <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> radio reported today that <ORGANIZATION> Liu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION> one of 21 student activists on a nationwide wanted list, was arrested Monday in <LOCATION> Baoding </LOCATION>, about 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Gang, 28, a physics student at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and one of the leaders of a now-banned independent student union, is the sixth to be arrested or surrender since the list was announced June 13. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported today that a student from the <ORGANIZATION> Zhejiang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION> had been arrested for spreading rumors to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government-funded <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper said <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiping </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> that the provincial government flew the Chinese flag at half-staff to mourn students killed in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> when troops drove them from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the country's symbolic seat of power. The <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> confirmed that <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> had called from the city near <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, but said it did not know whether its Chinese-language service out of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ran the item. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>, which enjoys a huge audience in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, has been accused by the government of `` rumor-mongering'' in its reports on the military crackdown. The <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> bureau chief was expelled from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last week. The government on Monday said it was expelling another foreign journalist for violating martial law regulations. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, an American working part-time for the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, was stopped by police last week after interviewing people in the countryside outside <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, an area not under martial law. He was given 72 hours to leave. In addition to <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> bureau chief, an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent and three British reporters have been ordered out in the past 10 days. The Canadian Embassy today requested a meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to protest an apparent attempt by plainclothes police to seize <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, correspondent for the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and Mail. There was no immediate response from the Chinese. Miss <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, a Chinese-Canadian, said she was walking home from the her embassy after interviewing Chinese waiting in line for visas when two men grabbed her and tried to force her into a car. She said she screamed and struggled and escaped when a crowd of pedestrians and bicyclists stopped to watch. A crew for the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television network was detained for 2 -LCB- hours this morning on troop-occupied Tiananmen Square. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said the crew was lectured before being released. The new foreign travel rules that took effect today invalidate all previously issued exit permits and require passport holders to obtain new ones before they can apply at foreign embassies for visas. Starting today, Chinese guards outside embassies began barring people without the new permits. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said only three Chinese showed up with the new permit and were able to apply for visas, down from 350 applications on Monday. Chinese news media, which last week showed hours of graphic tape of crowds attacking soldiers and burning military vehicles during the June 4 assault, emphasized today that the rebellion had been quashed and life was returning to normal. The national news showed farmers harvesting winter wheat and factories in full production. Foreign tourists and businessmen appeared on every news show as the government tried to emphasize that the political situation had stabilized and it was now safe for foreigners to return. Thousands of foreign business executives left the country after the military takeover of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and tourism, source of more than $ 2 billion in annual revenue, has dried up.

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s education commissioner today canceled statewide chemistry exams for 80,000 high school students after the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, citing widespread thefts of the test, published a stolen answer sheet. Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobol </PERSON> described the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s move as `` beneath contempt.'' Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' office said it was investigating the theft of two exams in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and looking into reports that copies of them were being sold for as much as $ 2,000 to groups of students who split the cost. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION> sponsors 17 exams on different subjects, which it distributed to high schools in padlocked safes for administering June 15-22. The exams are crucial for many students to graduate from high school without attending summer school and to get a diploma acceptable to colleges. The Post reported that so many stolen tests were circulating it took the newspaper just 15 minutes and two phone calls to obtain a copy of the chemistry answer sheet. The tabloid printed the 56 answers on its front page, explaining, `` The Post is publishing it only after learning that thousands of answer sheets have been photocopied by and distributed to high school students illegally.'' Post Editor <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nachman </PERSON> did not immediately return a telephone call today. <PERSON> Sobol </PERSON>'s spokeswoman, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, said a new chemistry exam will be offered Aug. 17 and the state also will grant students credit based on their high school chemistry grades. Other exams went on as scheduled this morning. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> estimated the cost of preparing and administering the new test at $ 250,000. She said <PERSON> Sobol </PERSON> canceled the exam after learning that the answers in the Post were quickly being `` faxed'' across the state.

<HEAD>Strategists See Child Care as Significant Issue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Child care will be a significant issue in the 1990 congressional campaign and Republican chances could be damaged if child care and parental-leave legislation is vetoed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic political strategists said Tuesday. <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Breglio </PERSON>, a Republican consultant who was pollster for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign in 1988 and is a former director of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign committee, said: `` I do n't believe serious political candidates in 1990 can avoid discussing the issue of child care. I do n't believe they can avoid discussing the issue of long-term health care.'' <PERSON> Breglio </PERSON> said he did not believe parental leave would be an issue because `` in terms of an issue you have to have clear-cut differences. It is very hard for me to imagine two candidates going at each other over the issue of parental leave.'' <PERSON> Celinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>, a Democratic consultant, argued that `` work and family issues,'' including child care, parental leave and long-term health care, `` have emerged as major policy issues in 1990.'' `` The president has vetoed the minimum wage,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> said. `` There is some possibility of a veto of parental leave and child care. If those three vetos come down, that is a definite statement of the Republicans' position on work and family issues, and it is up to the Democrats to take those voting records into the district and make those the issues that decide elections.'' The two consultants appeared on a panel sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>, the Great American Family Tour, and Lifetime television, which discussed results of a poll published by several magazines in February in which 74 percent of those responding said family issues should be a top priority for the president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Breglio </PERSON>, asked by a member of the audience about the effects of a series of presidential vetos, said, `` I think any time you are seen as a naysayer, that you have nothing positive to offer in the debate, you have a problem with voters of either gender.'' `` If programs have particular importance to women and you are vetoing a series of programs ... I think the cumulative effect of that could have more impact than, say, a single program and certainly that is one thing we would be watching,'' he said. <PERSON> Breglio </PERSON> said the most recent <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> poll indicates about 5 to 6 percent more support for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s child care program, based on a tax credit, than for a program being considered in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would involve direct government funding. `` So far, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is doing pretty well with women,'' he said. `` The numbers look very good. Now, if there is a whole series of vetos on legislation that is of particular importance to women, that could be a different ball game.''

Chinese dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, took refuge June 4 at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> shortly after the military crushed pro-democracy protests. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> has led Chinese intellectuals in calling for release of political prisoners and asserting that economic and scientific progress is impossible without protections for free thought. He was also angered the Chinese by saying Marxism is dead. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said Monday American workers are being advised strongly not to return to jobs in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We're not going to lift our travel advisory.

About 175 American companies have offices in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Many of them have received word from their Chinese partners in joint ventures reporting that the turmoil has subsided. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said that despite `` a pause in anti-U.S. propaganda over the weekend,'' the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> remains `` far from normal.''

<HEAD>Leaning Tower of Providence Immortalized on T-Shirts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The building that twice has defied explosions to fell it, now is being immortalized in three T-shirt designs and their creators are in a spat over whose brainstorm the shirt idea was. One depicts `` The Leaning Tower of <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>,'' another `` The Leaning Tower of <LOCATION> Bilray </LOCATION>,'' for the construction company that pulled the boo-boo, and `` The Hartford Park Horror Project,'' sponsored by Republicans who want to make political capital from the snafu. Bilray, contracted by the <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, tried twice on May 21 to implode the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> housing project and succeeded only in knocking out one floor, leaving the L-shaped building leaning on itself. The company has since been working at taking the building down with a traditional wrecking ball. State <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallante </PERSON> came out with the Republican T-shirt on Monday, but he says he had the idea all along but just got sidetracked about getting the shirts made up. The housing authority sold out its first 100 shirts Thursday and says it has 300 more going on sale Tuesday, with a price increase from $ 4 to $ 6. When <PERSON> Bilray </PERSON> groused they already had $ 9 shirts for sale, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON>, the authority's director, said he was the one who came up with the phrase `` Leaning Tower of Bilray'' the day the implosion failed. `` What does he want to do, sue us?'' <PERSON> O'Rourke </PERSON> said. `` I mean this is not one of those things that is high up on my agenda.'' <PERSON> Vallante </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> would offer to eventually add the total cost of the project to the back of its $ 5 shirts. `` The people of <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> have a right to know what is the cost in extra security, the costs for safety, the cost of the lost business in the area for this tower that is a testament to incompetence,'' <PERSON> Vallante </PERSON> said.

 The last thing <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> expected to be served for breakfast on his arctic cruise was vodka. <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> had gone to bed early Monday night, leaving his wife to enjoy a cabaret evening aboard the Soviet cruise liner Maxim Gorky. He ended up spending five hours in a lifeboat floating among icebergs. `` I was in bed when suddenly there was a terrible crash that almost shook me out of bed,'' said <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON>, one of more than 950 passengers and crew aboard the vessel when it struck an iceberg. Obeying instructions from the ship's loudspeakers, the 67-year-old West German pensioner with a walking disability pulled on his trousers, put on his life vest and went on deck to stand by a lifeboat. The liner, on a cruise out of <LOCATION> Bremerhaven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, struck the iceberg about 300 miles east of northern <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>. No injuries were reported. `` We are all safe and sound here,'' <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from a church on the Norwegian island of <LOCATION> Svalbard </LOCATION>, where passengers were taken by ship and helicopter after the accident. <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> said he had just heard that his wife was safe and coming to join him. They were being taken home to <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION> as soon as the rescue operation was complete, he said. He seemed in good spirits, joking: `` I'm standing here in my pajamas, and the trousers keep wanting to fall down to my knees.'' For a while, though, there was nothing to laugh about. `` When I got up on deck, I saw enormous ice blocks around. We were told to get into the lifeboats,'' he said, adding that there was no panic. `` We sat for five hours among the icebergs. The atmosphere was calm, and the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> sailors did everything they could. They gave us vodka and whiskey in the boats, since it was cold,'' said <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON>. `` And blankets too.'' Temperatures in the area were about 38 degrees. `` From the lifeboats, we could see that a third of the ship was under water,'' he said. <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> said that the ship appeared to be moving fast through the icy waters before the crash. There was a slight fog, but not enough to impair vision, he said. The Norwegian coast guard vessel <PERSON> Senja </PERSON> reached the stricken ship early Tuesday and picked up hundreds of passengers who had jumped into lifeboats or scrambled onto ice floes, said <PERSON> Kjell </PERSON> <PERSON> Larssen </PERSON> of the north <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> Rescue Center at <LOCATION> Bodoe </LOCATION>. Others were rescued by helicopter from the ship or ice floes. `` My wife will get here in a while,'' he said. `` They've gotten blankets and stuff together so that people can spend the night, I suppose.''

 A woman underwent back surgery on live TV and said she agreed to it in hopes of helping others who may need the operation. `` I do n't feel invaded at all,'' said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Arizin </PERSON>, 27, a sales representative from <LOCATION> Haddonfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who had suffered from back pain for more than half her life. The surgery took place on public television Monday night. The 2 -LCB- - hour operation to help correct a 50-degree curvature of Mrs. <PERSON> Arizin </PERSON>'s spine is expected to make the 5-foot-9-inch patient an inch and a half taller `` It's really kind of surprising, but the focus is the surgery and the new technique and how it can help other patients,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Arizin </PERSON> said. `` I agreed in the hope that it would help other people who are going through the same thing.'' <ORGANIZATION> WHYY </ORGANIZATION> said it broadcast the operation live for its impact and educational value. `` It's more exciting. It's more television, more immediate. It's just much more real We did it as an attempt to show people what it's really like, without editing,'' said station manager <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Othmer </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> WHYY </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> today said the station received at least 330 calls, its highest ever for one show. She said viewers called the program `` absolutely breathtaking'' and `` magnificent,'' but several found it gory. Ms. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said the show received a good 6.9 rating and an 11 percent share against the network lineup, which began at 8 p.m. with `` Kate & amp; <PERSON> Allie </PERSON>'' on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` ALF'' on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and `` MacGyver'' in <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. The rating is percentage of all homes with television, the share a percentage of televisions in use. Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothman </PERSON>, founder of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Rothman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> for orthopedic surgery, was host during the operation at the hospital. `` It was a tense evening because of the live television, but everything went extremely well,'' <PERSON> Rothman </PERSON> said. `` This is real life, that's what makes this operation so interesting. We do it every day, and even we are impressed.'' Viewers saw Mrs. <PERSON> Arizin </PERSON>, who was introduced in taped sequences, lying on her stomach on the operating table, surgical drapes covering her from the shoulders up and the hips down. Three cameras, including an overhead one, covered the 10-member medical team at work in the two-hour, 20-minute program. Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Balderston </PERSON> performed the operation, during which stainless steel rods were attached to the vertebrae to nearly straighten Mrs. <PERSON> Arizin </PERSON>'s spine. Bone was then grafted onto the rods to hold them in place. `` The surgery used to take six to seven hours. It now takes two to four hours,'' <PERSON> Balderston </PERSON> said. `` Patients used to be in bed for as long as six months. Now they're out of bed in one or two days. They used to be in a plaster body cast for as long as a year. Now it's very unusual to need a cast.'' Two percent of Americans suffer from curvature of the spine, or scoliosis.

<TEXT>
 A political crisis and new elections loomed Tuesday as conservative leader <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> was given three days to form a government but was rejected by a possible left-wing coalition partner. Both <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the communist-dominated leftist alliance, who together won nearly 60 percent of Sunday's vote, say a new government first must punish those responsible for the scandals of the defeated socialist administration of Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> But the alliance of the pro-Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which finished third, turned down <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>' offer to join in an interim government that would investigate the corruption The alliance also refuses to cooperate with <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, making the possibility of new elections likely and paralyzing <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which can not order an inquiry if the political parties can not form a government. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> can not keep making national decisions and demanded the replacement within 24 hours of officials appointed by <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, including the governors of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s 56 provinces, the heads of state organizations, including radio and television, and the secret service. `` I can assure you there will be catharsis,'' <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> told a news conference after President <PERSON> Christos </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartzetakis </PERSON> gave him the mandate to form a government. `` A solution has to be found as soon as possible, to allow parliament to investigate the scandals and to initiate prosecutions,'' he added. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>, who finished first with 44.29 percent of the vote and 144 of parliament's 300 seats, did not indicate how he might overcome the leftists' refusal to join him in a coalition. If <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> fails to form a government within three days, the president will ask <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and the leftist alliance in turn to try. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> clarified his coalition offer would only last a few months and would focus on investigating and prosecuting corruption. Following that, `` then we will go to new elections which will provide the political solution, which these elections did not,'' <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> added. Under the constitution, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> continues as caretaker premier until there is a new government, or new elections are held. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> said he told the president that <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> could not continue handling matters of national interest since the socialists were defeated. With 98 percent of the votes counted, the leftist-communist coalition has emerged as a kingmaker with 13.5 percent of the vote giving it 31 seats in the parliament. New Democracy won 44.29 percent, giving it 144 seats, seven short of a majority, and <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panehellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> 39.18 percent, giving it 125 seats. The communists said they are ready to cooperate with <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s party, but only if <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and all other party members they maintain are involved in the scandals are excluded <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and senior members of his party have been accused by the opposition of being involved in a multimillion-dollar scandal by fugitive banker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, the owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> is in prison in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> awaiting the hearing of an extradition demand by the Greek government. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> and the communist alliance maintain the election result was a clear mandate for an investigation of the scandals. But <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> said Tuesday that `` the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> people gave the majority to the democratic-progressive forces and excluded the return of the right and conservatism to power.'' `` These forces have the obligation to govern the state. This is the clear and indisputable mandate of the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> people,'' he added, in what was interpreted as yet another indirect appeal to the communist alliance to join forces with his party.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> on Tuesday endorsed the `` potential revolution'' under way in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but criticized President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for not taking a strong stand against suppression of reform in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, in a prepared statement to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, reigstered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for reform throughout the communist world. Whether in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> or in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, he said, reform `` is very much in our interests.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said no one could predict the outcome of the changes taking place in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and elsewhere. `` In the end,'' he said, `` we do know that the success of reform will depend primarily upon choices made in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, not <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>.'' He stressed, however, that political and economic reform were necessary in order for the East to progress. `` To stand in the way of such necessary, historic change _ as we are seeing to our outrage and sorrow in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ is to turn one's back to the future And that is why General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s temporizing comments on those tragic events are disappointing,'' he said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> apparently referred to a statement by the Soviet leader last week that he did not have `` sufficient information'' on events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to make a `` balanced and responsible judgment'' about <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s actions. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> appeared before the committee mostly to report on his meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last month with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and on the summit President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> at the end of the month with the leaders of the 15 other <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> nations.

In reviewing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee, he endorsed reform in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The Conciergerie, the dank and forbidding stone prison where victims of the French Revolution spent their final moments, opened to the public Tuesday in all its former gloom and grandeur. Queen <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON> occupied a cell on the ground floor for 10 weeks in 1793, hoping her supporters would come up with enough money to buy her freedom. She waited in vain, and went to her death at the guillotine on Oct. 16, 1793. The cell she shared with her jailer later was turned into a chapel as a shrine to her memory, but a replica of the cell has been recreated nearby and is decorated with wallpaper embossed with the royal blue and gold lily emblems that covered the walls 200 years ago. <PERSON> Maximilien </PERSON> <PERSON> Robespierre </PERSON>, who sent thousands of heads rolling during his 12-month Reign of Terror against counterrevolutionaries, spent his final hours a few cells away on July 28, 1794. `` His death warrant arrived about 10 a.m., and he was carted away to the guillotine in mid-afternoon,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Colardelle </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said during a tour of the restored landmark overlooking the Seine. The spot is marked by a simple black marble plaque. Admirers of <LOCATION> Robespierre </LOCATION>, known as the Incorruptible, say history has not done him justice. `` He has been made to bear all the guilt of the Terror,'' said former Health Minister <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartzenberg </PERSON>, one of several public figures eager to rehabilitate <PERSON> Robespierre </PERSON>'s memory. `` All revolutions are characterized by excess of some sort, otherwise they would not be revolutions,'' he said. No one, however, can accuse the French of not paying tribute to <LOCATION> Robespierre </LOCATION>'s victims and others who died during the turbulent events. A small room on the second floor is devoted entirely to their memory. Its four walls are covered with framed lists, in alphabetical order, of the 2,780 aristocrats, gardeners, shoemakers, doctors and clergymen found guilty by the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> and beheaded within three days. The verdict was either guilty or acquittal. There were no appeals. Some names are familiar, like <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Corday </PERSON>, who stabbed <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Marat </PERSON> in his bath. Others, like <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON>, gardener, are not. A short film with English subtitles helps visitors follow the events and depicts daily life at the prison. Ordinary prisoners shared the squalor of cold cells littered with filthy straw. The wealthy bought their way into cells furnished with beds and sometimes even desks, where many an aristocrat penned his memoirs. Also recreated are the quarters where the condemned were taken to have their shirts ripped wide and the napes of their necks shaved so the guillotine's blade would cut cleanly. Prisoners were allowed to circulate freely during the day in the women's courtyard. Despite their predicament, many privileged ladies managed to keep up with fashion trends, and even groomed themselves without the help of maids. `` <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON>, in her final days, even learned to put up her own hair,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalon </PERSON>, author of a recent biography. The $ 375,000 renovation of the Conciergerie is one of several refurbishing projects linked to bicentennial celebrations.

 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkin </PERSON> has produced hit albums for <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, Fine Young Cannibals and <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Watley </PERSON>, but the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> native has `` higher'' priorities. `` In the back of my mind, I always go for the single,'' said the producer of <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>'s `` Kiss,'' <PERSON> Watley </PERSON>'s `` Looking for a New Love'' and Fine Young Cannibals' `` She Drives Me Crazy,'' all No. 1 smashes. `` I go for the throat, really. I really am a singles-oriented person. It's really the way I want to go after it.'' Like a baseball manager who must cope with the personalities of different players, <PERSON> Rivkin </PERSON> _ known in the business as <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Z </PERSON> _ adjusts his style to fit the artist. With Prince, a gifted songwriter and arranger, the producer sees himself as a collaborator and occasional mind reader. `` He's a different personality every day, so you just have to capture whatever personality he is that day. I just think about how to frame whatever mindset he's in.'' With <PERSON> Tyka </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>'s introverted sister, <PERSON> Rivkin </PERSON> took a more delicate approach. He remembered the Jets' first album as his most difficult. `` It was the first real time we discovered a new artrist and we had to come through with all the songs and vocals. We were shooting in the dark, we were taking kids from a bar band and trying to make a national product,'' <PERSON> Rivkin </PERSON> said. `` We had to establish a direction. That was a bit difficult. We had to do every vocal; there was no sampling. Somes things you take for granted now.'' <PERSON> Rivkin </PERSON> was once a musician himself, playing guitar for <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> and writing with country-rock artist <PERSON> Gram </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>. He had lived in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in the early 1970s, but returned to his hometown in 1974. He was soon behind the control board. `` I did n't want to do it at the time, but I realized I had much more control over material sitting behind that seat. I gave up the idea of being a rock star.'' In 1980, he engineered <ORGANIZATION> Lipps </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 1 dance hit, `` Funkytown,'' and played guitar on their album. He has since produced a remarkable range of acts, from the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> funk of <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, to the blue-eyed soul of <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Oates </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boy </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, to the dance music of <PERSON> Watley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jermaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I try to fill the holes the artists ca n't fill,'' he said. `` That comes from doing the right sound, a special snare drum sound, a special vocal echo, and from making the artists feel good enough to bring out their personality.'' His sheer diversity has had drawbacks. In an industry that loves labels and openly categorizes music according to race, it's hard to define a white kid from the Midwest who produces best-selling dance records by black artists. `` I used to be classified as an R & amp; B producer. It was a hard notch to get out of. Because I was white, I would get a lot of flack. I've had a lot of No 1 black records. In the face of all that, my own inclination was to combine rock and R & amp; B.'' <PERSON> Rivkin </PERSON> compared himself to in a way to <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>, speaking of the cameo appearances that were the great film director's trademark A guitar riff is <PERSON> Rivkin </PERSON>'s subtle way of popping up in his work. `` I think if you look real hard, there's a thread running through all those records,'' he said. `` Rhythmically, there's a certain sound. `` In ` Kiss,' it's a major part of the record. Sometimes, it appears as a little wink.'' His presence is unmistakeable in the studio. Hit singles do n't come easy and <PERSON> Rivkin </PERSON> pushes hard for the best sound `` I make singers breath and emote a lot more than they would normally. I always look for that sexy breath. There's a fine line between getting it perfect and not losing the artist when you're doing it I do n't care if there's some rough edges,'' he said. `` Finding a producer is like finding a wife. It's tough. It's a chemistry thing. I like to get involved from the ground up. Usually, what I do is start programming drum parts at home on my machine. If you get a good drum and bass part, that's 90 percent of the pop record.''

 Republican National Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s highly partisan remarks to the nation's mayors have touched off criticism and dismay from elected city leaders of both parties. `` I was embarrassed and disappointed,'' said Republican Mayor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudnut </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, following <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s remarks to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. `` It was insulting to me and I think it was the most insensitive speech I've ever heard,'' said Democratic Mayor <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> used his appearance to declare the national <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would work actively for Republican mayoral candidates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and elsewhere, and would seek to recruit `` a half dozen to a dozen black mayoral candidates around this country to support actively.'' He drew a ripple of reaction from the more than 200 mayors when he said mayors would be an `` effective farm team'' for the Republicans who could later run for governor, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats. And attempting to show his commitment to recruiting blacks, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> singled out for introduction a black Republican mayor, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hempstead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, but mistakenly called him the mayor of <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> later called the slip insignificant and said, `` Chairman <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> knows my name and who I am.'' Today, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, a Democrat, told reporters that <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> mayors had told him they were embarrassed by <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s remarks targeting <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> for defeat. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> called <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> `` amoral'' and `` pathological'' for an innuendo-filled memo blasting House Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> denied having seen the memo before it was released, although an aide resigned over the controversy. Democratic National Chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, appearing before the mayors today, attacked the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman for pushing politics `` to its worst extremes.'' `` Thanks to the Lee Atwaters of the world, national politics is looking more and more like the coastline of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It was too patronizing,'' <PERSON> Hudnut </PERSON> said Monday about <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s remarks `` I did n't think it was appropriate to refer to us as a farm team for the major leagues,'' he added. `` I think a lot of mayors deal with tougher issues than <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> has been under fire for an innuendo-filled memo attacking <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, nd <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has called on <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> to resign. The president of the conference, Democratic Mayor <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, referred to <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> with a quip at a later session. `` I think <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> assumed that we had arranged a recruitment opportunity for him,'' he said. Even Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> made reference to <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s appearance and triggered applause when he told the mayors he was there representing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` not the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said he disliked the partisanship and <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s singling out of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> race, where Republicans hope to unseat Democrat <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. `` We need to hear what the Republican party intends to do about the issues facing the cities,'' <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said. `` We do n't want to know that he wants to defeat <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> had not yet arrived for the conference when <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> spoke. In his remarks, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said he was `` very excited'' about prospects in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and planned to put `` a substantial effort'' into that race. `` If we can establish a political beachhead in a city like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, that's going to be a political shot heard across this country,'' he said. New Orleans Mayor <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON>, a Democrat, pointed to <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s remarks that the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was interested in cities but would only put money in `` projects that work.'' <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> noted that the convention center where the meeting was held was financed in part with federal Urban Development Action Grants, a program the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration succeeded in killing. `` The very programs that help cities, they eliminated,'' <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said Tuesday it was ready to resume talks with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on easing tension, but it also denounced <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> for arresting a top dissident and called for his release. The communist nation delivered a letter at the <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> border truce site proposing the talks resume June 28. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> made a similar proposal May 26. South Korean officials, who released the letter, had no immediate response. The two nations have held talks at various levels since August 1988 on improving relations, but there has been no major progress. The latest talks are meant to set terms for the nations' legislatures to meet for formal negotiations on easing tension and reunification <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> suspended the talks in February after <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> refused to cancel annual military exercises held in March with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has been seeking the withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The letter, from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> delegation head Chon Gum Chol, charged <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> delayed talks further by arresting a South Korean dissident clergyman, the Rev. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ik-hwan </PERSON>, when he returned in April from a visit to <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> was charged with acting as a North Korean agent. `` We consider that your side should set free Rev. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ik-hwan </PERSON>, who was arrested unreasonably ... and show sincerity to take a step to create an atmosphere of dialogue,'' the letter said. Neither nation allows its citizens to visit the other side without permission. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s visit was part of efforts to cause political chaos. Separate government talks and negotiations between sports officials on forming a joint team for the 1990 Asian Games in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have been suspended until July. The two sides have not said if they will resume.

 Winemakers <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> today won exclusive rights to the family name, thwarting a younger brother who had put his name on a brand of cheese. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>'s use of his full name on cheese was calculated to mislead consumers into thinking the brand is connected with the E & amp; J Gallo Winery.

 <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that it will fund several projects to recycle some of the 16 billion disposable diapers used and discarded in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year. Plans call for the plastic in the diapers to be recycled into such things as flower pots, garabage bags and park benches, while the pulp will be used in cardboard boxes, building insulation and wallboard liner. Environmentalists warn that the plastic-coated disposable diapers, used by 85 percent of babies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, do n't decompose That, they say, could provide potential breeding grounds for dangerous viruses and bacteria that cause polio, hepatitis, meningitis and other diseases. `` We believe as a company it is our responsibility to ensure that our products are good not only for the baby but that they are good for the environment and can be easily recycled, composed and incinerated,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON>, P & amp; G's project coordinator. P & amp; G, the largest disposable diaper maker, sells $ 1.65 billion worth of Pampers and Luvs annually. Company officials, speaking at a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said P & amp; G would spend an undetermined amount of money over the next five years on recycling projects in the states of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The project includes an effort with the <ORGANIZATION> Solid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rabanco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, which will collect used diapers from 1,000 volunteer households. The diapers will be washed and sanitized before being separated into plastic and pulp. P & amp; G also will provide money and soiled diapers to <ORGANIZATION> Recomp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a St. Cloud, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, recycling company that turns much of that city's garbage into a composted soil used in landscaping and to reclaim salt-tainted highway strips St. Cloud already recycles diapers, but <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G will import additional dirty diapers from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>. Diapers, which make up an estimated 1 percent to 2 percent of the nation's garbage heap, are not the largest landfill problem. But items such as paper, bottles and cans, unlike diapers, can be recycled. <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> lawmakers have banned the sale of non-biodegradable diapers by 1993. The legislation notes both the environmental threat and the fact that biodegradable diapers use a plastic made from corn, a crop grown in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. Legislators in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> have considered similar action. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolosi </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G's paper products division, said the announcement was not motivated by market or legislative pressures. `` I do n't think that any one announcement is going to stop the concern within state legislatures,'' he said. `` What I hope it will do is focus attention on viable solutions.'' <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehrburger </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, recycling expert who has studied disposable diapers for the cloth-diaper industry, asked if the recycling of plastic and paper would be economically feasible. `` I applaud their efforts in seeking alternatives to the environmentally harmful disposal of their product,'' he said, but added that the company seemed determined to maintain its product rather than changing to a more ecologically sound diaper.

 A Democratic member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday urged <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> to suspend production of the B-2 stealth bomber because the aircraft has yet to undergo flight testing. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> in response reaffirmed his support for the B-2, which at $ 500 million a copy is the most expensive plane in history. The bomber is a necessary component of the triad of air -, land - and sea-based nuclear weapons, said <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>'s Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, a former astronaut and test pilot, argued that pursuing production of the radar-evading plane violates the rule of `` fly before buy.'' The bomber program has been `` buy it, and then we'll see how it flies,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said in a letter to <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>. `` The B-2 is a total departure from our usual new aircraft,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said. said. `` It is a flying wing. There are new control concepts, different center of gravity considerations, and new aerodynamics just to name a few. Going ahead with additional production before flight tests have even started just does n't make sense.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has proposed pushing back production of the stealth bomber a year to 1993 and cutting almost $ 4.1 billion from fiscal 1990 and 1991 budgets for the plane. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said $ 22.4 billion has already been invested in the stealth program, and concluded that it would be `` totally irresponsible'' to continue production without flight test results. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> argued that the money earmarked for the stealth bomber could be used for `` high-priority conventional programs that have been terminated or deferred.'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>, said he favors the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' V-22 Osprey, a battlefield aircraft designed to take off like a helicopter and fly like an airplane. The Pentagon had hoped to spend $ 25.9 billion on 663 Ospreys, including $ 1.3 billion in 1990, but <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> decided to terminate the program. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> is `` a big believer in the triad, and he thinks the B-2's long-range capabilities and its stealth capacities make it an important strategic asset to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> `` So, he plans to continue right on with that and he reaffirmed his strong support for the B-2 program.''

I ca n't hear you,'' the star of `` Body Heat'' and `` The Big Chill'' said as <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> pressed him about his feelings for former lover <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> after the birth of their son, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, a 32-year-old former ballerina, is pursuing a multimillion-dollar divorce claim against Hurt, contending they had `` a spiritual marriage'' more sacrosanct than a legal union. <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> today became frustrated during cross-examination of Hurt by constant objections from the defense. He complained to the judge that the objections were `` interrupting my rhythm, and rhythm is everything.'' As <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> sought to resume questioning, Hurt _ who had been snappish, combative and evasive in a day and a half of testimony _ said to <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>, `` Get your rhythm right.'' <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> replied: `` You got your rhythm right when you made <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>, did n't you?'' Hurt turned to Justice <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Silbermann </PERSON> and said, `` You can permit that?'' She told <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> to confine himself to the issues. When <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> resumed questioning, <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> said he was could n't hear the questions. He leveled his finger at <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> and accused him of making `` a perverse and insulting remark about my son.'' The judge declared a recess. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> is seeking half the money Hurt has made since Dec. 9, 1982, when he learned his divorce from his first wife, actress <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>, was final. <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> put Hurt's worth at about $ 10 million. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> claims a common-law marriage exists because she and <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> lived together from 1981 to 1984. `` He told me we were married in the eyes of God,'' she said during a courtroom break Monday. Hurt, 39, said he told <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> after they started living together that he was put off marriage by `` the pain of it not working out with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON>.'' In March, Hurt married <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, daughter of bandleader <PERSON> Skitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>. Hurt, who won a best-actor Oscar for `` Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' also has starred in `` Broadcast News,'' `` Gorky Park,'' `` The Accidental Tourist'' and `` Children of a Lesser God.''

 Dieters who lose 10 or 20 pounds may give away their baggy old clothes. But <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Genz </PERSON>'s 173-pound loss left him with too much skin, so he donated about 4 square feet to help save burn victims. `` This is a first for us. ... Occasionally, rarely, if a child is a patient a parent may donate skin,'' <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Perls </PERSON>, director of education for the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. The 5-foot-11 Genz, 43, weighed 430 pounds last August when he began a high-protein weight-loss regimen. Last week, he weighed in at 260 and prepared for surgery to remove excess skin from his abdomen to ease back pains and other problems. `` I was sitting at lunch with some nurses and we were joking that it was too bad I could n't donate the skin,'' said <PERSON> Genz </PERSON>, equipment coordinator for the emergency department at <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Elgin </LOCATION>, just northwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Then one of the nurses said, ` Why not?''' he recalled Tuesday from his hospital bed, where he was recovering from Monday's surgery. The decision `` left me with a good feeling,'' <PERSON> Genz </PERSON> said, adding that he felt fine but had `` kind of a big scar.'' `` I've worked in emergency rooms for 25 years. ... I'm a strong supporter of transplants,'' he said. What if he gains back the lost weight? `` The skin would just stretch out again _ but I do n't intend to gain the weight back,'' <PERSON> Genz </PERSON> said. The operation removed 19 -LCB- pounds of skin and adjoining tissue, <PERSON> Genz </PERSON> said. His donated skin _ about four square feet _ will be used to care for burn patients at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` More lives are saved by skin transplants than any other donated organ,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON>, professor of surgery and director of the university's burn unit. `` What kills burn patients is loss of fluid and infection,'' Ms. <PERSON> Perls </PERSON> said. Donated skin `` is used as a kind of living bandage'' while the patient regenerates his own skin, she said. Then the borrowed tissue sloughs off. Because its use is temporary, skin used for burn patients need not be a perfect tissue type match like that used for skin grafts or other organ transplants, Ms. <PERSON> Perls </PERSON> said. She noted that noting most such tissue is removed from cadavers. But while <PERSON> Getz </PERSON>'s contribution is unusual, `` this kind of weight loss is unusual, too,'' she said. `` Anything that will make people think about organ or tissue donation is good,'' she said. University hospital spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> agreed. `` There's a shortage of any sort of donated organ. ... It is beneficial and it comes at a good time _ I think they're planning to use some of it today,'' <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Genz </PERSON>'s contribution. `` I think any sort of organ donation ... is a valuable, life-saving procedure.''

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Argyropoulos </PERSON> talked to a machine Tuesday and the machine talked back, telling the 22-year-old engineering student the time, reading newspaper articles aloud and dialing a phone number. Its developers say the machine, though still primitive, is the most promising aid for the blind since the introduction of Braille 160 years ago. The Personal Companion, unveiled at a news conference, was created for the 6.5 million Americans who can not see well enough to read or are so handicapped they ca n't turn a page or punch a keyboard. The machine has the appearance of a computer, but without a keyboard. It is programmed to respond to the voice of its user. <ORGANIZATION> Transceptor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Ann </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, company founded in 1986 by people with backgrounds in medicine, visual rehabilitation, telecommunications, computer design and education, developed the Personal Companion. <PERSON> Argyropoulos </PERSON>, a 22-year-old computer buff, designed the softwear, working 20 hours to 80 hours a week while a student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>. He said he wanted to build a machine `` not for the superstar blind person but one that your grandmother could use without knowing anything about computers.'' <PERSON> Argyropoulos </PERSON> said 20 minutes of training by the machine, which gives instructions by voice, are all that's needed to get started. Company president <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrory </PERSON> said the machine costs $ 6,500 to $ 6,800. The higher priced model comes with a screen for the visually impaired on which the type can be made several inches high. <PERSON> McCrory </PERSON> said the machine could be leased by those who ca n't afford to buy one <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for the Blind and a consultant to the company, called the development `` analogous to the introduction of Braille'' by blind Frenchman <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Braille </PERSON> in 1829. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who is legally blind, compared its potential impact to the introduction of curb cuts that enable people in wheelchairs to use sidewalks. In the voice demonstration, <PERSON> Argyropoulos </PERSON> had the machine do mathematical computations, record a checkbook transaction _ but not actually write the check _ tell what was in his appointment ledger and turn on the radio and the lights. At his command, the device called information to get and record a phone number and then dialed the number. By arrangement with the <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a condensed version of <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> Today is made available each day over a telephone line. The machine's synthetic, mechanical sounding voice lists the sections of the newspaper, recites the headlines and reads abbreviated versions of stories selected by the user. Ultimately, <PERSON> McCrory </PERSON> said, far more information will be available from computer data banks and the machine will play compact discs, each capable of reading aloud up to 50 books. Company founder <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumenkranz </PERSON>, an ophthalmologist and surgeon at the <ORGANIZATION> Kresge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, said an engineer who lost his sight in a hunting accident five years ago consequently lost his business. The engineer has been testing the machine and `` feels he will be able to go back into business for himself,'' <PERSON> Blumenkranz </PERSON> said.

 New controls on Chinese travel abroad took effect Tuesday, causing the number of applicants for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visas to plummet. Dozens of Chinese had camped outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian embassies in hopes of getting their visa applications in before the new rules took effect. Among them were doctors, computer scientists and economists, some of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s best-educated and brightest citizens, all hoping to study or do research abroad. `` We did n't dare leave to eat or sleep for fear of losing our place in line,'' said an economist who succeeded in applying at the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and was waiting outside for a response. The revised visa requirements appeared designed to screen depatures more carefully and prevent fugitive dissidents from getting out. They came two weeks after the army rolled into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and opened fired on students and supporters demanding a freer society. There was much confusion about the new regulations. Under existing procedure, Chinese are required to obtain exit permits from their local police stations before Chinese guards outside foreign embassies allow them to enter to apply for visas. According to reports in the official media over the weekend, the new rules invalidate all permits issued before Tuesday. Through Monday, Chinese could still use the old permits to enter embassy grounds, but as of Tuesday the old permits were not good for even that. One radio report and a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> source said visa applicants now must also get a second permit after obtaining the visa. Many Chinese applicants and several Western consular officials said they did not know about this requirement and it could not immediately be confirmed. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said only three Chinese showed up at the consulate Tuesday with the new permit and were allowed by Chinese guards to apply for visas. By comparison, 350 people applied on Monday, about average for summertime, he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> are two of the most popular destinations for Chinese traveling abroad for business or study. A third popular country, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, has not reopened its consular section since closing it after the military crackdown began on June 3. Most of those waiting outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian embassies on Tuesday made plans to go abroad before the crackdown and were not involved in the protests. But they said they feared police would be stingy about issuing exit permits in the new conservative political climate. `` I have n't been in trouble but -LRB- <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials -RRB- may be worried about ` spiritual pollution,''' said a doctor waiting for a response to his wife's application to study in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Chinese officials refer to unwanted Western cultural influences and values as spiritual pollution.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is seeking to take advantage of new openness in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> as he forges a Soviet policy designed to meld <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> into the international community. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is on the move now, unveiling new arms negotiating tactics as well as plans to relax financial strictures on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as that Soviet-bloc nation moves toward democracy. But four months of silence at the beginning of the administration, while the president and his aides conducted a `` strategic review,'' left the impression that the new team was uncertain how to deal with a volcano of Soviet reform. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwill </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff member for Soviet and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> affairs, and other <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides are seeking to counter that impression. `` We know where we want to go,'' <PERSON> Blackwill </PERSON> said. `` We know of the enormous opportunities that are out there. And we also understand that if one makes a mistake in an era of transition, that there is no inevitability for stability in international order, and it could have a very high price.'' `` We are trying to create the structure of a relationship that makes it less likely it can be reversed, less likely that we can have a return to the sort of conflict we saw in the 1970s and 80s. And finally, to integrate the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into the international system so that it uses its enormous power to solve international problems rather than to exploit them,'' <PERSON> Blackwill </PERSON> said in a speech Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, during a summit of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> three weeks ago, outlined a plan to rapidly reduce superpower conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, surpassing even the proposals of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Some of the fine print of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Soviet-bloc plans, outlined in broad terms over the past two months, has been disclosed recently concerning arms negotiating tactics and help for the Polish economy. Within a few days, said <PERSON> Blackwill </PERSON>, the administration will divulge specifics of new proposals in the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reduction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Talks </ORGANIZATION> to test _ with the Soviets _ means of verifying the reduction or elimination of long-range nuclear weapons. The ideas take advantage of apparent new Soviet openness to verification and are designed to avoid the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> misgivings that helped block ratification of the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> in 1979 and held up the Intermediate-range Nuclear Force Treaty last year, said <PERSON> Blackwill </PERSON>. `` The purpose of the confidence-building and verification measures which ... are being conveyed to the Soviets are to accelerate, not delay, a historic agreement,'' said <PERSON> Blackwill </PERSON>, declining to specify whether the proposals envision on-site inspections or satellite surveillance. More details of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s policy toward <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are expected early next month when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> travels to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, two Soviet bloc nations that <PERSON> Blackwill </PERSON> said are pushing away `` the dead hand of communism'' with their political and economic reforms. `` Some believe that in trying to conceptualize a Soviet-American relationship through the end of the century, taking four months to do that, is a long time. I do n't how long they take to buy a house,'' <PERSON> Blackwill </PERSON> said. `` We have to keep remembering that dealing with an autocratic system as exists in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, that reversibility is possible. We have just seen tragic evidence of that fact in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Blackwill </PERSON>, referring to the suppression of the pro-democracy movement in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, in which thousands reportedly died. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his top aides have lived most of their adult lives during the Cold War. <PERSON> Blackwill </PERSON> and his boss, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION>, also served in the White House during detente, under Presidents <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, when many proclaimed the end to the Cold War. And so they dilute their hope with caution. `` I wrote myself the toast that President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> gave in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> indicating that detente was irreversible'' in the early 1970's, said <PERSON> Blackwill </PERSON>. `` It turned out that that was n't so.'' `` The danger still exists. ... The Cold War began in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and it must end there,'' he said, adding that Soviet military intervention in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> now `` would set back normalization of East-West relations through the end of the century.'' `` It is somewhat difficult for me to imagine that the Cold War is over when today, there are 580,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` After Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s unilateral reductions, which we welcome, which were announced at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> last December, there will still be 550,000 men of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. We have a ways to go before the Cold War is over in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.''

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s treasurer announced his retirement today, averting an impeachment trial on charges he bungled an investment fund.

The flamboyant Democrat turned 62, making him eligible for an immediate pension, after he was impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in March on 17 counts blaming him for an estimated $ 279 million loss from an investment fund. Lawmakers charged that <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> did n't know about the losses and should have, or knew of the losses for more than a year and hid them from the public.

 They were in hog heaven over at the World Pork Expo. There was everything a porker could produce: pork rinds, pork chops and just plain pork.

 <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasparro </PERSON>'s artwork is worth a fortune, but people drop it on the ground every day one cent at a time and few bother to pick it up. For sentimental reasons, <PERSON> Gasparro </PERSON> usually fetches pennies from the sidewalk. <PERSON> Gasparro </PERSON> designed the tails side of the penny that replaced the wheat-back penny 30 years ago. His initials can be found just to the right of the Lincoln Memorial's base. Occassionally when he gets a penny in change, he'll point out his work to the cashier. `` They think I'm goofy,'' the former chief engraver of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said. `` I'll say, ` I designed it, you can see my initials if you've got good eyesight.''' As the man who designed the <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> dollar, he is the only living person to have sculpted the front and back of a general-circulation <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coin. He also designed the back of the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> half dollar. <PERSON> Gasparro </PERSON>, who asked a reporter not to write his age, said he is dissappointed the <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> dollar was n't more popular. He figures people just could n't get used to a dollar that does n't fold. But the back of the penny, which he designed in 1958 and was first issued in 1959 to mark the 150th anniversary of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s birth, is the most circulated of his work When he presented his design to his superiors, they told him to remove the words `` Lincoln Memorial'' from below the relief of the building and 13 stars that ran around the outer edge of the coin. <PERSON> Gasparro </PERSON> agreed, but refused to take out his initials and the tiny statue of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> between the sixth and seventh columns, two features his boss said would look like smudges of dirt. `` If you do that, it would look like a library,'' he recalled saying at the time. After 38 years at the mint, <PERSON> Gasparro </PERSON> retired in 1981 and has been sculpting about 15 to 20 commemorative coins a year for private groups.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, in a rare moment of candor about his personal life, said Tuesday he was so determined to come to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1935 that he lied to get around British restrictions. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> applied and was accepted at the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> that year even though he had no plans to study. The acceptance paved the way for an entry permit from the British. `` I decided that this was the only way,'' he said. The Polish-born <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who was leader of a militant Jewish underground and later a senior officer in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mossad </LOCATION> intelligence service, usually is tight-lipped about his personal life. He was speaking to about 600 Israelis who were among 2,000 Jews saved from the Nazi Holocaust with the help of acceptance certificates from the university between 1932 and 1941. Many applicants used the certificates to get around immigration restrictions, said university spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrach </PERSON>. The university was trying to save as many people as possible, but had to limit the number of certificates because it was being closely watched by the British, <PERSON> Barrach </PERSON> said. In his 1935 application, the 20-year-old <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> wrote he had studied law for a year at <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to please his parents, but that Hebrew literature was his true love. `` After some months of study, it became clear to me that the only place where I could fully realize my desires and exercise my abilities would be the Institute for Jewish Studies at the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>,'' wrote <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, then known as <PERSON> Icko </PERSON> <PERSON> Yezernicki </PERSON>. He also wrote that his family was well-off and would support him. The letter `` was n't too accurate a description of my feelings,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> conceded Tuesday. `` I had to put my family into debt to be able to immigrate.'' He said he spent some of his first days in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> wandering around campus and sitting in the library. `` I wanted to study, also Hebrew literature, but I could n't because I had nothing to live on,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told reporters, adding with a smile: `` In the meantime, I got involved in other things. They included joining <ORGANIZATION> Irgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zvi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leumi </ORGANIZATION>, a militant Jewish underground group that fought British mandatory rule in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. In 1940, he became a founder and leader of the `` Stern Gang'' which carried out a campaign of political assassinations and bombings of British installations. In 1948, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ended the British mandate and established the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Asked whether he was sorry he did n't complete his studies, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said: `` Not at all. I do n't regret anything I did.''

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will test for radiation contamination from a one-megaton nuclear bomb that fell into its waters from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft carrier 24 years ago, officials said Tuesday. Even if radioactivity is found, however, `` it will be very hard to distinguish'' whether it came from the lost bomb or from nuclear tests, said <PERSON> Michiaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Okubo </PERSON> of the Science and <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> did not learn until last month that an A-4 Skyhawk plane carrying a hydrogen bomb rolled off the carrier <LOCATION> Ticonderoga </LOCATION> on Dec. 5, 1965, about 80 miles from a small island near <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The bomb and plane settled in the sea bed after its radioactive material dissolved into the sea water, according to an official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> report released by the Japanese government last month. Researchers will take water samples from eight locations and results may be announced by September, <PERSON> Okubo </PERSON> said. `` We will check water samples to learn about the environmental effects on fish,'' he said. <PERSON> Okubo </PERSON> said no samples of earth will be taken from the sea bed where the bomb sank because scientists have no samples for comparison. Fish samples from the site already have been sent for analysis at a government research institute by a local government in southwestern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, news reports said. Results should be known by mid-July. Last month, nuclear specialist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON> of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, which released a declassified <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> document on the accident, said there is little danger the bomb could detonate. But the 33 pounds of radioactive plutonium in the bomb could threaten the environment as it deteriorates, he said. Opposition parties and some citizens groups charge <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships routinely visit Japanese ports carrying nuclear bombs in violation of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s non-nuclear policies.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has acquired 25,000 acres of land in southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for a refuge to protect the state's threatened panthers, the department said Tuesday. The land east of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> and adjacent to the Big Cypress National Preserve will be the location of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> to be managed by <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>'s Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The land was purchased for $ 10 million. An additional 5,000 acres will be part of the refuge as a result of land exchange. `` The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panther is one of our country's most endangered species. It is a symbol of the wilderness amidst the booming development of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panther is among the most critically endangered mammals in the country, with only an estimated 30 to 50 animals remaining. The new refuge also will provide habitat for a half dozen other endangered or threatened species including the wood stork, snail kite, bald eagle, red-cockaded woodpecker, peregrine falcon and Eastern indigo snake, officials said.

 Police confirmed that a convicted rapist now in custody in two attacks is a suspect in at least some the slayings of 19 young women, most of them crack addicts who exchanged sex for drug money. But no new charges have been filed against <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and investigators may never have enough evidence, said Metro-Dade Homicide Cmdr. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>. `` We've exhausted all leads,'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said Monday. `` It's not like anyone has left a calling card or footprint or anything like that.'' All but one of the women were found dead in a low-income area of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> starting in September 1986. Most showed signs of recently having had sex, and initially appeared to have little or no evidence of trauma on their bodies. Almost all had traces of cocaine in their blood and were known for prostitution, police reports said. Police are investigating a second suspect in one of the killings, which occurred while <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was in jail, and are looking at a third man as well, but not as seriously, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who served time for rape in the past and is in jail facing two additional charges, has denied any involvement in the killings. But <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, noting he could only speak for the 11 <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> cases, said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> `` is a main suspect in some of them.'' Eleven of the killings occurred in <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION>'s juristiction, seven in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Hialeah </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has been linked with four of the dead women, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said. `` He knew them, or he dated them or he did drugs with them,'' he said. In addition, relatives and friends of one of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> victims have said she knew <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Since <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was arrested in early April on the rape charges, no women have been found dead in the same manner. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> said his department's detectives have little to say about the case. `` Our investigators are cooperating with the county in investigating <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' alleged connections with any of the deaths,'' <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> said Tuesday.

 A tearful state Treasurer <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> on Tuesday announced his retirement, effective the day before the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was to consider removing him from office. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>'s decision saves his $ 2,000-a-month pension, which he could have lost had he been ousted from office for his role in the loss of $ 279 million from an investment fund his office supervised. `` I can not in good conscience ask the people of this state to endure the financial and emotional expenses that would accompany a lengthy political trial _ and that's what it would be, a political trial,'' <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, 62, said during a West Virginia Day celebration marking the state's 126th birthday. State Del. <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, one of the five <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> members who would have helped present the case against <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, said he had mixed feelings. `` I think it may have done the state some good to kind of have a trial in the case because it would have shown the citizens just exactly what went on in the treasurer's office and hopefully prevent it from ever happening again,'' <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said. `` On the other hand, I'm certainly glad we do n't have to expend the state's money to put on this trial.'' He said the trial would have lasted a month and cost $ 750,000. Another member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> team, Del. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, said a trial would have given the state bad publicity. `` I'm certainly relieved for his benefit as well as the state's,'' <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> said. `` I think as things stood this morning, it was the honorable thing to do. He should have done it a while back.'' <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> said he will concentrate on supporting the Special Olympics, the <ORGANIZATION> Spinal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Injury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> houses. `` The time for my departure is at hand,'' <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> said, reading from his letter to Gov. <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> announcing his retirement, effective July 9. `` I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith.'' <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> will appoint a temporary successor to <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, and voters in the 1990 general election will select someone to fill the remaining two years of <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>'s term, Secretary of State <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Hechler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> served in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION>, as secretary of state and was elected state treasurer twice.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Allow Marijuana Use by Jamaica-Based Coptic Church</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court Tuesday rejected a claim for a religious exemption to drug laws that would have allowed the use of marijuana in rites of the Jamaica-based Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> said in a 2-1 decision that the `` First Amendment's free exercise of religious guarantee does not require the requested exemption.'' The court found that <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>, a self-described priest in the church who was once convicted of importing 20 tons of marijuana `` was not denied equal protection-establishment clause rights by the government's refusal to accommodate his church's sacramental use of marijuna.'' The panel upheld a decision of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to deny the exemption. It noted that <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> had once been convicted of importing 20 tons of marijuana, which <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> had called `` an outragous quantity to supply -LRB- his church's -RRB- religious needs.'' According to the court, the religion has up to 2,000 adherents in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and no more than 200 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The court, in an opinion by Circuit Judge <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, said that granting <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> the exemption would `` require the government to make supplies of marijuana available to <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>'s church on a regular basis.'' `` We are unaware of any ` free exercise' precedent for compelling government accommodation of religious practices when that accommodation requires burdensome and constant official supervision and management,'' <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> wrote in the opinion joined by Circuit Judge <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberman </PERSON>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> filed a dissent, saying <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> had not adequately explained why it denied <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>'s claim but granted a religious exemption for the use of peyote to the <ORGANIZATION> Native </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, an American Indian religion. `` This denominational preference constitutes a violation of the establishment clause'' of the Constitution that bars the government from setting up an official religion, <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> has chosen to accommodate one religion but not another,'' he wrote. `` The establishment clause compels the agency to justify its distinction and requires us to scrutinize the agency's rational strictly.'' <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>, reached by telephone at a <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, farm, said he would seek a rehearing of the case by the full appellate court. <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>, who says he served a five-year prison term for state and federal marijuana convictions, said he continues to use marijuana daily but no longer sells it. <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> said marijuana selling had hurt the reputation of the Ethiopian <ORGANIZATION> Zion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coptic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, from which he has dissociated himself. `` We want to make it clear we are not associated with selling marijuana,'' he said. `` The marijuana selling was just something _ a temptation that came in and overwhelmed people,'' he said. <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> denied that his disaffiliation from the church undermines his religious claim. `` We're still here for the same thing we came here for before _ the fellowship.''

 A federal judge today postponed <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s sentencing until July 5 to consider allegations of misconduct against a juror at the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide's Iran-Contra trial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ordered an evidentiary hearing to be held June 28 and directed court clerks to place details of the defense allegation on the public record. The court papers were to be released later in the day. But it is understood the defense had raised allegations of misconduct against juror <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, who told reporters after the trial that she had once used cocaine. Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said she did not use cocaine during the eight-week trial. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> granted a motion by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers to reconsider his earlier refusal to hold a closed hearing on the defense allegations. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> rescheduled the sentencing from Friday until July 5. Prosecutors have said <PERSON> North </PERSON> should go to prison because he broke the law during the Iran-Contra scandal, lied about it during his trial and still does n't show `` one iota of remorse.'' In a sentencing memo likening the fired <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide to the corrupt politicians of <LOCATION> Tammany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, prosecutors say <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` viewed and continues to view himself as being above the law and beyond reproach.'' The former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide faces a possible 10-year term for destroying evidence, aiding and abetting the obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and accepting an illegal gratuity. Letting North go without a prison term `` would be a statement that 15 years after Watergate, government officials can participate in a brazen cover-up, lie to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and collect a substantial gratuity and still receive only a slap on the wrist,'' prosecutors told <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> in their memo Monday. `` North's view that anything goes in a political controversy would be sustained'' by letting him off without a prison sentence, said the memo signed by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. `` Instead, since his acts are a serious breach of the public trust, they warrant serious punishment.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> did not make a specific recommendation of how much time North should serve in prison. North's lawyers are likely to file a response to the prosecutor's harsh statement. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> North </PERSON> concocted a false story to help win acquittal on a charge that he pocketed $ 4,300 in travelers checks entrusted to him by <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, a Nicaraguan Contra leader. North's testimony that he purchased a car with $ 15,000 in cash he accumulated in a box nailed to his closet floor `` echoed the flimsy lies offered by corrupt municipal officials in the days of Tammany Hall,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said, in a reference to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> political machine which ran the city from the mid-19th century into the 1930s and became synonymous with graft and fraud. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> called the steel box story `` preposterous'' and said `` North's perjury represents another indication of his continuing callous attitude toward the judicial process and our democratic institutions.'' Throughout the 12-page memo, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> repeated the theme that `` North has not indicated one iota of remorse for having committed crimes which, because of his position of public trust, jeopardized the constitutional processes of government.'' `` He apparently sees nothing wrong with alteration and destruction of official national security records,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. `` His participation in the preparation of a false and misleading chronology -LRB- of U.S.-Iran arms sales -RRB- has not led to any acknowledgement of wrongdoing,'' the prosecutor added. `` Certainly he sees nothing wrong with lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, when in the view of himself and his superiors lying is necessary,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. `` North seems to believe that such activities are business as usual in government or necessary tactics in a ` political firestorm.''' North's `` contempt for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the public is accompanied by venality in financial matters,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said of the retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel's acceptance of a $ 13,800 security system from arms dealer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, an Iran-Contra co-defendant awaiting trial. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said a prison term is necessary to reduce <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s political following that was cultivated on the lecture circuit and `` reinforces his lack of remorse.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s contention that he is a scapegoat. `` Few criminal defendants have attempted to blame so many others for so many lawless acts,'' the independent prosecutor said. `` North must accept his fair share of responsibility.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> also disputed <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s suggestion at the trial that whatever he did had the implicit authorization of higher <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials. `` This society can not tolerate government officials unwilling and unable to exercise independent judgment and responsibility in refusing to perform illegal acts,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. The sentence should show that `` one can not simply rely on real or imagined authorization of illegal conduct and expect to escape responsibility,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said.

 A girl who was stood up for a high school prom received a check for $ 81.28 from her date Tuesday to settle a dispute she had threatened to drag through small claims court. <PERSON> Tomontra </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangrum </PERSON>, 15, a sophomore, sued <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shadd </PERSON>, 17, a senior at another school, after he begged off their date claiming he had an injured ankle. `` I feel that this check proves that this was not silly at all,'' she said at a news conference. `` I did what I had to do, and I'm proud of it. The sum represented $ 49.53 for new shoes, a hairdo and flowers Ms. <PERSON> Mangrum </PERSON> bought for prom night, $ 19.50 to file the case in small claims court and $ 12.25 to have the lawsuit officially served. <PERSON> Shadd </PERSON>'s view of the case, which he said he settled only to end the dispute, was different from hers. `` It's just stupid,'' he said Monday. `` She's just freaking out. I do n't know what's wrong with her.'' Ms. <PERSON> Mangrum </PERSON> said she was trying to make a point about taking young people seriously. `` Always be truthful, especially with people my age,'' she said. `` It's a lot harder on young people.'' She said she has continued to date since the suit, and laughed when asked if her current dates worry she might sue them as well. `` Yes they do,'' she said. `` I hear them say, ` I would n't stand you up like that.''' <PERSON> Shadd </PERSON> said he's not angry with Ms. <PERSON> Mangrum </PERSON> for suing him. But he still maintains he called her a week before the prom to say he had hurt his ankle and would not be able to take her. The Mangrums admit he called, but insist he did not break the date. <PERSON> Shadd </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Mangrum </PERSON> have not spoken since the suit was filed, according to <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangrum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tomontra </PERSON>'s mother. `` He has refused to apologize to her, but she felt like the check was apology enough,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mangrum </PERSON> said.

 The son of Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> testw the slaying suspect, defendant <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, in a police lineup `` I was shocked ... because the man I saw was so similar to the picture I had in my mind.'' Palme, the dominant figure in Swedish politics for more than a decade, was killed Feb. 28, 1986, as he and his wife, <PERSON> Lisbeth </PERSON>, walked home from a late movie. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> has denied shooting the prime minister. The prosecution has accused <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, 42, of waiting for Palme to emerge from the theater, following the couple for several hundred yards, then shooting the Swedish leader. <PERSON> Marten </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>, a 28-year-old sociologist, said he noticed a man who looked like <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> as he and his girlfriend left his parents after discussing the film they had just seen together. `` I saw him looking at my parents intently. It's possible that he followed them, but I'm not sure,'' he told the court. But under questioning from defense attorney <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Liljeros </PERSON>, the younger <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> said he had compared memories of the man's appearance with his mother's recollections several times since the shooting. Also Tuesday, witness <PERSON> Lars-Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Eriksson </PERSON> told the court that he had seen a man who looked like <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> as <PERSON> Eriksson </PERSON> waited in a car for his parents to come out of the theater. `` I got a little frightened,'' said <PERSON> Eriksson </PERSON>, 29. `` I even locked the car doors, and I thought it's better not to look too much at him. This person can explode soon.'' Asked if he was certain <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> was the man he saw, <PERSON> Eriksson </PERSON> replied, `` Can you ever be 100 percent sure? But I am very sure.'' <PERSON> Birgitta </PERSON> <PERSON> Wennerling </PERSON>, a 47-year-old painter, said she noticed a suspicious man as she left an earlier showing of the film. He was straining to see over people's heads into the lobby, she said and `` had a sick, horrid look.'' She and <PERSON> Eriksson </PERSON> independently picked out <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> in police lineups. The trial adjourned until Wednesday. In a dramatic courtroom confrontation on Monday, Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> pointed to <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> and said she was `` absolutely certain'' he was the man she saw nearby as her husband collapsed with a fatal bullet wound. Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>'s testimony was crucial for the prosecution, which has suffered setbacks in trying to establish a motive and breaking the defendant's alibi. Prosecutors have no murder weapon and no witness who saw <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> with a gun in his hand. Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> said she looked at <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> three times after the shooting, at first for help. The prosecution has claimed no one else was on the scene who could have shot <LOCATION> Palme </LOCATION>.

Absolutely,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, director of the state forestry division. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 49, of <LOCATION> Delbarton </LOCATION> was sentenced after pleading guilty to setting a fire that destroyed 12,000 acres in the <LOCATION> Delbarton </LOCATION> area in November 1987, state forester <PERSON> Coy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> said. In addition to a 10-day jail sentence, a $ 500 fine and the 10-day fire-fighting detail, <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> also was placed on two years' probation, <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> said Monday <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> initially was charged with setting fire to property owned by someone else, a felony, and pleaded guilty to destruction of property, a misdemeanor, the <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> circuit clerk's office said. <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> was sentenced May 22, but <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> said his office just learned of the plea and the sentence last week.

<HEAD>Group Says Proposed New-Style Reactors Won't Help Global Warming
Problem</HEAD>

 The nuclear industry's proposed new-generation reactors, designed to operate more reliably and safely, will not be available soon enough to help the global warming problem, an anti-nuclear group said in a report Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Safe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said the nuclear industry was misleading the public by billing the advanced-design reactors as a partial solution to global atmospheric warming caused by emissions from fossil fuel plants. `` Nuclear power offers a ` fools gold' solution to global warming,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Denman </PERSON>, the group's director. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Antypas </PERSON>, a researcher at the council, said it's too early to tell whether new reactor designs will prove better and more economic than the current generation. `` It will take at least 10 years to develop and build a single demonstration plant, and another two or more decades to bring many of those plants on line,'' <PERSON> Antypas </PERSON> said. The proposed new reactors would rely heavily on `` passive'' design features to guard against a melting of the reactor core. A gas-cooled reactor, for example, uses helium as a coolant instead of water and its core is encased in graphite. This gives its operators more time to respond to problems because the gas can not boil away and the graphite takes hours to reach a dangerous temperature. <PERSON> Antypas </PERSON> said that even if the advanced-design reactors prove more safe and reliable than the current light-water reactors, the industry still will not have solved the problem of long-term disposal of wastes generated by the plants. The group said more emphasis should be placed on improving energy efficiency in transportation, buildings, appliances and utilities instead of spending billions on new nuclear plants. Many in the nuclear industry believe that widespread adoption of the new reactor technologies is vital to restoring public confidence in the safety and efficiency of nuclear power.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today approved trade concessions for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, two Soviet-bloc nations that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will visit next month. With no debate or dissent, the committee agreed to a bill that makes exports from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> eligible for duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> quickly gave the measure approval by voice vote and sent it to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. A second bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> by voice vote would allow a five-year extension of most-favored-nation trade status to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. That has the effect of suspending a law that bars trade concessions to certain communist nations until the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is satisfied they have liberalized emigration policies. That 1974 law, known as the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, usually requires that any exemption be reviewed every year. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulze </PERSON>, R-Pa., complained because the suspension for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s benefit would be subject to a review only after five `` We take a very important step when we change Jackson-Vanik,'' <PERSON> Schulze </PERSON> said. `` It's symbolic around the world.'' Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., who chairs the committee's trade subcommittee, said the five-year suspension is justified because no emigration complaints against <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> are pending `` <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, of all nations, has demonstrated its continued interest in freedom,'' he said. Few American investors are willing to put their money into <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and take the risk of having the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> withdraw trade concessions after only a year, <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> added. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the committee, said it is expected that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will complete action on the concessions this week

 <PERSON> Bich </PERSON> <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> spoke almost no English and was too afraid to talk when she entered <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> two years ago. Now she's at the head of her class and among a remarkable array of this year's valedictorians at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> high schools. The list includes students born in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. One of the four U.S.-born graduates among the 17 scholars is a ward of the state. The explanation for the unusual mix lies in a lot of new faces in the city and a lot of old values, educators say. `` When you've been running for your life in the jungles just to get your freedom, you're not looking for the good life; you're looking for survival They come in and they're willing to do anything and work anywhere. It's the same with all immigrants,'' <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Winegar </PERSON>, principal of the 900-student <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. <PERSON> Duc </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoang </PERSON> <PERSON> Vo </PERSON>, valedictorian at the 1,000-student <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, was beaten by Thai pirates when his family fled <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> by boat. His sister was kidnapped during the voyage. He said he had to do well; he owed his family. `` When my -LRB- parents -RRB- left their country they left everything behind,'' said <PERSON> Vo </PERSON>, 18, who emigrated seven years ago. `` They dropped everything at once, including my grandmother, just to give us a better future.'' `` Being a minority, I work harder for a better future, success and to make my parents proud,'' said <PERSON> Vo </PERSON>, who will study medical engineering on a full scholarship at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> this fall. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON>'s family also made some wrenching decisions to get her into an American school. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON>, who has a full scholarship to <ORGANIZATION> Emmanuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, came here with her father. Her mother, two brothers and a sister were left behind in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> because there was n't enough money for all of them to emigrate. She and her father floated seven days and nights without food or water before they were picked up by an American ship. She said she wants from an education what she and her father, who was imprisoned for several years after the fall of <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>, could not get in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` Money is important but I want to have the power of knowledge,'' said <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON>. `` The knowledge can do something the money ca n't do. It can get respect from other people.'' She earned it in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, site of many bitter racial clashes during forced busing of the 1970s. <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON>, 17, said he and his family felt they could not make enough money in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, and his parents did not want their three sons serving in the army. He said he learned good work habits in his home country, where teachers and education are widely respected. He is headed for the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Massima </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiocca </PERSON>, 17, of <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said he'd noticed the high number of foreign-born students who were valedictorians this year <PERSON> Chiocca </PERSON>, whose family came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> about three years ago, said Americans might be taking their education for granted. `` Seems like people from other countries are taking over this place. I'm one of them, but there's enough space for a lot of people,'' he said. `` Since I started school in first grade my mother always pushed me to do my best,'' said <PERSON> Chiocca </PERSON>, who will attend <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the fall. <PERSON> Clarice </PERSON> <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON>, 22, a deaf immigrant from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>, a former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony off the coast of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, spoke only <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> when she arrived in 1982, said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Donohoe </PERSON>, an adviser at the <ORGANIZATION> Horace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for the Deaf. `` They come here and see the possibilities and they know it means work if they want to succeed,'' <PERSON> Donohoe </PERSON> said.

 Sculptor and philosopher <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Neizvestny </PERSON>, who emigrated from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1976, said Tuesday that <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> was a good critic of 19th century capitalism but a bad prophet. <PERSON> Neizvestny </PERSON>, who gained fame for his differences over art with former Soviet leader <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, spoke to about 500 people as part of a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Summer School series of lectures on democracy, freedom and free-market economics. The artist did not elaborate on <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, whose prediction that capitalism will inevitably self-destruct into communism is taught to every schoolchild in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The audience responded to the comment with quiet laughter and grunts of acknowledgement. <PERSON> Neizvestny </PERSON> had a rocky relationship with <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>. They met when the Soviet leader came to a rare exhibition of modern art and termed <PERSON> Neizvestny </PERSON>'s work `` garbage.'' The sculptor strode up and started arguing. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> later asked <PERSON> Neizvestny </PERSON> to create his grave monument, which marks the final resting place of the former Soviet leader in <LOCATION> Novodevichy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The 64-year-old sculptor told his audience the flood of famous Soviet artists and performers who have left their homeland will stop when they are certain they can leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and know they can return _ and then leave again. `` I always had a fear of being parochial,'' for lack of the ability to travel, he said. Emigration clearly solved that, he said. But he also found that his life in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> left him afraid only of prison and death, so less-serious difficulties such as poverty or the opinions of others have had little effect. The lecture was arranged by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and a group seeking to establish an American university in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee on Tuesday passed legislation that would limit civil contempt of court jailings in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, a bill designed to help a mother who has been jailed 22 months in a child custody dispute. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a prominent plastic surgeon, was jailed by <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> after she refused to tell him where she had sent her six-year-old daughter <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>. He has said repeatedly he will not lift his contempt citation until she gives the information. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> has been trying to prevent any visit between the child and <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>, the girl's father. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> has accused <PERSON> Foretich </PERSON>, her former husband, of sexually abusing the child; he has repeatedly denied it. The legislation, designed to apply retroactively to <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s case, would limit civil contempt jailings in the district to 12 months, unless the judge in the case changes the charge to criminal contempt, a charge that would require a trial People could be held on criminal contempt charges during the trial, but not longer than 18 months. The bill also requires that a different judge hear the criminal contempt charges. `` We do not seek to place a limitation on the amount of time an individual can be sentenced to serve if convicted of criminal contempt,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., a co-sponsor of the bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` Our aim was to preserve the basic right of individuals to due process under the law.'' Nine of the members of the committee voted for the legislation, with only Rep. <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON>, D-Calif., voting against it <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> said the legislation is expected to go before the full House next week.

<HEAD>States Oppose Measures to Make Them Expand Eligibility</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Physicians and children's advocates told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that making more women eligible for Medicaid prenatal care would help reduce the nation's high rate of infant deaths. However, the states, which share the cost of the health insurance program for the poor with the federal government, opposed measures backed by the administration and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> requiring states to expand eligibility in their Medicaid programs. The administration is proposing to require states to admit to their Medicaid programs women and infants with incomes up to 130 percent of poverty. Sens. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, introduced a bill Monday to require coverage for women and children up to 185 percent of poverty. The need for prenatal care to reduce infant mortality `` has to be one of the nation's most pressing problems,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said at Tuesday's hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which he chairs. `` White American babies now die at a greater rate than babies born in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Minority babies born in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today have a greater chance of dying before their first birthday than babies in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> infant mortality rate ranks 20th among industrialized nations, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. A third of all pregnant women are not receiving prenatal care, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, and one in five children have no health insurance. `` The best way to ensure that a child will begin life as healthy as possible is to ensure the health of the mother during pregnancy through prenatal care,'' said <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of the Children's Defense Fund. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obstetricians </ORGANIZATION> and Gynecologists said the evidence is overwhelming that prenatal care reduces low birthweight. This condition, he said, is associated with two-thirds of neonatal deaths and 20 percent of postnatal deaths. Yet, Medicaid falls far short of meeting the health-care needs of poor women and children, witnesses said. Current law gives states until July 1, 1990, to cover all pregnant women and infants with incomes below the poverty line. Forty-four states now provide coverage to pregnant women and infants with family income below the poverty line, and 15 states provide such coverage for women and infants with incomes up to 185 percent of poverty, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s measure would require coverage for pregnant women and children up to age 6 with incomes below 185 percent of poverty, or $ 22,385 for a family of four, by Jan. 1, 1991. It would add 300,000 women and 1.6 million children. The change would cost about $ 1 billion annually, a cost that would have to be matched by the states. The administration's proposal would add a total of 374,000 women and children to the program and would pay for the change by reducing state matching funds for administrative costs. The states, however, oppose `` any further mandated eligibility requirements in the Medicaid program,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheppach </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. In the last year and a half, states have had to absorb the costs of sweeping changes in nursing home care and expanded benefits for the elderly, he said. Yet, states voluntarily have been moving to expand their Medicaid programs to make more women, infants and children eligible for benefits and will continue to make improvements as their budgets allow, he said. `` Individual states are in the best position to decide how Medicaid funds should be spent to assist citizens who are in need,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> welcomes the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s increased willingness to allow verification of nuclear weapons reductions and plans to build on that in new initiatives, the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator said Tuesday Negotiator <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> declined to discuss <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals in detail, but said `` we have noticed that the Soviets have taken a much more open and constructive approach on verification in recent years.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal came Monday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as the superpowers resumed Strategic Arms Reduction Talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> after a seven-month recess. The president said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should begin testing verification procedures during negotiations on reducing long-range nuclear forces, rather than waiting until a pact is completed. Such steps could involve trial inspections at each other's missile sites and discussions about equipment needed for verification, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said could be the most complex issue facing negotiators Tuesday's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as saying negotiators plan to suggest around-the-clock monitoring of some ballistic missile factories and on-site checks of missile warheads, to start before any new agreement. The proposal also was reported to include a ban on some missile flight tests. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> said that another aim of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan is to build support for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratification of a future arms treaty. Several superpower arms control treaties, including the 1979 SALT II pact on limiting long-range nuclear arsenals, remained unratified because the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decided the verification provisions were lax. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> said progress on verification would not become a condition in the START talks. `` We will continue to move on all fronts,'' he said. `` We are not proposing these measures as a take-it-or-leave-it package.'' The talks, aimed at reducing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet long-range bombers, missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent, are the latest round in negotiations that began four years ago. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> said at the news conference that their aim is to `` speed resolution of outstanding issues and give added momentum'' toward completing a treaty. Under Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s philosophy of more openness, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has allowed Western experts to tour a Soviet chemical weapons site for the first time as part of efforts to negotiate a global ban. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet scientists also have exchanged visits to each other's nuclear testing sites to examine ways of monitoring two 1970s treaties limiting atomic blasts that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> never approved. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> confirmed that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's review of arms policy did not result in a change in the Strategic Defense Initiative, which calls for space-based missile defenses, a divisive issue since arms talks began. He rejected Soviet attempts to link a START treaty to agreement on what <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says would be crippling curbs on SDI. On Monday, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON>, head of the Soviet delegation to the talks, met with <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> for 80 minutes at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mission. <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON> spoke of `` a good start'' and held out the prospect of unspecified Soviet initiatives. The talks are to last six to seven weeks. In detailed negotiations starting Wednesday with a full meeting of both delegations, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> will lead the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team and <PERSON> Lem </PERSON> <PERSON> Masterkov </PERSON> will continue as Soviet negotiator under <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON>. Disputes have developed over <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s demand for including sea-based cruise missiles in the treaty and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s call for a ban on mobile missiles. At earlier talks boths sides agreed to lower ceilings of 6,000 nuclear warheads and 1,600 delivery vehicles _ missiles and bombers _ for each side.

 Afghan secret police Tuesday interrogated an American photographer captured while traveling with Moslem guerrillas, diplomatic sources said. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> confirmed an American was being interrogated for his `` ill intentions.'' `` He is being interrogated in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, but we would like to assure that there will be no violent actions against him.'' <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the American entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> illegally. Free-lance photographer <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, was caught Wednesday in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, guerrilla sources in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, 43, is with <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> photo agency and was on assignment for Life magazine. `` We were told he probably was arrested for illegally entering the country,'' said the agency's president, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Abood </PERSON>. `` He had no visa. He probably went in through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and got caught. We're not sure what the circumstances were.'' He said <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> had been covering the Afghan war from the Pakistani frontier city of <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>. Diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> was being questioned by the Afghan secret police, called <LOCATION> Khad </LOCATION>, in one of their offices in the capital. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the American entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> without valid travel documents. `` It is our right to arrest him,'' he said. `` We are allowing journalists to come to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and stay here. Why did he choose to come in company of terrorists? This gives us a right to assume that he is a saboteur, he may even be a spy.'' <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the prisoner was in good health and his family had approached the Afghan Embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` But we have no other contacts with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government,'' he said. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> closed its embassy in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> last winter, citing fears of a bloodbath after the Soviet army ended nine years of involvement in the war and left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in February. In the past five years, seven foreigners have been arrested in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Amani </PERSON>. He said five were journalists and two were West German physicians. All were released after their countries intervened, <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said. The guerrillas have been fighting the Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government for 11 years with help mainly from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> had made several trips into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> with the guerrillas and his photographs have appeared in major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> publications.

<HEAD>House Subcommittee Accepts Cheney Procurement Budget</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee voted Tuesday to accept <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s $ 69 billion procurement budget with no add-ons, endorsing a proposal from the panel's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman by a slim margin. The procurement and military nuclear systems subcommittee, by a vote of 10-9, approved the amendment of Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., who had urged members to give <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> a vote of confidence and prevent add-ons totaling $ 7.2 billion The full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will vote on the amendment next week. `` While the budget may not be perfect, it's a darn good product _ especially given the 39 days <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> had to put it together,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> told the panel. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> and two other Democrats _ <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> _ joined seven of the panel's eight Republicans in approving the measure. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> was the lone <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member to vote against the plan, which basically removes the right of members to rewrite the $ 300 billion fiscal 1990 budget to restore local projects canceled by <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said he was pleased to hear about the vote. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> refused to give odds on the measure's chance of winning approval in the full committee, but called the subcommittee's acceptance of a budget that terminates programs `` staggering. Some Democratic members complained that approval of the measure could signal the end of the subcommittee's authority. `` A yes vote ... would be abrogating ourselves out of business,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, D-Ind., who voted against the amendment Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisisky </PERSON>, D-Va., who also opposed the amendment, said approval was not a vote of confidence for <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> because there was no guarantee that the defense budget would n't be changed on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor `` I think I'm giving up my rights if I have to vote for something that I can only change on the floor,'' <PERSON> Sisisky </PERSON> said. `` I think we're making a big mistake and it has nothing to do with a vote of confidence. Some members have pressed for restoring the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> F-14D Tomcat fighter and Marine V-22 Osprey, which <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> canceled, at the expense of other projects. If restored, the F-14D would add $ 366 million and the V-22 $ 700 million. Other possible add-ons include $ 55 million in new equipment for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> P-3 anti-submarine aircraft, $ 436 million for <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-130s and $ 240 million for heavy trucks made in <LOCATION> Oshkosh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> argued that although <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> did n't strong-arm his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> colleagues on the amendment, `` there are people on that side who are very much for the Osprey that ... have been strong-armed by the secretary of defense. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., said `` no one on this side of the aisle was strong-armed. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> whip who served as representative from <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, has the `` mildest, softest touches on the Hill,'' <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said after the vote that lobbying was fierce on both sides, with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> pushing for adoption of the amendment. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures the B-2 stealth bomber, fears losing funds for its program to support other defense projects. Lobbying against the plan were <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, builder of the F-14, and the alumni association of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, backers of the V-22 Osprey. Shortly after the vote, Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said he would fight to save the F-14, which is manufactured in <LOCATION> Bethpage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has accepted the city's invitation to reschedule a mock beach assault that was canceled after religious and peace groups opposed it. The City Council, after hearing emotional testimony during a meeting Monday night, voted 6-3 to extend the invitation. Lt. Commander <PERSON> Luanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recruiting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, said Tuesday the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will contact city officials soon about reviving the Park Point mock assault. The exercise involving 200 Marines was to be part of a recruiting and goodwill visit July 21-23 by the <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, a tank landing ship. City Council President <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> and members of several religious and peace groups earlier had persuaded the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to cancel the show. Many had complained that it would glorify war and damage the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION> beach. The council's action followed emotional testimony by veterans and peace activists. Those in favor of the mock assault argued that the military needs such exercises to train. Some said such shows instill valuable pride in the military, enhance recruiting and demonstrate strength. `` If you're strong, nobody will muck around with you,'' said veteran <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Solon </PERSON>. Those against the assault said it would glorify violence, falsely advertise military jobs as glamorous and advocate wasting money that could be spent on social needs. `` The real issue is political,'' said veteran <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>. `` This is a demonstration on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to get support for military spending.''

 A consultant with ties to former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> helped a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> housing project secure funding last year after federal housing officials rejected the plan, a newspaper reported today. The consultant, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, is a nephew of former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> and was an aide to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> when he was governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday he had n't done anything out of the ordinary in approaching lawmakers on behalf of the developer, and rejected implications he used personal influence on behalf of his client. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> is the latest on a growing list of prominent Republicans who successfully represented developers seeking help from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, the Times said. The Times said documents show that after the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> rejected a plan for the agency to provide mortgage insurance for a $ 5 million housing project for the elderly in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, a handwritten note from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> on Aug. 23 said his senior staff would give `` very careful consideration'' to an appeal from the developers. The note responded to a letter dated Aug. 22 from Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., who had asked <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> to reconsider the project Less than two weeks later, the documents showed, the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>' office decision was reversed <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said he asked several elected officials, including both <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> senators and a congressman to query <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> about the case, and said that is standard procedure for a consultant seeking review of a project. `` The implication is that I called my uncle and he called <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's garbage. I never talked to my uncle on that trip. We talk but it's always about family matters _ we have an unwritten rule about that.'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said he contacted <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s staff because the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> senator serves on the Select Committee on Aging, and because he knows <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said he and his firm in <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Niguel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, received about $ 15,000 in fees for its work on the project. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, who said his share of the fee was `` a few thousand dollars,'' said his firm does consulting and lobbying work for health care businesses, mostly with the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> but also in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We were hired not for influence, but for our understanding of the process,'' he said. Developer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said he and his partners hired <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> to get `` some political influence, some political interest in our appeal so that the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> people would consider it.'' The <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> office rejected the project because of what officials there said was a relatively weak market for housing for the elderly. The 68-unit project, a blend of apartment buildings and a convalescent hospital now under construction, is called <ORGANIZATION> Rosewood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Francisco Street residents are tired of living in fear because of rampant drug dealing and prostitution in their neighborhood. So they're fighting back _ in small claims court. Fifteen homeowners and renters have filed mental anguish claims for $ 2,000 each against the owner of the five-unit apartment building residents contend is the wellspring of neighborhood crime, illicit sex and drugs, all linked to sales of cheap, potent crack cocaine. Instead of soda cans and drifting newspapers, the neighborhood of modest Victorians and new condominiums has been littered with used syringes and condoms. `` I ca n't walk down the street anytime,'' said <PERSON> Elisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, 18. `` People think I'm a prostitute.'' Her 15-year-old brother was robbed at gunpoint. One neighbor found a bloody syringe next to his child's swing. A second encountered a prostitute having sex on a picnic bench outside his back door at noon. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, who has lived in the area for four years, said the neighborhood was being ruined by drug dealing on the sidewalks and prostitution in the schoolyard, constant traffic and the sounds of fighting inside two apartments linked to narcotics sales. `` Our purpose is not to gouge anyone for lots of money, but to get the criminality removed,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Perocier </PERSON>, who has lived on <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> for 29 years, said her car has been broken into twice and items have been stolen from her garage. She said a man across the street was burglarized twice by thieves who ripped his deadbolt locks off with crowbars. `` He came back Sunday morning and even his underwear was gone, and he was wondering what he was going to wear to work,'' <PERSON> Perocier </PERSON> said. Residents say the drug and crime problems have grown worse in the past year and a half. The small claims filed in Berkeley-Albany Municipal Court blame the apartment building owner for negligence, creating a nuisance and endangering the neighborhood. Judge <PERSON> Jennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhine </PERSON> will receive final evidence in the case Wednesday and will rule later. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the small claims idea stemmed from news about a successful lawsuit by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> homeowners against airport officials who promised to abate noise but failed to follow through. Police spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the two-story apartment building in the middle of the block is well-known to police, who have served search warrants and made arrests there. <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetzel </PERSON>, who lives across the street, said she contacted owner <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> about the problems there several times since last October. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, contends <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> filed a notice on April 18 to evict the alleged trouble-makers. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> complained that <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>'s strict rent control law makes eviction difficult. About the troublesome tenants, <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is n't `` accepting any responsibility for their criminal behavior.'' Repeated calls to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> were not returned. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the apartment tenants have been evicted or have agreed to move soon. `` All we know is that the problem is at last being solved,'' he said. `` I know Mr. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> now has promised to clean this situation up, but the time it has taken has ruined our lives,'' said the resident who found the bloody syringe. He did not want to be identified. The neighborhood, in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>'s flatlands about a mile west of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> campus, has long had crime problems because of a busy thoroughfare nearby. Residents acknowledge that getting new neighbors in the apartment building wo n't eliminate all of their problems, but it will help. `` We will not do away with the petty kind of burglary that you have everywhere in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, but the problems of prostitution and fear on the street definitely will go away,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` If it can stay clean a year, I believe it will be solved.''

<HEAD>House Approves Extension of Reserve</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House on Tuesday approved an eight-month extension of the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's energy life jacket in the event of a repeat of the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo. On a voice vote, the House authorized the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to continue filling the reserve with 60,000 to 78,000 barrels of oil daily through next February, but postponed decisions on several key issues on how the stockpile may be used. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved similar legislation two weeks ago, but extended the program for another five years and raised the ceiling on the reserve from 750 million barrels to 1 billion barrels early in the next century. In response to oil price surges after the Exxon Valdez tanker spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> two months ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also expanded President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s authority to tap the reserve for domestic as well as foreign supply interruptions. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> included none of those measures in its bill, saying it wanted to give its <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> time to weigh the implications of any new policy directions. If the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> refuses to accept the House-passed bill, a conference committee would be named to develop a compromise version. If both chambers approve the compromise, the legislation would be sent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. While endorsing the effort to give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> more authority and flexibility on when he could tap the reserve in order to suppress sudden price spikes for oil, the administration had sought only a simple five-year extension of the program. Since the reserve was begun in 1975, some 570 million barrels of oil _ slightly less than a 90-day supply of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports at current levels _ have been put into storage in salt caverns on the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coasts.

<HEAD>Airlines Say Boeing Groundings Haven't Disrupted Schedules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 British airlines, whose <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400s were grounded for engine tests, said Tuesday they have managed to keep to schedule. British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and DanAir, the largest airlines operating the plane, said they were using spare aircraft or borrowing replacements from other airlines. Each has two 737-400s. Eight more 737-400s are operated by <PERSON> Novair </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> and Air UK-Leisure, which also reported no difficulties meeting schedules. <ORGANIZATION> DanAir </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Clegg </PERSON> said the airlines were hoping for word Wednesday on the outcome of inspections by <ORGANIZATION> SNECMA </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the company that manufactures the CFM56-3C engines jointly with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The 12 planes were grounded by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> eight days ago after two incidents in which <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400s were forced to make emergency landings because engine fan blades broke.

<HEAD>U.S. Rejects Nicaraguan Offer for Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday rejected a Nicaraguan offer to hold talks on improving relations, saying that there can be no accommodation unless certain conditions are met including free and fair elections. Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Monday he had asked Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> to go to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with the government's proposal for opening talks on normalizing relations. There have been no substantive talks between officials of the two countries in more than four years. State Department press officer <PERSON> Rudi </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> said an improvement in relations depends on holding free and fair elections under international supervision, the beginning of a genuine dialogue with the Nicaraguan opposition and `` an end to Nicaraguan support for subversion in the region.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has accused the Sandinista government of increasing its support for leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The administration also has been exerting heavy diplomatic and economic pressure on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to ensure that opposition parties are able to compete fairly in national elections set for next February. <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s professed intention of improving relations contrasts sharply with several recent actions by the Sandinista government, including the expulsion of two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats. The envoys were accused of fomenting labor unrest but the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has insisted they engaged in no wrongdoing. After his meeting Monday with <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told reporters, he had asked the prelate to `` mediate with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> so that a fluid dialogue can develop. We are willing to develop a dialogue with the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> government so foundations can be laid for normalizing relations between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> no longer provides military aid to the Nicaraguan resistance, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo imposed five years ago remains in effect and has contributed to the country's steep economic decline.

<HEAD>Compromise Reached on Natural Gas Decontrol Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators on Tuesday resolved a key difference in bills to remove all federal price controls on natural gas by Jan. 1, 1993. The compromise bill is expected to be signed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> within a few weeks. It is not expected to have a noticeable effect on retail prices for natural gas because most gas under controls already is selling below the official ceilings. The energy industry supports decontrol, while some consumer groups oppose it. Some other consumer groups, however, have taken what amounts to a neutral position. The only difference between the original <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills was in treatment of natural gas from newly drilled wells. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version had no provision for early deregulation of gas from such wells, whereas the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> wanted to lift price controls on them retroactive to March 23, 1989. In a compromise, the negotiators agreed that gas from wells drilled after the date of enactment of the legislation would be deregulated on May 15, 1991. All other gas not already decontrolled would be freed from the federal ceilings upon the renegotiation of sales contracts, or Jan. 1, 1993, whichever comes first. About two-thirds of the nation's natural gas was deregulated by the 1978 Natural Gas Policy Act. Natural gas accounts for about one-quarter of the nation's energy use. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration strongly supports complete decontrol, contending that it will stimulate more exploration for a fuel source needed to limit dependence on foreign oil. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed its original bill in April, while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill was passed earlier this month. The compromise bill must be voted on by both houses again before it is sent to the White House.

<HEAD>Younger Brother Can't Use Name as Trademark on Cheese</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, owners of the world's largest winery, won the right Tuesday to keep the younger brother they raised from using his own name as a trademark for his own cheese. A federal judge concluded that use of the name <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> on retail cheese is misleading because many consumers assume the brand is connected with E & amp; J Gallo winery. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> sells about 10,000 tons of grapes a year from his vineyards to his brothers but has no other connection with their winery, based at <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>, 90 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` There is substantial evidence of actual confusion,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON> wrote, citing retailers who asked if the cheese and wine were connected. However, the judge's permanent injunction permits <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> to use his name as a signature or in block letters below the words designating the variety of cheese if the label also includes a prominent trademark above that does not include the word <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said he expects to win on appeal. He criticized <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON> for appearing to use arguments by winery attorneys verbatim in his brief and failing to submit a decision separate from the findings and injunction. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said the findings failed to deal adequately with the question of whether `` a person is entitled to use his own full name on his own product.'' However, <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON>'s findings addressed the dilemma of using a common name that also is a well-known brand. `` If every person named <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> were entitled to use <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> as a consumer trademark, <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> might be adopted as a trademark on any imaginable product,'' <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON> wrote. `` Such proliferation of uses would destroy the unique nature of the Gallo brand, its distinctiveness and its commercial value.'' A month-long trial last fall offered rare glimpses of the family-owned winery's development from a provider of bulk wines without a brand during the Depression to fame and fortune for its cheap wines _ first Thunderbird in the 1950s, later the Gallo brand itself. Gallo Winery's sales now total $ 1 billion a year. A Gallo attorney said during an opening statement that in 1933 _ six weeks after their father killed ther mother, then committed suicide _ <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> began making wine with knowledge gained from a book they got at the public library. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>, now 79, has handled the winemaking ever since while <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON>, 80, became a widely recognized marketing expert. Even though they raised younger brother <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, now 67, after the deaths of their parents, the winery <PERSON> Gallos </PERSON> sued him after he began using his name on cheese in the mid 1980s. Winery attorney <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanger </PERSON> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> had to protect their trademark and a licensing agreement that let <ORGANIZATION> Gallo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> use the <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> name on cheese under an agreement by which winery inspectors checked that brand's quality. <ORGANIZATION> Gallo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has no other connection to the three <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> brothers. <PERSON> Wanger </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> were reluctant to sue their brother but were rebuffed when they offered to license him to use the <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> trademark if the winery were allowed reasonable quality control over his cheese. <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON> also commented on the issue of quality control, saying the winery and <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> <PERSON> Salami </PERSON> `` have reasonable grounds to be concerned that sale of cheeses by defendants under the <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> brand creates an undue and unnecessary risk of a serious health problem resulting from the sale of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo-brand </PERSON> cheese that may injure the Gallo brand.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered to drop a U.S.-proposed ban on mobile nuclear missiles Tuesday if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> goes along with his plan to build both the Midgetman and MX mobile missiles. Intensifying his drive for upgrading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategic forces, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told congressional leaders `` do n't pull the rug out from under us'' on the two-missile plan, according to presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s willingness to abandon the mobile-missile ban at the negotiating table in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> could enhance chances for congressional passage of his missile-building package, claimed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, who had criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for failing to make a strong-enough case for his two-missile program, said he came away from a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> meeting `` very encouraged'' about the future of both missiles <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments, relayed by participants at the meeting as well as by <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, signal a key modification of position for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in strategic arms reduction talks, known as START, that resumed on Monday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> after a seven-month hiatus. `` We would be prepared to adjust our position on the ban accordingly'' if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gives the go-ahead to both the MX and Midgetman proposals, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. However, he said in the absence of such congressional approval, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position favoring a ban on mobile long-range nuclear weapons would remain on the table. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., complained to Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> about the emphasis the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was giving to the issue of verification <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> are under instruction to try to work out some arrangements to insure compliance with an eventual treaty. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> told <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> the administration `` is risking a major blunder with no potential gain.'' The senator said concentrating on anti-cheating safeguards could divert attention from such major issues as reducing weapons arsenals. The result, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said, could be indefinitely postponing completion of an accord. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> assured <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> there was no `` ulterior motive'' in trying to pin down verification measures. In fact, he said, one purpose was to accelerate <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratification of the treaty by discussing enforcement with the Soviets in advance. The proposal to ban all mobile nuclear missile systems was made by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and embraced until Tuesday by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. It would apply to both the 10-warhead MX missile and the one-warhead Midgetman _ as well as to their Soviet counterparts, including the multiple-warhead SS-24s. However, the administration found itself in the position of advocating such a ban in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> while arguing on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> for more mobile-missile deployment. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in April proposed spending $ 1.2 billon next year to begin placing 50 existing MX missiles on rail cars; and another $ 100 million as a first installment on a $ 25 billion program to build the truck-based Midgetman by 1997. However, the plan has run into considerable opposition in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ both among those who contend the twin-missile program is too expensive and among those who favor one weapon or the other. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` We think a mobile capability is essential. Then you negotiate reductions as best you can.'' He said that moving ahead on both the MX and Midgetman missiles would give the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> more leverage at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks. He compared pressing ahead with the two mobile missile systems _ against the backdrop of the talks to reduce strategic weapons _ with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to go ahead with deployment of intermediate-range cruise missiles during negotiations that led to the 1987 U.S.-Soviet treaty to ban such weapons. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does pass those -LRB- MX and Midgetman -RRB-, then they would become part of our negotiations -LRB- in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he was satisfied by the outcome of the White House session. `` I think it's very clear that the president, the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> and the secretary of defense were willing and indeed indicated they would re-examine the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> position on banning mobile missiles if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approves both the MX rail-mobile and the Midgetman funding,'' he said. `` They made it clear, however, that they were not going to end up in a position permiting mobile missiles if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was not going to fund mobile missiles,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> also said he strongly supported the administration's proposal that efforts to reach agreement on verification procedures be nailed down between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators at the outset of talks on controlling long-range missiles Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., senior <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, lauded the president's position <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` clearly told us that if the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can get its act together and support the president on both programs, then the question of mobility would be revisited by the administration.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., told reporters `` it remains to be seen'' whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strong pitch for his two-missile plan would help it overcome opposition in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>

He is to hand over power on March 11 to the winner of a Dec. 14 election. But he said he will retain his command of the country's powerful army The constitution prohibits re-election of a president, but conservative groups have insisted that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> can run.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday told the 141 teenagers who are this year's Presidential Scholars they are doubly bound to answer his call to community service. Calling them `` some of the best and brightest students in American education,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` While already you've done much, I know you will do more _ and not for yourselves alone, but for nation and neighbor.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was joined by his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and Secretary of Education <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> for the ceremony held under threatening skies on the South Lawn of the White House. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is staging another White House event on Wednesday to launch his youth service initiative and will follow up with a speech in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Thursday, said, `` An educated person also has duties and responsibilities.'' `` The definition of a successful life must include serving others.

They were chosen by a commission _ 121 for academic achievements, leadership, character and ideals, and 20 for artistic accomplishments. Each Presidential Scholar got to bring his or her most influential teacher to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to share in the accolades, a five-day whirlwind of seminars, speeches, dinners and festivities that concludes Wednesday. `` Many have labored to share their knowledge with you and you can give them no greater gift than to share your knowledge with others,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that one of the scholars, <PERSON> Clarity </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ellington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, speaks both <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> and Spanish. `` I'm a little jealous.

 Trucks hauling food could not carry garbage under a bill introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by Rep. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, to head off what he said was a growing health hazard. `` Drivers who are bringing meat, produce and grain products from the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to the East Coast are often returning with bales of solid waste to be disposed of in landfills,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s bill would require the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> to adopt regulations prohibiting any vehicle that carries solid waste or hazardous waste from being used to transport food. Violators would be punished with criminal penalties of up to $ 350,000 and five years in jail. In a one-minute address to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said that the practice of carrying both food and garbage appears to be increasing as landfills in eastern states reach capacity. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> produces about 15,000 tons, or 750 truckloads, of solid waste daily to be sent to landfills in western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` Although these trucks must be licensed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> to haul garbage within or out of state, there are no requirements which prevent these same trucks from returning with a cargo of food,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The Armed Services have yet to detect any safety problems because of the alleged illegal substitution of scrap metal for designated alloys in engines for 5,000 military aircraft, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. According to a fraud indictment Monday in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, of three former executives of <ORGANIZATION> Aerodyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the company used scrap in making turbine blades of the type used in 22,000 jet aircraft, helicopters and tanks. `` Now, it's estimated that 5,000 aircraft have been equipped with these parts since 1982,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` Two million hours have been accrued on the aircraft without any known related incidents. `` There has been no noticeable degradation in performance using that 50-percent mixture.'' The blades were used in T-53 engine that's used on the Huey, Cobra and <LOCATION> Mohawk </LOCATION> helicopters for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> suspended the contractor last Aug. 16 `` because of the evidence of <ORGANIZATION> Aerodyne </ORGANIZATION>'s use of nonspecified alloys in making parts'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. The grand jury indicted three former <ORGANIZATION> Aerodyne </ORGANIZATION> executives, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> Sr. and <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Carman </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the alleged fraud was discovered by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general, who notified the military services and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Since then `` a new source has been since required to produce the parts,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Senate Committee Approves Measure to Deal with Oil Spills</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Oil Spill Plan, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee approved a bill Tuesday designed to deal with oil spills and try to prevent them through such steps as random alcohol testing of crews and improved radar systems for tracking tankers. The Oil Tanker Navigation Safety Act of 1989 deals directly with <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, where <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> continues cleaning up a massive spill, and would also affect tanker operations elsewhere. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Transporation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> announced a comprehensive inspection of the 800-mile <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> pipeline. He indicated that the March 24 rupture of the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> oil tanker prompted the inspection, originally set for 1991. `` The Exxon Valdez oil spill has taught us a valuable lesson: the need to avoid complacency when it comes to protecting our environment,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. He said the inspection will review operating pressures, repair procedures, protective coating requirements, routine inspection schedules and the electric current used to retard corrosion, along with oil spill contingency plans for the pipeline. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> also sent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a proposed bill to give the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> broader authority over mariners, including revocation of their certification if they have a record of drunken driving. That and several other provisions already were in the bill approved without opposition by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The bill, backed by Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, would open highway driving records of merchant mariners to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, provide for random and other alcohol testing of people in safety-senstive jobs on tankers and improve radar systems to aid the tracking of ships through potentially hazardous areas. It also requires the secretary of transportation to examine several other safety steps and sets guidelines for oil spill contingency plans, including requiring some oil spill cleanup equipment to be prepositioned at strategic locations and other equipment to be carried aboard tankers. The legislation, consolidating six proposed bills arising from three <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearings on the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> spill, was sent to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as the oil industry unveiled its own plan for responding to major spills. The industry announced it would spend $ 250 million to set up a network of response teams capable of handling an accident as large as the March 24 disaster involving the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill would require at least three persons to be on the bridge of a tanker in certain waters, including the sound. The Exxon Valdez's captain had gone below deck and turned the helm over to his third mate, who was not licensed to navigate the sound. The captain, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, faces several charges in connection with the incident. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure would allow suspension of a merchant marine's license, following a hearing, for being drunk on the job or if there is a record of a highway driver's license being suspended or revoked within the previous five years for alcohol or drug use The legislation instructs the transportation secretary to examine whether newly constructed tankers should be built with double hulls or double bottoms and also to conduct a study of whether the size of tankers being built is a factor in oil spills. The Exxon Valdez carried over 50 million gallons. Sen. <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON>, R-Wash., said he would propose on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor an amendment that would impose financial punishment on companies responsible for oil spills, including a possible giving up of all profits for one year if in a case of `` gross or willful negligence. The money would go into an environmental fund.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s committee to enhance <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade competitiveness began work Tuesday as Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> promised to shore up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests against the consolidation of European markets. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competitiveness </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to restructure its economies into a single European market by 1992 has caused concern among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses. `` I share some of those concerns, but fundamentally EC-92 is both a challenge and an opportunity for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> and the Coalition For Employment Through Exports. The Council on Competitiveness, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, will review federal laws to ensure they do n't unfairly restrict <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies against European competitors. The vice president said the council also would ensure <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> access to and fair competition in the single European market, and would re-evaluate policies on deregulation of financial institutions and anti-trust restrictions. American companies complain that antitrust measures prevent them from competing fairly because European countries are not restrained by the same standards. Many of the antitrust policies are `` anachronistic in this age of global competition,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, adding that merger law reform is needed. `` We need to consider reducing present incentives for price antitrust litigation,'' he said. The vice president said the area of biotechnology, in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been a leader, will be reviewed. `` The key to our success in marketing new biotechnology products has been a sensible regulatory regime that applies basic competitiveness principles,'' he said, but cautioned against unnecessary regulatory burdens on product development. `` We need to consider ways to improve incentives for private sector investment,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, citing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to reduce the capital gains tax, make permanent tax credit payments for research and development and ease the patent applications process. The Council on Competitiveness, whose members include cabinet members involved with trade issues, was set up by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to continue the work of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s task force. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s task force dealt with eliminating excessive government regulation.

<HEAD>Government to Pay for Development Stage of Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, in a policy shift from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era, has decided that the government will pay the full cost of readying new weapons for production, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said Tuesday. For the past eight years, government and defense contractors have split the development cost of most weapons systems. That policy will change, the new No. 2 <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official, Deputy <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>, revealed in a published interview. <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>'s proposal was embodied in a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> management review that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> approved and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, acording to other <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials. The policy change does not require congressional review. `` We're just going to implement it,'' said <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>. The old system does not encourage defense contractors to develop the most efficient weapons and means of producing them, <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> said. `` It encourages them to skimp,'' he said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. Pentagon officials distributed the text on Tuesday. `` The consequence is, lo and behold, we end up in production with something that's difficult to build. We did n't put the time and effort into it,'' said <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>, a former executive at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He did not offer any specific examples, but the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has had trouble in recent years in the performance of several costly weapons. The development contract, said <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>, `` is when you should put your effort into designing it for simplicity and producibility, of designing it for reliability and performance and quality. And it is not the time you skimp. That is the whole purpose.'' The shift, which is likely to be hailed by the defense industry, will not affect existing contracts on major weapons systems, such as the B-2 `` stealth'' bomber or a new class of attack submarines. But <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said in a statement that future contracts for full-scale development of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s new Advanced Technology Fighter `` may reflect the change in contract policy.'' In outlining the new policy, <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> distinguished between research that contractors pursue on various weapons-related technologies and the money they spend developing actual weapons for the government. `` I think the government should pay the bill for the development phase,'' he said. `` By the development, I mean the early-on demonstration, validation phase, and for the full-scale development.'' `` Now, I do n't want to hold out any bonanza to any industry that thinks, ` Well, we'll get all the money we want. Quite the contrary,'' he said.

 The new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy to Afghan rebels said Tuesday he plans to meet with their leaders to stress continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support as they `` conclude successfully the final phase of their struggle'' against the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomsen </PERSON>, a career diplomat, commented after taking the oath of office for the newly created position.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> confirmed Tuesday it will make a closer study of environmental risks posed by a prototype plutonium refinery, a move that a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel chairman says will delay start of plant construction at least two years. The department has called the plant a key to modernization of the nation's nuclear weapons production complex. It would use a new laser technology to convert existing military stockpiles of fuel-grade plutonium to weapon-grade material. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, chairman of a special <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> panel, said <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> had made the decision in response to an environmental group's threat last April to sue to force such a study. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Callicott </PERSON>, a department spokesman, said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> had notified selected members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of his decison on Monday and Tuesday, although no general announcement was made. The move was made, <PERSON> Callicott </PERSON> said, because of `` our own wish to put any public doubt to rest ... as to the environmental safeguards for the project.'' He declined to say how long the environmental study would delay the refinery project. <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> had committed the department to conducting a formal Environmental Impact Statement on the prototype, which is being built at the department's <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The Livermore project is a prototype for a permanent plutonium refinery, called the Special Isotope Separation plant, that the department wants to build at the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. An environmental study of the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> site already has been completed. <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON>'s panel, which is reviewing <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans for modernizing the nuclear weapons complex and cleaning up its hazardous wastes, last week voted to recommend withholding funds for beginning construction at <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> in 1990. In a statement announcing <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' decision, <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON> said he was pleased by the move. `` It signifies to the people of <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION> and vicinity that their concerns for health and safety are shared by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, and more broadly, it is a tangible sign of what Secretary <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> calls a ` change of culture' at <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. The Natural Resources Defense Council, which notified the department last April that it would sue if an environmental assessment were not performed, said it was pleased by the decision. `` We scored a victory,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reicher </PERSON> of the council. `` It's a combination of the strong position we believe we have, plus congressional pressure. <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON> said it would take at least 12 months to finish the environmental study, and that the start of construction at <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> is likely to be delayed at least two years.

<HEAD>Report Says Star Wars Research Less Costly Than Bush Proposal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can conduct Star Wars research and development far more cheaply than the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is proposing, acording to a congressional report released Tuesday. The three types of budget options described in the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report would cost $ 11.3 billion to $ 18.4 billion from 1990 to 1994, rather than the $ 31.1 billion proposed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the same period. `` If we spend billions on strategic defense that does not really defend us _ and siphon these billions from the budgets of fighter planes, ships, tanks and personnel _ we may not make the country more secure,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who requested the report. `` For this reason, the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> report bears careful study.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cut spending on the Strategic Defense Initiative to $ 4.6 billion for fiscal 1990, down from the $ 5.9 billion proposed by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will shift the focus of Star Wars from deployment sometime in the 1990s to research on a more advanced system known as `` Brilliant Pebbles,'' consisting of thousands of orbiting satellites. Under the report's first option, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be protected against a Soviet breakthrough in technology or the Kremlin's deployment of a strategic defense system. Total spending would range from $ 11.3 billion to $ 14.5 billion and the option would be in compliance with the Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty, the report said. The second option, estimated at a cost of about $ 17 billion, would enable the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to defend parts of the country against a limited nuclear attack caused by an accident. That option may comply with the ABM Treaty, the report said. The third option, costing about $ 18.4 billion, would provide a larger strategic defense system that would protect land-based missiles housed in silos such as the MX and Midgetman. The report estimates did not include the cost of procuring the system.

 A federal judge Tuesday postponed the sentencing of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> to consider allegations that one of the jurors who convicted the former presidential aide lied during jury selection. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> set a hearing for June 28 on defense allegations that juror <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> had used drugs before the trial and had failed during jury selection to disclose that three of her brothers had arrest records. If the defense proves that it learned after the verdict that King deliberately withheld the information about her brothers during jury selection, the judge might be forced to grant a mistrial. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> released defense pleadings about the allegation that had been filed under court seal. They contained copies of <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> records indicating that one of Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s brothers, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, had an arrest record, including a 1987 conviction for armed robbery. Two other brothers were arrested on other charges but the cases were dismissed. A sister was involved in a child-custody suit with her estranged husband, according to court records produced by the defense. Before the trial, Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> indicated on a questionnaire for prospective jurors that no member of her family had ever been involved in a criminal or civil case, either as a witness or as the subject of an investigation. `` This apparently intentional misstatement raises serious questions as to juror bias and impartiality, and suggests that defendant was deprived of his right to exercise peremptory and causal challenges in an informed manner,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers said. In another pleading unsealed by <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers said `` the possibility that a juror might have been under the influence of narcotics during trial calls into question the fairness of the proceeding and warrants further inquiry.'' Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> told reporters after the verdict that she had used marijuana and cocaine before the trial but not while she sat on the jury that convicted North of three felony counts. North, a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide, had been scheduled to be sentenced Friday. He faces a possible 10-year sentence for aiding and abetting in obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, destroying or mutilating official documents and accepting an illegal gratuity _ a security system outside his house _ from arms dealer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> postponed sentencing until July 5. After receiving the court documents about Ms. <PERSON> Kings </PERSON>' brothers, the judge granted a motion by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers to reconsider his earlier refusal to hold a closed hearing on the defense allegations. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> directed <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers to file `` a full written statement indicating the precise time and date when counsel first learned each fact documented in support of the request for reconsideration, noting in each instance the name and address of each and every person supplying the information.'' Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> contended in another brief unsealed Tuesday that <PERSON> North </PERSON> has the burden of showing that his lawyers obtained the information about Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s family after the May 4 verdict. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> noted that media reports during the trial that two other jurors had given incorrect answers to the same question by failing to disclose they had been parties to civil suits arising from traffic accidents. North's lawyers did not seek to dismiss either of those jurors and replace them with alternates. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> also suggested that King's false statement on the questionnaire may have been inadvertent because she has 14 brothers and sisters. It was possible that `` any knowledge she did have simply did not come to mind at the time she completed the jury questionnaire,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. He also pointed out that Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> is almost 17 years younger than the brother convicted of armed robbery. `` The involvement of the juror's relatives in prior legal proceedings,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> argued, `` gives rise to no inference that she harbored a bias against <PERSON> North </PERSON>.'' `` If Ms. King developed any prejudice from such experiences, it would likely be directed against the prosecution, not defendants,'' he said. In a court filing on Monday, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to imprison <PERSON> North </PERSON>, saying the retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel had not shown `` one iota of remorse'' and considered himself `` beyond reproach.'' The prosecutor charged that <PERSON> North </PERSON> had lied on the witness stand, concocting a false story to help win acquittal of a charge he pocketed $ 4,300 in traveler's checks that a Nicaraguan rebel leader had entrusted in him. North, 45, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel, was acquitted of nine charges in all.

 Hundreds of soldiers have failed to halt ethnic violence in a Central Asian city where weekend rioting killed three people and injured 53, Soviet reports said Tuesday. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said authorities imposed a 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew and banned all rallies in <LOCATION> Novy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uzen </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> republic, but `` clashes between warring groups of hoodlums are continuing in the town.'' Hundreds of soldiers were sent to Novy Uzen over the weekend to quell the fighting in the city that is an isolated gas and oil refining center in the harsh Caspian desert. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> said the rioting began Friday night in <LOCATION> Novy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uzen </LOCATION> and was aimed at minorities originally from the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> region on the other side of the Caspian Sea. It was the third outbreak of violence in the past six weeks in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The region has been buffeted by a soaring population, pollution, a shortage of jobs and rising ethnic tensions. About 100 people were killed earlier this month during 10 days of arson and attacks directed against the <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> minority in neighboring <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> where Uzbeks form the majority. In <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION>, a republic south of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, mobs rampaged through the streets in early May demanding that cooperatives be closed and Armenian traders be forced to leave the area. Official reports said most of the violence in <LOCATION> Novy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uzen </LOCATION> was against Armenians, Azerbaijanis and <PERSON> Lezgins </PERSON> who make up about 20,000 of the city's population of 56,000 people, with Kazakhs in the majority. <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> said about 7,000 people gathered Monday in the city's main square demanding that cooperative businesses be closed and people from the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republics be sent home `` Two battalions of Interior -LRB- Ministry -RRB- soldiers were brought in to stop the unrest,'' he said. `` The crowd was dispersed, but it broke into several large groups of youths armed with pipes and stones and other objects. They went along the streets, organizing brawls, pogroms and arson.'' <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> said three people were killed and 53 injured according to preliminary reports and there were 57 arrests. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said said two Kazakhs and one Lezgin were killed. Official reports said the trouble began with a fight between ethnic groups at a dance. Hundreds of young people roamed the streets breaking windows and setting fire to cars and buildings. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported 59 shops were damaged, five cars burned and many windows broken. It said soldiers fired in the air and used cheremukha, a chemical substance similar to tear gas, to break up the mobs. The military has said cheremukha was used when troops crushed a pro-independence protest in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, on April 9. Twenty people were killed in the violence. More than 700 people, mostly women and children, were evacuated from <LOCATION> Novy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uzen </LOCATION> to a heavily guarded bus station 8 -LCB- miles from the city, <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> said. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported many returned home after the situation quieted down. It said the native Kazakhs `` complained to the leadership about bad social conditions of life in the city and high prices for essential goods.'' They demanded that people from the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> region be forced to move and that gas and oil production plants stop bringing in workers for work shifts of a week or longer, according to <LOCATION> Izvesti </LOCATION>. It said the protesters claimed the imported workers live better than the local population. The protesters were particularly angry at cooperatives owned by the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> minorities, <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> said. Cooperatives are small, privately owned businesses that have been permitted under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms as an alternative to the state-run economy. Many Soviets suspect cooperative owners of profiteering and serving as fronts for organized crime.

<TEXT>
 Residents of this arid county in western <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, home to military installations, industrial plants and waste disposal facilities, are no strangers to pollution hazards. And now, state officials have been told that <ORGANIZATION> AMAX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magnesium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which extracts metal from evaporation ponds on the western shore of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, is the nation's single greatest source of toxic air pollutants, specifically chlorine, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` Certainly we're not proud of the designation,'' <ORGANIZATION> AMAX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` But the fact is, we've been cognizant of the emissions and have done environmental studies that show absolutely no discernable effects.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the plant, about 65 miles from <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and 40 miles from the nearest community, employs about 600 workers who extract magnesium chloride salt from the briny water and process magnesium and liquid chloride for a variety of industrial uses. Even now, the company is installing devices to reduce the emission of chlorine gas from the stacks by 50 percent at year's end and a total of 75 percent by 1991, state environmental health officials say. What concerns some officials more than <ORGANIZATION> AMAX </ORGANIZATION>'s emissions is that <LOCATION> Tooele </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, with its immense deserts and desolate mountains, has become a favorite destination for low-level hazardous wastes from producers in and out of the state. Radioactive tailings from an old uranium mill in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> are buried there. Hazardous waste disposal sites are in operation or on the drawing boards, one waste incinerator is under construction and another has been proposed. At Dugway Proving Ground, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has conducted germ warfare defense testing for decades, and <ORGANIZATION> Tooele </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> stores much of the nation's arsenal of obsolete chemical weapons. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> uses hundreds of square miles of the county for bombing runs and jet fighter training. `` People drive out there, and they think of all this wasted land,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a 10-term Democrat. `` But we have mountains, streams and deserts. It is n't just nothing. I've been saying for years that I hope we do n't turn into the dumping ground of the world. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> shares her concerns. He praised the strict criteria county officials have established for siting, mitigation and emergency response capabilities when approving new hazardous waste and other developments with a potential for pollution. `` But along with expertise in knowing how to handle, manage and work with a hazardous management zone, comes a feeling of growing confidence,'' he said. `` Just like with TAD, there's an attitude of, ` We can live with these things.' Is Tooele going to be the hazardous-waste frontier?'' However, <LOCATION> Tooele </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> says the potential perils of hazardous waste and pollution or accidents at Dugway or <ORGANIZATION> Tooele </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> must be weighed with the economic benefits to its 30,000 residents. Besides, he said, all are strictly regulated by a variety of local, state and federal agencies. `` I'm not trying to downplay the health factors,'' he said. `` But we are trying to balance the two _ health factors and economics.''

 An Indian family, needing money to pay medical bills, has sold a historic buckskin shirt that belonged to the adopted son of Sitting Bull in a deal that allowed the clothing to be donated to the state museum. The pullover, decorated with beaded strips and patches, was worn by One Bull in the 1920s, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Dill </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s museum division, said in a statement Tuesday. `` One Bull was an important figure in the state's history, having fought at the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bighorn </LOCATION> and being a close associate of Sitting Bull,'' <PERSON> Dill </PERSON> said. `` This is a major gift, a real treasure.'' Sitting Bull, a <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> leader, adopted One Bull when the boy was 4 years old, <PERSON> Dill </PERSON> said. One Bull, who died in 1948 at the age of 105, was credited with killing four of Lt. Col. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> <PERSON> Custer </PERSON>'s soldiers during the Battle of the Little Bighorn on June 25, 1876, said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Williston </LOCATION> dentist who bought the shirt. <PERSON> Bridget </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, currator of collections for the <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said the state has pictures of One Bull wearing the buckskin shirt, which makes it even more valuable as an historical artifact. One Bull's daughter, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> One </PERSON> <PERSON> Bull </PERSON> <PERSON> Tremmel </PERSON>, made the shirt for her father. She recently sold it to <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> so he could donate it and other items to the state, <PERSON> Dill </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> refused to divulge how much he paid Mrs. <PERSON> Tremmel </PERSON> for the shirt but said it had been appraised at between $ 10,000 and $ 15,000. He paid `` something less'' than the appraised value, he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Tremmel </PERSON>, 80, suffers from Parkinson's disease and was placed in a nursing home in <LOCATION> Mobridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, in April, said her daughter, <PERSON> Maethus </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON> Bear of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yates </LOCATION>.

 A Jewish settler pumped submachine gunfire into a crowd of Palestinians waiting for a ride near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> on Tuesday, wounding two people, police said. The shooting occurred shortly after angry settlers booed and shouted down Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, chanting `` Traitor! Traitor!'' as the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader tried to eulogize a U.S.-born settler slain Saturday in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` Revenge! Revenge!'' some screamed. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said some `` extremist reactions'' aim at jeopardizing government plans for elections in the occupied territories. `` I think some right-wing extremists in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are horrified by the peace plan,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. `` They still believe we can restore the status quo through the use of military force only.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military intelligence chief, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahak </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> may accept the election proposal because its ranks are split and there is more open criticism of chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. He also said international support for the uprising has declined. Police said they arrested three Palestinians in the stabbing death of settler <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>, 48. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported the army blew up the suspects' homes Tuesday. After <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>'s funeral, a 23-year-old settler approached Palestinians at a highway intersection and opened fire with an Uzi submachine gun, said police spokeswoman <PERSON> Dalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilad </PERSON>. He wounded two Palestinians, one seriously, she said. The gunman fled on foot, but was captured by police, Ms. <PERSON> Gilad </PERSON> said, refusing to name the settler. One witness told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> the man wore a checkered Arab headdress when he approached the intersection and fired, then pulled off the headdress and shouted `` I'm a Jew!'' before running away. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted police officials as saying the gunman wore a Jewish skullcap. <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> police refused to comment, saying there was `` a news blackout.'' Itim national news agency said the attacker was returning from <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>'s funeral, which took place 18 miles east of the shooting site where Palestinians from the occupied territories wait for transport home. The funeral began with a procession from Ariel settlement, where <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON> lived. It drew 500 settlers, most armed. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the crowd, `` The people of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are standing with you today.'' But most of his eulogy was drowned by shouts of `` Liar!'' and `` <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> go home!'' Settlers are demanding harsher measures to quell the 18-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and blame <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> for Arab attacks on settlers. At least 526 Palestinians and 23 Israelis have been killed since the revolt against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation began in December 1987. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s hard-line rival in the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, Industry Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, was not interrupted when he recited the Kaddish, or prayer for the dead, for <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> opposes <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s initiative to hold elections in the occupied lands. Fistfights erupted after the funeral, when furious settlers attacked a left-wing activist who attended the service. Soldiers who pulled the activist to safety also were struck. Three stone-throwing attacks on Arabs were reported, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Two Arabs were slightly injured and a third was in moderate condition in the hospital with injuries from rocks and flying glass. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> army commander, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> the Palestinian suspects encountered <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON> hiking alone near Arab villages outside Ariel. He said the Palestinians told interrogators that <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON> chatted with them, took their pictures with his camera and asked them to photograph him. One of the Palestinians then grabbed <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>'s knife and stabbed him in the back, <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> said. There was no motive, he said. The army identified those arrested as <PERSON> Fahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON>, 21, <PERSON> Bilan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Samrah </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Otman </PERSON> <PERSON> Amar </PERSON> <PERSON> Elhaj </PERSON>, 21, all from <LOCATION> Burkin </LOCATION> village near <LOCATION> Ariel </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs Tax Penalty Revisions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation Tuesday revising and simplifying most of the nearly 150 federal tax penalties. The measure generally would require the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to be less harsh on a taxpayer who tries to comply with the law but fails than on one who makes no effort to comply. It also aims to reduce chances that a taxpayer will be hit with two or more civil penalties for the same shortcoming. The committee, meeting behind closed doors, added the provision to a package that eventually is expected to include spending cuts and revenue increases required to reduce the budget deficit. Rep. <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said that his oversight subcommittee heard testimony that `` the current penalty structure is a confusing morass of complex, overlapping penalties that are often unduly harsh or just plain irrational.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, 35 years ago, had only 13 penalties to enforce. The increase, authorities say, is due in part to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' use of penalties to raise revenue. The rewriting is based on the notion that penalties should be used only to encourage compliance, not to raise money. In 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> assessed 26 million penalties totaling nearly $ 6 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> supports overhauling the penalty structure. Present law imposes a 5 percent penalty for underpayment of tax; the bill would raise that generally to 20 percent. Most of the changes involve penalties on banks and others that fail to file reports on interest and dividends, and on employers who miss the deadline for turning over withheld taxes to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. In most cases, the revised penalties would be graduated so that the longer the delay in paying or filing, the higher the penalty.

 Palestinian terrorists met with <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> to plan an attack at the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, but an Israeli agent warned West German authorities, Stern magazine said Tuesday. The Hamburg-based magazine said an agent from <LOCATION> Mossad </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> intelligence service, infiltrated the meeting, and his information prompted last week's security alert at the airport. The security measures are still in force at the airport, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s busiest. Police are conducting a nationwide search for suspects, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. It reported the terrorists were planning the attack in an attempt to gain the release of convicted <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> and two imprisoned members of the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said the terrorists met with Col. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> June 10 in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, the Libyan capital. It made no further mention of <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. The story will be carried in <LOCATION> Stern </LOCATION>'s Thursday edition, but the magazine sent a summary of the article to other news media Tuesday. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said the Israeli agent quoted terrorists at the meeting as saying: `` The time is right to free the fighters from prison. `` It is time to carry out the great attack. The means are in our hands. We possess a weapon that will drown many in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in blood and tears.'' West German security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the warning of a possible attack came from <LOCATION> Mossad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaletzke </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Hesse state <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> that is responsible for security at the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said he could neither confirm nor deny that Mossad provided the tip. But he said the information that had been received was considered reliable. `` The information ... was of such quality that we had to step up security,'' he said. When security was strengthened last week authorities said the measures were linked to <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s case. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, was convicted by a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> court last month of murder and air piracy in the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking and was sentenced to life imprisonment. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver was killed by the hijackers. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said that in addition to freeing <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> the terrorists wanted to gain the release of two Popular Front members jailed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after a raid in October on suspected terrorist cells in the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> areas. One of the men, <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalkamoni </PERSON>, is believed to be a ranking Popular Front official.

<HEAD>House, Senate Panels Differ on Pace of Legislation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member whose subcommittee is crafting rural development legislation says he wants to move slowly but surely, despite the desire in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to push such a measure through quickly. `` We're taking a different approach,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., whose subcommittee is holding a lengthy series of hearings before crafting legislation early this fall `` We're reaching outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' said English. `` We will have heard from over 40 witnesses by the time we finish hearings this month.'' He also has scheduled hearings in five regions of the country in August. English said the House Agriculture subcommittee on conservation, credit and rural development is moving as quickly as it can, but he does n't understand the `` push it through approach'' being taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt. and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was joined by several other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counties </ORGANIZATION> at a news conference Tuesday promoting his bill `` One of the reasons we worked so hard to get this out is so that it wo n't be perceived as a farm bill,'' said <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>. `` Ninety percent of rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is not involved in farming.'' English said that timing will determine whether the legislation is incorporated into the 1990 omnibus bill that sets farm policy for several years. `` There are some good points about that legislation -LRB- <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>'s bill -RRB-, and I think it is fine as far as it goes,'' English said `` I do n't think legislation drawn up by any one house is going to be the best approach to all the problems in rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' English said the House might pass a rural development bill by this December, but his timetable is geared for passage of a law before the session's end in December 1990. He said he expects a conference committee comprising members of both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to bring the measures together. Legislation to aid rural communities is considered necessary because steady loss of job opportunities, deteriorating roads, bridges and other infrastructure, and declining education are driving people away. But such legislation is more difficult to pass in the House than in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, because urban districts hold the majority in the House. English has warned that unless something is done to reverse the trend, cities will be greatly overburdened. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> calls his bill `` landmark legislation'' that he has waited 15 years to see passed. `` This bill has three basic purposes,'' he said. It will provide capital for new businesses in the form of revolving loans, set up satellite educational and health communication systems and provide funds for improving drinking water. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> claimed he has strong support in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> now that the interests of those seeking drought legislation have been met. A snag developed last week when Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., threatened to block the bill if the agriculture committee did n't pass his relief legislation for winter wheat farmers whose crops were destroyed by drought <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> has scheduled hearings on the drought measure next month with both it and his rural development bill to receive floor action the same day, soon after the July 4 break. Economic development officials from the rural <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> complained, however, that <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>'s bill will help rural areas with the worst economic problems. The officials questioned whether the most economically depressed rural areas will be able to use the centerpiece of the legislation _ $ 300 million to start or expand revolving loan funds _ because of its requirement that the federal aid be matched by local sources. Most poor areas ca n't afford those matching funds, they said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation on Tuesday to improve highway safety by toughening penalties for drug sales at truck stops and highway rest areas. The legislation also would prohibit trucking companies from hauling hazardous materials and bus companies from carrying passengers if they receive an `` unsatisfactory'' safety rating from the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The measure, sent to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, provides for doubling and tripling of existing penalties for crimes involving drug sales at truck stops and rest areas. It also would establish minimum jail sentences _ one year for first convictions and three years for repeat offenders. The maximum penalties will vary according to the crime a person is charged with. Supporters of the measure say they hope to reduce drug use by truck drivers. They contend that rest areas and truck stops have increasingly become markets for drug trafficking. The bill also would require the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to make random inspections of vehicles that are removed from service because of safety problems, take enforcement actions against companies for serious safety violations, and establish a regulation to improve truck braking performance. `` This is a major step to end big truck accidents that tie up major highways and claim more than 5,000 lives a year and cost the public millions of dollars,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents companies providing one-third of the insurance to the nation's commercial truckers.

 Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was found guilty Tuesday on all nine counts of lying to a federal grand jury about a money-laundering scheme, and he faces at least 10 months in prison. `` Obviously, I'm very disappointed,'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said, pledging to appeal. `` We'll be trying this case again, and, I hope, not in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.'' He insisted publicity kept him from getting a fair trial in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, a Republican, spent two terms representing the eastern suburbs before voters denied him re-election in November after his indictment. He had hoped for an acquittal and a 1990 race against Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga. But <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, 38, faces 10 months to five years in prison on each perjury count. Probation is not an option under federal sentencing guidelines, which <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> supported in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He also faces fines of up to $ 250,000 on each of the nine felony counts. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> looked on impassively as the verdict was read, his wife's hand on his back. He will be sentenced Aug. 25. He was accused of lying to a federal grand jury about his month-long 1987 negotiations with an undercover <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent, who posed as a drug-money launderer, and with a <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> supporter later convicted of money laundering. In exchange for a promissory note he held, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was seeking $ 850,000 from the agent to finish building his suburban home. The money was to be funneled to <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> through a mortgage company created by his friend and political supporter, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>. The nine counts represented nine subject areas in which <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was accused of making 20 false statements to the grand jury on Feb. 2, 1988. The jury found 18 of the statements to be deliberate, willful lies. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> dismissed a 10th count earlier. `` I could have understood one or two counts, but I just do n't understand this,'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said The jury found that he lied when he said he did n't recall being told the money included narcotics dollars, when he said he never agreed to accept the money and when he said a $ 150,000 check he received, but later returned, had nothing to do with the deal. `` To me, this is among the most important, if not the most important, case we've handled,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>. He noted that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, as a congressman, not only swore to uphold the laws but helped make them. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, a lawyer, said the trial included at least two `` very reversible errors'' which he hopes will win him a new trial: <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s dismissal of the testimony of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members have an overwhelming workload, and a prosecutor's remark concerning the possible motivation of defendants to testify during criminal trials <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> did not testify in his own defense. Neither of those two areas, however, went directly to the bulk of the evidence in the case: hours of secretly tape-recorded conversations among <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON>. In those tapes, heard by the jury, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was told the money he was seeking `` certainly'' included drug money and that he would be part of an operation to `` wash'' cash. Asked what killed <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s chances for acquittal, his lead attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>, replied, `` I imagine, the tapes.'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said later that he regrets he ever testified before the grand jury. `` Absolutely. I'd advise anybody in the future to take the Fifth,'' he said, referring to the constitutional provision against self-incrimination. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who had expressed the hope of launching a campaign against <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> following the trial, said he is now `` considering a number of different career options. One of those I've got to put into the blend is a prison ministry. `` I will go where God sends me. ... God does n't make mistakes.'' The lanky, boyish-looking <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> won his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat in a 1984 upset, in which he campaigned on favorite issues of fundamentalist Christians against Democrat <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitas </PERSON>, who is Jewish. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was defeated last November by Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a former TV actor in `` The Dukes of Hazzard.'' In his two terms, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> staunchly voted with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> right and acquired a reputation as somewhat of a gadfly, voting against such popular programs as school lunch funding and aid to African famine victims.

 Hundreds of wildcat strikers caused traffic jams to slow coal shipments Tuesday, and three union leaders were released from a two-week jail stay brought about by strike activity against mines in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` Together, we can win this strike,'' said <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, the field commander of the United Mine Workers-authorized strike by 1,900 <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> employees in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. A federal judge's June 5 decision to hold the three in jail without bond until they promised an end to the civil disobedience against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> has been a rallying point for the wildcat strikes. Those strikes, work stoppages not officially authorized by the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>, have idled about 28,000 miners in nine states. Hundreds of the wildcat strikers converged on the southwest <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> coalfields and took part Tuesday in traffic jams designed to slow <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s coal shipments. `` They've just got the place saturated with people; it's pretty well blocked up,'' said state police Lt. C.F. <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said the wildcat strikers realize that if <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> is successful in breaking away from a national contract and weakening job security and benefits, other companies may follow suit. `` They see what <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> is doing as a threat to their unions,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> is successful, it will directly affect their lives.'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stump </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>'s southwest <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> district, and C.A. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a UMW international representative, were jailed after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> found them guilty of contempt of court. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the three violated his order banning sit-down demonstrations to block coal trucks at <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s processing plants. They were freed by <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> after promising during a private hearing here Tuesday to abide by his order. The three said they purged themselves of the contempt charge because striking miners and supporters told them their leadership was needed and their testimony was needed by demonstrators arrested in sit-down protests. `` This strike is still building,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> told the crowd. He told reporters the decision to promise to comply with strike restrictions in order to get out of jail was not a surrender. `` There are no white flags in these hands. We're going to win this strike. We're not turning back,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said before holding up a bandanna printed in camouflage, the symbol of the striking miners. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, said the release of the three should bring an end to the wildcat walkouts. `` It sounds like a cause for celebration,'' <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, a field representative in the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>'s District 17, said the unauthorized strikes probably will continue as miners turn attention to the $ 3 million in fines levied against the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> by a circuit court judge in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> was proven correct when about 350 workers at two <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> mines ignored a federal judge's order to end their wildcat strike, and 350 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> refused to go back to work and walked out of a meeting with union officials The nearly 1,700 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> employees walked off their <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> jobs in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> on April 5 after working more than 14 months without a contract. The strike spread to <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> operations Monday, idling another 200 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members. The unauthorized walkouts began last week after a <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> rally in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> to protest <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to sign a nationwide contract and to protest the fines and jail terms assessed union members in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 An undercover agent for a state commission pretended to be 33 men and cast 33 ballots at 33 voting sites in the citywide local school board elections on May 2, the agent testified Tuesday. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an undercover operative for the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Integrity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION>, detailed for the commission Tuesday how easy it was to register under dozens of fake names and hop from polling place to polling place. Commission chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> emphasized that there was no evidence that fraud, outside of <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s, had occurred in the election. He also stressed that <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> filled out each of his ballots improperly, so that all his votes were invalidated and did not affect any outcome. `` We were getting a lot of information from a lot of sources indicating that these elections were open to fraud,'' <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said. `` We decided to find out if there was that kind of systemic weakness and I think we've demonstrated there is.'' `` In the old days if you wanted to engage in this kind of voter fraud, you had to go to the cemetery and take the names of the most recently deceased off of the gravestones and try to vote those folks. In this situation, all that had to be done was sit down and draw up a list of fictitious parents and children,'' <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said. Voting for school boards is open to all registered voters and to all parents of children in the schools, regardless of whether they are registered voters. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and a commission lawyer made up 84 men's names and gave each a fictitious child. A parent registration card was filled out and mailed to the Board of Election for each fake name. Seventy-three of the 84 names made the voter list of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION>; 11 registration cards evidently were lost, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. On Election Day he went to all 35 polling sites within the two districts, but voted only 33 times because his registration cards could not be found at two schools. Under state law, the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> is supposed to weed the rolls of ineligible parents and certify legitimate voters to the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Maslow </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> counsel, said the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> did little more than give blanket certification.

<HEAD>Sakharov Says Gorbachev Could Be Ousted in a Coup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said Tuesday the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is at a turning point, and if the worst happened President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could be the victim of a military coup by conservative elements. The Soviet human rights activist, in a lecture at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` The country is at the crossroads and faces major reforms. From this position the country can go either way. If it goes too far there could be a fascist military coup, especially from the right, which is the conservative element.'' He told the audience, which included representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, that the West should be cautious about overtures to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Western aid could be like pouring water into the sand and might prevent necessary reforms, he said. `` The important thing is not to undertake new initiatives,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> added. `` Wait for real change in the political system.'' He noted Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is considered a supporter of the reform-minded Soviet president. `` The caution she is observing now -LRB- toward <PERSON> Gobachev </PERSON> -RRB- is justified,'' he said. `` It does not contradict her earlier policy. It is a revision of that policy taking account of existing circumstances.'' Commenting on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he said: `` I suppose our country is now one of the last, if not the last, world colonial power. If this problem is not going to be solved in a constitutional, rational way the destruction or downfall of our country is inevitable.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, accompanied by his wife <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, is on his first trip to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner received an honorary degree at <ORGANIZATION> Sussex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on Monday and is to receive another honorary degree from <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. He will meet Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on Friday. The 68-year-old physicist was elected to the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in April, three years after he was freed from internal exile in the city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Railroad, Bus and Subway Workers Striking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> braced for transportation chaos Wednesday when a 24-hour national rail strike coincides with bus and subway strikes in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The Court of Appeal on Tuesday refused a request by British Rail to block the planned walkout by 75,000 workers. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s 10,500 subway workers decided Tuesday to go ahead with their seventh unofficial 24-hour strike this year over pay and conditions. Delegates representing 18,500 bus workers in the Transport and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> then decided on a lightning 24-hour strike to demand a 14 percent pay raise. They rejected an offer of between 8 percent and 9 percent, which <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buses </ORGANIZATION> said was `` roughly in line with inflation,'' now running at 8.3 percent. The company said a bus driver operating without a conductor earns $ 340 a week. The train stoppage will be the first national rail strike since 1982, when <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> subway workers also refused to work. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> condemned the strikers. `` It's a typically selfish policy to put themselves first before those who have to use it, deliberately causing massive inconvenience to those who have to work,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. British Rail, which says the strike will cost it $ 15.5 million, had asked the appeal judges to overrule a High Court refusal to grant an injunction requiring the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railwaymen </ORGANIZATION> to cancel the strike. The railway said the strike should not be permitted because 200 union members were not able to participate in the strike vote. Union members voted 29,675 to 20,704 to strike over <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed 7 percent wage increase and plans to abolish national wage bargaining. The Court of Appeals found no evidence that anyone entitled to vote was prevented from doing so. British Rail offered to return to the negotiating table and urged staff to ignore the strike call. `` We are looking at a pretty well total shutdown,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkinson </PERSON>, the state railroad's employee relations director. The dispute between <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Underground and 10,500 workers on the capital's sprawling subway network involves introducing trains operated only by drivers. Drivers want a $ 99 weekly increase to operate without a guard. Management is offering $ 46 plus 14 days extra annual vacation, but is tying the raise to increased productivity.

<TEXT>
 South African-led police in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> have created an atmosphere of fear and intimidation that threatens fair independence elections in the territory, a top <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said Tuesday. Police in armored cars mounted with heavy machine guns apparently have driven through villages destroying crops and terrorizing local inhabitants, according to <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s special representative in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. A feared counter-insurgency unit called `` Koevoet,'' Afrikaans for crowbar, disbanded months ago is behind the terror campaign, <PERSON> Ahtissari </PERSON> said. `` Their activities appear to have created an atmosphere of fear and intimidation among much of the population in the northern region,'' <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> reportedly wrote to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s South African administrator-general. On July 1, campaigning begins for seats in a Namibian constituent assembly that will draft a constitution and organize the territory's first black majority-ruled government The <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is expected to win the November elections, part of a U.N.-mediated peace plan. Most of <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s popular support comes from the Ovambo tribe in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, which fought a 23-year bush war against <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African rule of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, may not capture the two-thirds of the assembly seats needed to impose one-party rule. Many observers believe <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is funding political parties and using the <LOCATION> Koevoet </LOCATION> police to intimidate <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> supporters and stop the guerrillas from gaining their majority. <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> heads a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> commission monitoring <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s cooperation with a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan to free <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from 74 years of South African rule He wrote to the South African official, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, on June 9, <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Younes </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said Tuesday. He has received no reply, she said. `` The activities in which -LRB- the <LOCATION> Koevoet </LOCATION> -RRB- have been engaged render its members ... unfit for continued service in the police ... in view of the need to ensure the necessary conditions for free and fair elections,'' <PERSON> Ahtissari </PERSON> reportedly wrote.

<HEAD>AMA Agrees to Lobby Against Assault Weapons</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> agreed Tuesday to lobby for restrictions on the sale and ownership of assault weapons. After spirited debate, delegates at the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s policymaking convention adopted a resolution in support of legislation that would affect large clip, high rate-of-fire automatic and semi-automatic firearms, and any weapon that is modified or redesigned to operate in that manner. The proposal is a weaker version of a resolution debated in committee on Monday calling for a ban on the sale and private ownership of assault weapons, and does not specify the restrictions being sought. But it still sparked rousing debate as it was presented to the delegates. The measure `` disarms all of the law-abiding ... tax-paying citizens of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... and leaves us at the mercy of the crook, the dope peddler,'' said Dr. <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowda </PERSON>, a delegate from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> contends that such legislation would unfairly restrict guns commonly used by hunters, and that criminals would still have access to the weapons. But Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Zako </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> delegation, which submitted the original proposal calling for an assault weapon ban, denounced that position. `` A real sportsman who ca n't bag a deer with a slow-fire rifle ought to give up,'' he told the delegates. The measure was among a host of resolutions referred by various <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> committees to the 433 delegates. Delegates began voting on the measures Tuesday, and will conclude Thursday, the final day of the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s five-day convention. Among other action Tuesday, delegates: _ Adopted a resolution calling for model state legislation to ban the sale of alcoholic beverages at gas station convenience stores; _ Adopted a resolution calling for federal legislation to restrict the advertising and promotion of beer and other alcoholic beverages; _ Deferred action on a measure that would require food labels to list cholesterol content, caloric value and the specific source of all The delegates called for a detailed report on the measure to be submitted by the 1990 annual meeting.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered new sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Tuesday in retaliation for the government's `` wave of violence and reprisals'' against the pro-democracy movement. Prodded by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take tougher action against <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will seek to postpone consideration of new loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by international lending institutions, such as the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. One source said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s order could freeze $ 1.4 billion for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> over the next six months from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, although other estimates ranged much higher. A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member said said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had $ 4.7 billion pending at the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> alone Moreover, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials to refrain from some high-level contacts with the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government. The order does not affect routine communications between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but bars anyone of assistant secretary rank and above from taking part in exchange programs. `` This action is being taken in response to the wave of violence and reprisals by the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities against those who have called for democracy,'' White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in a written statement. Earlier Tuesday, the administration made a public plea to Chinese leaders to grant clemency to protesters sentenced to death and to pardon people arrested in pro-democracy demonstrations. The death sentences, if carried out, `` could only deepen the wounds of the past few weeks,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> directed the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday `` to deplore the death sentences handed down in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and to appeal for clemency in these cases.'' In announcing the new sanctions, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports `` the legitimate democratic aspirations for freedom of peoples throughout the world. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> will continue to voice its concern and its support for these aspirations.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` hopes that the current tragedy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> be brought to a peaceful end and that the dialogue will replace the atmosphere of suspicion and reprisal.'' `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is an important state with which we hope to continue productive relations,'' he said. The press spokesman said the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was `` of international concern as witnessed by the variety of voices that have spoken up on the issue. We urge continued international expressions of concern.'' Even as the new sanctions were announced, moves were afoot in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to prod the administration to tough action. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, introduced a resolution in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> calling on the president to direct the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> directors at the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to vote against all multilateral development loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The resolution also urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to broaden the effort by seeking the cooperation of other industrialized democracies at the economic summit next month in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` This morally bankrupt government does not deserve our support,'' <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON> said during a hearing of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> banking subcommittee, where the resolution was discussed. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, Republicans <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> criticized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as too tame. <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was `` tip-toeing through the tulip bed with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'' while <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> called the early <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reaction to suppression `` pathetically weak.'' Eleven demonstrators, denounced as `` counterrevolutionaries,'' have been sentenced to death, three in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and eight in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. More than 1,000 other people have been arrested, many of them students and young workers, as a result of pro-democracy demonstrations. `` We urge the leaders of the <LOCATION> Peoples </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to show clemency to use their powers to pardon those who were arrested in the demonstration for democracy,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> earlier in the afternoon that he had recommended to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the additional measures against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> beyond the suspension of military sales already announed. For instance, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, Secretary of Commerce <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> would cancel a trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> scheduled for July 10. Congressional Del. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-D.C. </LOCATION>, said at a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking subcommittee hearing prior to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s action that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has $ 4.7 billion in loans `` pending or in the pipeline'' at the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and $ 1.1 billion being processed by the <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> had been called to the State Department Monday evening to receive the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request for clemency made public by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday. The plea, registered by lawmakers as well, appeared to fall on deaf ears. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in a heated meeting with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was an internal matter and that foreign countries should not meddle, according to participants. More than a dozen members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> went to the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and asked that executions be blocked and that judicial decisions be reviewed. House Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., said they had `` a very frank exchange of views'' with the ambassador and `` conveyed the outrage and the deep sense of disappointment that exists among all the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people about what has transpired in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the last few days. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> raised its voice `` in the spirit of a country that has worked with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> over the past two decades to improve relations. But we believe that human rights are universal and our duty to comment on them is great.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Washington </LOCATION>, said: `` Those who have suggested that the president exercise every option and evoke every sanction against the Chinese government I think are wrong. ... these additional sanctions by the president I think will have strong support in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> moved Tuesday to begin deportation proceedings against an elderly <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> man accused of being a Nazi propagandist during World War II. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> charged <PERSON> Ferenc </PERSON> <PERSON> Koreh </PERSON>, 79, of <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, of advocating the persecution of Jews and the defeat of the Allies during World War II when he edited a newspaper in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which was an ally of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Besides editing the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Szkelely </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nep </ORGANIZATION> from 1941 through 1944, the department said <PERSON> Koreh </PERSON> was a press officer for the Hungarian Minister of Propaganda and later edited a government-run publication. Reached at his home by telephone, <PERSON> Koreh </PERSON> would say only, `` I will certainly fight it.'' In 1947, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budapest </ORGANIZATION> convicted <PERSON> Koreh </PERSON> of war crimes in connection with his editorship of the government publication, which supported the German war effort, according to the government's lawsuit.

 A leading Republican senator accused fellow <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers and conservatives Tuesday of `` downright deliberate deceit'' in attacks on a major child care package and said the Republican alternative paled in comparison. `` It's really irritating to see the misinformation and downright false information that has been spread around this body,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>. `` I get a little tired of seeing partisanship and seeing people playing with this issue,'' said <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> crossed party lines to co-sponsor the bill, which is backed mostly by Democrats. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> twice took the floor to denounce the tactics of Republicans and conservative groups, singling out the Eagle Forum for distributing `` shameful'' information he said misrepresented the child care package he supports. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>'s criticism of fellow conservatives highlighted a day that was to be spent debating an alternative child care package to be offered by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had promised to present the alternative Tuesday but did not do so. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> aides said the Republican leadership was lobbying <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators in hopes of gaining enough support for its proposal to present it on Wednesday. Democratic leaders predicted the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> effort would fail. The majority leader, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, warned senators he would delay a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> recess scheduled to begin next week if a final vote on child care is delayed past Friday. `` We're going to stay here as long as it takes,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. The only amendment considered before debate ended for the day was approved unanimously on a voice vote. It rolled back from 16 to 13 the maximum age for a child to be eligible for grant money under the program. Floor debate resumed after both parties held caucuses. During the Republican meeting, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators were given a memo attacking the Act for Better Child Care sponsored by him and Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>., D-Conn. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said the memo was full of `` downright deliberate deceit, as though that's the way it should be Later, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said the memo was not on the letterhead of any senator or group. `` I do not know who prepared this piece of junk,'' he said. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> did not refer to any of his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> colleagues by name, but many Republicans, including <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, have sharply criticized the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> and other Democrats have said many of the criticisms are not valid because the current bill has been revised substantially from <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'s original proposal. `` I regret that I have to spend time answering charges that do n't relate to this legislation,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said `` We've spent the last two days arguing about myths.'' As revised, the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill would authorize $ 1.75 billion for child care programs in fiscal 1990, with 70 percent of the money going to low-income parents to help them pay for child care. The remaining funds would go to the states for programs to improve the quality and quantity of available child care. The amended bill leaves regulatory decisions to the states; the original included federal regulations that faced staunch GOP opposition. Tacked on to the Dodd-Hatch bill were two proposals approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a new, up-to - $ 500, tax credit to help families pay for health insurance for children and a provision making refundable the existing dependent care tax credit The Republican alternative <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> planned to offer _ with the blessing of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ would rely almost entirely on tax credits to help parents pay for child care. It too would make the dependent-care credit refundable and create a new child care tax credit for low-income families with children up to 4 years old. The <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> proposal also would create a $ 400 million block grant program to help states expand child care opportunities.

 A top Republican political consultant acknowledged Tuesday he used `` influence peddling'' to steer millions of dollars in government renovation funds to a housing project that he owned in part. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, a one-time adviser to the campaigns of Presidents <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and a former business partner of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, also told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that the $ 326,000 fee his lobbying firm charged for helping to obtain the government money was the going rate for such services. The housing project in southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> late in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, was denounced as wasteful by Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and by local officials from the 7,000-person township where it is located, <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deerfiel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> said his firm was to provide public relations and lobbying services for the project. When pressed on what those services entailed, he conceded, `` I would stipulate that for the purposes of today, you could characterize this as influence peddling.'' `` I think it is a horrible waste of taxpayers' money,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, the mayor, after learning that with tax credits, rent subsidies and repair grants the project was costing the federal government about $ 43 million. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said local officials were told nothing about the project until well after the developers and their paid consultants started going after the federal money. Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., later said he believed that the project was not worthy of federal funds in the first place The housing project is a complex of 326 apartments built in the 1940s that had become dilapidated over the years. In April 1987, <ORGANIZATION> CFM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, of which <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> is one of three principal owners, bought the project for $ 4.4 million _ at least $ 1 million more than township officials said the land and buildings were worth. About a month later the state housing authority ran an advertisement announcing the availability of government funds to fix up such projects. About two weeks later, <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>'s group, the only one to apply, was awarded $ 5.5 million to fix up the buildings. In his testimony Tuesday before the housing and employment subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> repeatedly said the development company was taking risks because there was no guarantee that it would get the money from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. As proof, he cited an advertisement, which ran just once and in just one newspaper, soliciting applications from developers. `` Nobody in this world believes that you had any doubt'' the money would come through, said Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass. Holding up a copy of the advertisement, Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said, `` You could have cut out all this language and written one sentence: The fix is in.'' Subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., just read the advertisement out loud: It invited developers to apply for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funds but said the money was only for projects with more than 100 apartments and `` must be located in the city of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>. There is no such city in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> is the name of the housing project. `` This was about as phony an advertisement as you have ever seen,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said. `` This was a sham and an illusion that it was publicly advertised.'' <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> testified that before the developers bought the property his lobbying firm, <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, had already spent months contacting state and federal officials, including <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, an assistant to then-Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> is a key figure in investigations of allegations that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money to rehabilitate run-down housing for the poor and elderly was handed out to developers who hired high-priced political consultants with ties to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> or the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Earlier this month Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> appeared before the same subcommittee but refused to answer any questions on the grounds that to do so would violate her constitutional rights against self-incrimination. <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> is not the only Republican who is said to have benefited by access to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the eight years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency. Former Interior Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>, former Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and the late <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, attorney general during the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration, all made thousands of dollars by helping others get money from the department. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, a nephew of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s defense secretary, was a consultant who helped a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> housing project get funds.

 Authorities arrested more students involved in the pro-democracy movement, the government said Tuesday, and it stiffened visa requirements in what appeared to be an move to keep others from fleeing. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered new sanctions on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to retaliate for the military's crackdown on the movement this month, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> urged <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to spare the lives of the 11 demonstrators sentenced to death and to pardon all those arrested. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> maintained its surveillance of foreign journalists, and the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> government said it would lodge a formal protest after a Canadian reporter said authorities tried to abduct her. A <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student who was one of the leaders of the democracy movement was caught and returned to the capital, the official media reported. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Gang </PERSON>, 28, was apprehended Monday in <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION> province south of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, radio and televison news reports said. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> was one of 21 students on a wanted list the government issued last week. They are accused of masterminding the seven weeks of demonstrations for greater freedom and an end to official corruption. Six of those students have been arrested or have turned themselves in. Authorities say they have arrested more than 1,360 people for participating in the democracy movement. A student who was not on the wanted list was arrested and accused of `` spreading rumors'' to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government radio <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the People's Daily said Tuesday. Tens of millions of Chinese listen to the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>, a main target of criticism by the Chinese government, whicates might do if <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> carried out the executions. In a move apparently designed to tighten the dragnet around pro-democracy activists, the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government invalidated all exit permits issued before Tuesday. Chinese must obtain the permits when seeking visas to travel abroad. Chinese police guarding foreign consular offices turned away visa applicants who did not have the permits. Only three applicants who approached the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION> had obtained the permit, officials aid. Chinese who had camped outside some Western embassies for almost a week said they feared the new regulation would cause delays that might make them miss the beginning of school terms this summer and fall. Chinese authorities detained a CBS News TV crew for 2 -LCB- hours Tuesday for filming near Tiananmen Square. A CBS reporter said police confiscated the identity papers of the three crew members but later returned them and ordered the crew to obey martial law regulations that ban coverage of the democracy movement. The three left for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> later in the day, although they had not been ordered to leave, the reporter said. The government has ordered six foreign journalists to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for violating martial law regulations imposed in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on May 20. A senior <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> diplomat said he will meet with <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials Wednesday to protest what he called the `` attempted abduction'' of a Canadian newspaper correspondent. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, a Canadian-Chinese working for the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and Mail, said two men tried to force her into a car Monday evening, saying they wanted to talk to her, but they released her when she screamed and attracted a crowd. She said the men were in plain clothes and she believed they were policemen. `` We are quite disturbed about the incident and would like to have some clarification about what it means,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhavernas </PERSON>, minister-counselor at the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. State-run media continued to focus on the families of soldiers killed on the crackdown, showing the relatives meeting with senior leaders. The families of three soldiers who were beaten to death, thrown off bridges or set on fire by enraged mobs June 4 met with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xitong </PERSON> and former President <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiannen </PERSON>. In previous days, the families met with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>. The news also showed busy factories and students back at school. Workers at a major hotel and a restaurant said they were being ordered back to work on Tuesday and Wednesday, but that they were required to write reports about their activities since June 3. They said they also were ordered to devote half a day Tuesday to studying a June 9 speech by senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> calling on Chinese to unite behind the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

 Official results Tuesday confirmed that Solidarity clinched 260 of the 261 seats it was allowed to contest in the new <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, guaranteeing the union a veto over <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> legislation. But two days after Sunday's voting, politicians from both sides already were turning attention to the election of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s first president in 37 years. Results issued by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> showed Solidarity holding 99 of 100 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first democratically elected parliament chamber The independent union also gained 161 seats in the lower house, the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, compared to 299 seats held by the Communist-led coalition. That gave the Communist coalition 65 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> seats and Solidarity 35 percent, the ratio permitted under a pre-election bargain. But the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had only 173 of the coalition seats, making it technically a minority. Minor pro-government <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> groups made up the remainder of coalition places. And among the Communist coalition's seats, at least 46 were progressives endorsed by Solidarity. Several prominent hard-line Communists were defeated. `` There is hope that in the new <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> we will find partners who understand our causes and who, like us, favor the process of reform,'' Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said Tuesday. The two sides in the Assembly will be roughly balanced so that `` either there will be cooperation between the coalition and the opposition or we will face a chain of conflicts that will block the legislative process,'' said government spokesman <PERSON> Zbyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rykowski </PERSON>. In a next step, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> convenes within 30 days to choose a president. The Communist coalition enters the meeting with about 40 more votes than the opposition, although there could be defections. Choosing the president is the last stage of the political bargain struck April 5 between the Solidarity-led opposition and Communist authorities after two months of talks. The accord led to the restoration of Solidarity's legal status after a seven-year ban and the holding of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s freest parliamentary elections since World War II. The new president will sign legislation and be commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The president will serve one six-year term. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> had five presidents between 1918, when the modern Polish state was established, and 1952, when the office was abolished by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The president in turn will nominate the next prime minister, who will form a government. Although <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, who now leads the country, is assumed to be the party's candidate, his spokesman last week said he still has not decided to run.

 Scientists have discovered air pollution over much of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and it is chemically similar to the smog that plagues southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a research leader said Tuesday. <PERSON> Meinrat </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreae </PERSON>, a chemist with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Max </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said the deliberate burning of huge savanna areas produces acid rain and ozone pollution that settles over <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s rain forests `` These levels we've seen over the rain forests are dramatically higher than anything anybody has seen over rain forests before,'' <PERSON> Andreae </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Andreae </PERSON> headed the West German group in a 20-member project that included scientists from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>. He said his team spent two weeks in the field in the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> in February and March of 1988. <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s air pollution is `` a combination of atmospheric pollutants which is very similar to the sort of smog-type chemistry that you get in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Andreae </PERSON> said. `` When the smoke plume spends some time in the atmosphere and has the sunshine burning on top of it, you start photochemical reactions just like in any old smog situation in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' He said the acidity and ozone levels are similar to those in some industrialized areas of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and he noted such levels damage plants, lakes and forests. `` There is no reason ... to assume that the equatorial forests should be more resistant to these sort of pollutant impacts than those in temperate regions,'' <PERSON> Andreae </PERSON> added. He said that while the team's field work was done in the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> that country is not a source of the pollutants. The area affected by the pollution runs from the `` southern edge of the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> down to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It's a phenomenon that essentially covers all of tropical <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Any country where there are savannas there will be large-scale burning, typically once a year, sometimes every two years. All the savannas are burned periodically for agricultural purposes. The farmers like to burn the shrub and grass in order to remove the old dry grass and get the fresh grass to sprout. `` The amount of burning is increasing rather dramatically, and also the area covered by burns,'' he said. `` There are more people _ the population of all those regions is growing dramatically.'' <PERSON> Andreae </PERSON> is a director of the <ORGANIZATION> Max </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemistry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mainz </LOCATION>.

About 740 passengers and crew reached the Norwegian arctic outpost at <LOCATION> Spitsbergen </LOCATION> more than 25 hours after their ordeal began, officials said. Passengers were bused immediately to the airport on the tiny island of 1,000 people for chartered flights back to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Two Soviet planes were to collect the Soviet crew on Wednesday, said <PERSON> Harald </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersen </PERSON>, from the administrators office at <LOCATION> Spitsbergen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The Maxim Gorky was carrying 950 people when it rammed the iceberg in the foggy arctic twilight shortly after midnight, while most of the passengers were partying in a shipboard nightclub. `` Suddenly there was a terrible crash that almost shook me from my bed,'' said <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON>, 67, of <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, one of the passengers on the midnight sun cruise who was evacuated by helicopter to <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Svalbard </LOCATION> island. `` We were told to get into the lifeboats,'' <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> said. `` We sat for five hours among the icebergs. The atmosphere was calm, and the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> sailors did everything they could. They gave us vodka and whiskey in the boats, since it was cold. And blankets, too.'' The iceberg ripped two holes in the ship, which quickly took on water. Passengers said three decks became submerged. The coast guard vessel Senja, its bow reinforced for icebreaking, rushed to the area, about 300 miles east of northern <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and 180 miles west of <LOCATION> Svalbard </LOCATION> island. It reached the area about four hours later, and Norwegian officials said all passengers had been picked up about three hours later. Soviet ships steamed to the area and took over rescue operations. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the ship carried 575 passengers, all but about a dozen from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and 377 crew members. The ship set out on June 11 from <LOCATION> Bremerhaven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, sailed to <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> and struck the iceberg while sailing around the <LOCATION> Spitsbergen </LOCATION> island chain on its way to <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. The Norwegian <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> sends out weekly ice charts of the area, but the situation changes too quickly to be dependable for navigation, the Norwegian news agency reported. West German passenger <PERSON> Winfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> said there was no panic, and `` the Russian crew has worked perfectly in disembarking passengers into lifeboats, and also the Norwegians who picked us up ... have done a wonderful job.'' About 120 Soviet crewmen stayed aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Maxim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gorky </ORGANIZATION> to keep it from sinking. <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said the Soviet tugboat <PERSON> Sarja </PERSON> arrived with pumps and two more Russian vessels steamed toward the ship. `` It looks like there is enough new pumping equipment aboard to keep it afloat,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. A helicopter airlift from the Senja carried 73 of the oldest and most infirm tourists from the rescue vessel to <LOCATION> Svalbard </LOCATION> island. They were taken to a church, where <PERSON> Bjorn </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON>, a Lutheran minister, said some were in shock and resting. <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinne </PERSON>, the rescue center spokesman, said the <PERSON> Senja </PERSON> battled through ice as much as nine feet thick to reach the Maxim Gorky. The Soviet newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kornilov </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as saying there was fog when the ship hit the iceberg. `` Only the emergency team will remain on the <ORGANIZATION> Maxim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gorky </ORGANIZATION> to fight for the life of the ship. After they arrive, the Soviet rescuers must determine the character of the damage, the possibility of eliminating it, and make decisions about repair,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. The cruise ship was built in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1969 and sold to the Soviets in 1974.

 Hundreds of northern civil rights workers arrived in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> on Tuesday to relive _ for one day _ the long, hot summer of 1964. The riders, predominantly blacks, traveled 30 hours from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. They came to take part in memorial services commemorating the murders of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> on June 21, 1964. `` This state has a dark history and I wanted to see what <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> is like,'' said <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> <PERSON> Sulton </PERSON>, 76, of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation revealed <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> were killed by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> and their bodies were buried in an earthen dam near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, 40 miles north of here The murders occurred while the three volunteers were trying to keep alive a voter registration drive in neighboring <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> is located. The crime was one of the most sensational events during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The killings, and subsequent coverup by <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials, ignited indignation around the country and marked a dramatic and tragic beginning to the so-called `` Mississippi Freedom Summer Project,'' which brought young people from the North pouring into <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. Tuesday's caravan was modeled after those earlier caravans. It was scheduled to spend the night in <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION> and go on to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Wednesday for a day of ceremonies marking the 25th anniversary of the murders. <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McClain </PERSON> said his town was ready for the visitors, which were to include relatives of the victims and the governors of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` I have to admit our people have mixed emotions about this event,'' <PERSON> McClain </PERSON> said Tuesday while attending a <ORGANIZATION> Meridian </ORGANIZATION> luncheon for relatives of <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, a native son of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and former resident of <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McClain </PERSON> added he did n't expect any trouble on Wednesday but acknowledged that not everybody in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, a farming community of 7,000 residents, is happy about the memorial service. However, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON> said state officials hope to use the event to show the world that many positive changes have taken place in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> since the bloody summer of 1964. `` We intend to send a message to the nation that the only thing burning in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> today is a desire for a better life for all our people,'' <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON> said, in an oblique reference to `` Mississippi Burning,'' a recent, controversial movie about the murders. <PERSON> McClain </PERSON>, meanwhile, said he had doubts about <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s statement last weekend that he might reopen a state investigation of the 1964 murders. `` It could be a pretty rocky thing for our community,'' <PERSON> McClain </PERSON> said. `` We've come 25 years and made a lot of progress and a reopening of the murder investigation could set us back to ground zero.'' <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, brother of the slain <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, differed with <PERSON> McClain </PERSON>. `` I think it would be good to reopen the case,'' he said Tuesday. `` An investigation might help bring out some of the terrible things that happened in <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> back then, such as the beatings at the Mt. Zion Methodist Church shortly before the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> burned the church.'' Wednesday's commemoration ceremonies are set to begin at the small, predominantly black church on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The church was rebuilt the year after it was burned by the klan. On the day they were killed, <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> _ white volunteers from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area _ went with <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to visit church members and keep alive a fledgling voters registration drive in that county. They were jailed on a traffic charge and later turned over to a <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> mob which killed them and buried the bodies. The state never did bring murder charges in the case but 19 Mississipians, most from the Meridian and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> areas, were prosecuted under federal laws for violating the civil rights of the three victims. Seven men eventually were convicted and an eighth pleaded guilty. Their prison sentences ranged from three to 10 years prison but the most any ever served was six years. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representitives </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday declared Wednesday to be `` Chaney, <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and Schwerner Day'' in honor of the three victims. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed an identical resolution on June 9.

<HEAD>Subcommittee Chairmen Say Old-Growth Logging A National Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three House subcommittee chairmen warned Tuesday the fight over logging in the ancient forests of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> was more than just a regional conflict and they would keep a close watch to ensure national interests were protected. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, D-Ill., offered an amendment to the interior appropriations bill which would have forced the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to provide for cutting methods in all timber sales that would result in `` minimal fragmentation'' of remaining old-growth stands The two Northwest members of the subcommittee, Rep. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>, D-Wash., and Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, D-Ore., were caught off guard by <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>' amendment and quickly <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> agreed to withdraw the amendment, but said he might offer it again when the full committee considers the bill. `` My intent was to protect old growth to the greatest extent possible,'' <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said. `` This is a national issue.'' Meanwhile, the chairmen of two other subcommittees said during a joint hearing that they too were concerned. `` Although these forests are found primarily in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, all Americans have a stake in them,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>, chairman of the national parks and public lands subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkmer </PERSON>, D-Mo., chairman of the forests, family farms and energy subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the future of the old-growth forests presented tough policy questions for lawmakers `` It's of tremendous national concern and we need to make decisions in the best interests of all our citizens,'' said <PERSON> Volkmer </PERSON>. Both <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Volkmer </PERSON>'s subcommittee write legislation for the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, while <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>' panel provides money for the service The cathedral-like forests, with trees up to 1,000 years old, several hundred feet high and up to eight feet thick, have been the focal point of an increasingly bitter fight between environmentalists and the timber industry. Environmentalists have sought to have the spotted owl protected as an endangered or threatened species as part of their campaign to halt logging in the old-growth forests of the Northwest. The industry has claimed such protection would close vast areas of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> to logging, creating an economic catastrophe.

<HEAD>More Than 50,000 Ethnic Turks Leave Bulgaria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 50,000 ethnic Turks have poured across the border from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> since May to escape government persecution, officials said Tuesday. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Mesut </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON> on Monday took 53 ambassadors to the frontier and called for world condemnation of the <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s `` primitive'' policies He urged the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to take up the issue. <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> expected a clearer stand from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> bloc countries, particularly the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, on the problem. In 1983, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> implemented a forced assimilation campaign, under which ethnic Turks were to change their Moslem names to Christian Slavic ones. The campaign also barred the public use of the Turkish language and the practice of Islamic rites. In May, ethnic Turks demonstrated against the campaign and police attacked them with dogs and clubs, killing about 40 people. On May 26, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> began mass deportations of ethnic Turks they said were leading the protests. Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> on Tuesday reiterated his call to <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> to open negotiations on the immigration of ethnic Turks. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> says the Moslem minority numbers 780,000, while Turkish officials put it at 2.5 million in the total population of 9 million. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> has proposed talks on an immigration agreement that would allow ethnic Turks to dispose of their property and bring out liquid assets. Deportees have said they were not allowed to take with them more than a suitcase. Through defections and immigration agreements, 380,00 ethnic Turks have come to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> since 1925.

<HEAD>Arkansas Congressman Won't Run Again; Blames Coelho for Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former House Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> was `` throwing money away like crazy to get elected whip,'' leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> heavily in debt, its chairman said Tuesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> newspaper that he inherited a $ 1.4 million debt from <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, a former representative from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said he then had to borrow more money to fulfill promises <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> had made, raising the debt to $ 1.8 million. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said that was part of the reason he was not going to seek a third term as chairman of the committee, which he said <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> had turned into a political machine to which countless House Democrats were indebted. `` Everybody thought <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> was the greatest thing since sliced bread,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, also a Democrat. `` Yet I took over a committee burdened with a huge debt purely and simply because <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> was throwing money away like crazy to get elected whip. He would give members anything they wanted in return for a commitment.'' Telephone calls made by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> office were not answered Tuesday. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> became <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority whip in 1987. He resigned recently in the face of a likely ethics inquiry into his financial dealings. The committee's debt is nearly three times its reported 1987 debt. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, named committee chairman in December 1986 and re-elected without opposition in January to a second, two-year term, said he worked until September 1987 to reduce the inherited debt. `` I was n't able to start raising funds for my tenure as chairman for nine months,'' he said. `` Still, I attempted to put things in as positive a light as possible.'' The debt shot back up last fall, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said, because he had to borrow more money late in the election cycle to fulfill promises to candidates. The committee generates money for distribution to party members seeking House seats. `` This committee certainly is not in worse shape than it was when I took over,'' he said. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> also said knowledge of the debt did not hurt him in the race to succeed <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority whip. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> finished third with 30 of 261 votes cast. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said he has not talked about the debt in the past because there was `` nothing to be gained at the time by pointing fingers.'' But now that <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> is gone, `` there is no reason to keep it a big, dark secret.''

 <LOCATION> RIO </LOCATION> <LOCATION> DE </LOCATION> <LOCATION> JANEIRO </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> _ The nation's stock markets rallied Tuesday despite a financial scandal that rocked trading and forced the government's top banker to resign. Late in the day, a federal court rejected a prosecutor's request for the arrest of <PERSON> Naji </PERSON> <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON>, the super-investor blamed for upsetting the markets by bouncing $ 31 million in checks used to purchase stock futures. <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> has been barred from leaving the country. To the surprise of analysts, stock markets began to recover from a week-long tailspin that saw share prices plunge by more than 34 percent on average. The <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janeiro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> rose 10.5 percent on Tuesday, the first gain since the scandal became public June 9. The Sao Paulo market rose 15.3 percent. `` We're all perplexed by the rise. It's possible that the market was so low that any trading at all would seem like a big jump,'' said <PERSON> Kleber </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulistano </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The commission is roughly equivalent to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, the capital, President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> planned to appoint a replacement for <PERSON> Elmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Camoes </PERSON>, who quit Monday as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s equivalent of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Camoes </PERSON> was forced to resign when the stock brokerage run by his son was involved in the scandal because of speculation by <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ximenes </PERSON>, the No. 2 official at the finance ministry and a long-time bank functionary, was expected to replace <PERSON> Camoes </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Murilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murca </PERSON> said. The center of the furor is <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON>, a 42-year-old multimillionaire businessman and the No. 1 investor in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s $ 30 billion stock market. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> bounced checks worth $ 31 million to several brokerages for the purchase of stock futures. The commission said <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> had borrowed heavily to invest in blue-chip stocks, taking advantage of a rule that allowed him to pay five days later. Meanwhile, he pumped up the stock's price by buying large amounts of common stock, so the shares he received later were worth more, it said. But when banks restricted credit for that type of operation, <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON>' checks to several brokerages were returned for lack of funds. One of the brokerages was <LOCATION> Capitanea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Distribuidora </LOCATION>, 99 percent owned by <PERSON> Camoes </PERSON>. `` Capitanea has a large debt with <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON>. And since he's not paying his debts, there's a risk the government will have to close down the brokerage,'' said <PERSON> Paulistano </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` Because he was such a big investor, brokerage houses allowed him to run up big debts. Now all the brokerages that dealt with <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> are in trouble,'' <PERSON> Paulistano </PERSON> said. He said 29 brokerages were under investigation for irregularities. `` This is just the tip of the iceberg. He has lots of financial obligations that will be difficult to honor,'' <PERSON> Paulistano </PERSON> said. On June 12, the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> declared a one-day stock market holiday to prevent panic among investors. <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janeiro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcellos </PERSON> sought federal help, but the government refused to bail out the brokerages or the Rio Exchange. On Saturday, <PERSON> Barcellos </PERSON> announced he was taking a leave of absence indefinitely from the presidency of the <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has barred <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> from leaving the country. In <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s financial center, Judge <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocha </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattos </PERSON> of the 12th <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Tuesday that <PERSON> Najas </PERSON> could not be arrested because there was not sufficient evidence to show he was responsible for stock manipulation. In his 11-page decision, Judge <PERSON> Mattos </PERSON> added <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> had made it clear he would cooperate with law officials and not leave the country. Federal District Attorney <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bueno </PERSON> had requested preventive detention of <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON>, a Lebanese immigrant whose business interests range from mining and farming to real estate and insurance, is a common sight in Brazilian society pages. In 1984 he hosted <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> arms merchant <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> on a visit to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, when he met with then-President Gen. <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueiredo </PERSON>. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also has linked <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> billionaires <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> in their ill-fated try to corner the world's silver bullion market <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Murilo </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> <PERSON> Freire </PERSON>, said Tuesday that one of <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON>' investment companies filed for protection from creditors. The company, <ORGANIZATION> Selecta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comercio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> e </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, was one of several firms owned by <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> that operated on the stock market and was the hardest hit by the crash.

 Mix <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> with <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and a bit of <PERSON> Jule </PERSON> <PERSON> Styne </PERSON>, and you'll get `` The Loman Family Picnic'' by <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Margulies </PERSON>. This odd yet imaginative domestic free-for-all, which opened Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'s Stage II, keeps the audience off-balance for most of the evening as the story switches from low comedy to high drama to hard-sell musical comedy. The changes of gear could be unsettling, but the playwright and director <PERSON> Barnet </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellman </PERSON> manage to keep everything spinning for much of the time. `` On the day I was married, the world showed every sign of coming to an end,'' says the play's 38-year-old heroine, <PERSON> Doris </PERSON>. It did n't _ and neither did her marriage to a drab lighting fixture salesman named <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON>. Instead, their lives in a middle-class <LOCATION> Coney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> apartment building just went on and on. The years were highlighted by the arrival of two sons, <PERSON> Stewie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. The play, set in 1965, turns on <PERSON> Stewie </PERSON>'s bar mitzvah, and all the problems and pressures it produces. Like <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Loman </PERSON> in <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s `` Death of a Salesman,'' <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> dreams of a better life and actually believes she has found one with <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON>. And like <PERSON> Willy </PERSON>, who idolized his successful and adventurous Uncle <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> adores her late and lamented <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> who died at age 23. The ghost of Uncle <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> hovers over <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s classic <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON>, a tough-talking, sexy young woman, does the same in `` The Loman Family Picnic.'' <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> do n't really talk. <PERSON> Margulies </PERSON>' dialogue between husband and wife is a model of non-communication. They do n't say what's on their minds until it is too late. The wife focuses her attention on her sons _ the older <PERSON> Stewie </PERSON>, played with authentic obnoxiousness by <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Trichter </PERSON>, and the more artistic and sensitive <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, portrayed with charm and grace by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Miceli </PERSON>. Instead of a writing a book report on `` Death of a Salesman,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> creates a mini-musical comedy. He calls it `` Willy!'' and it bursts upon the stage late in Act 2 after the family has had a major blow-up over the bar mitzvah. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s music for `` Willy!'' is by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shire </PERSON>, composer of `` Baby'' and `` Starting Here, Starting Now.'' It has the brassy, uptempo sound of a Styne show, a style totally at odds with the humdrum happenings on stage. But that's the point of <PERSON> Margulies </PERSON>' family tale The playwright even adds several alternate endings to the play, imagining what the characters would like to happen and what really does. It's funny and a bit sad at the same time. <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> gives a marvelously funny and touching performance as the mother. <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> refuses to give up or grow old. Dressed as the Bride of Frankenstein, she goes trick or treating with her sons on Halloween and cuts up her wedding dress for a costume. She keeps repeating, `` I love my life, I love my life, I love my life,'' and you believe her. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s most underrated character actors, excels as <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON>. He's a superb physical comedian and a master of timing. Watch him as he forces himself to eat the diet tuna plate <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> prepares each evening for him. <PERSON> Kellman </PERSON> has a difficult job separating the fantasies from real life but with the help of the imaginative lighting by <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kletter </PERSON> and his hardy troupe of actors, he does just that. Out the living room window looms a non-descript apartment building, much like the high-rises that hem in the <PERSON> Loman </PERSON> home in <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s play. Designer G.W. <PERSON> Mercier </PERSON> has an eye for detail, down to the family's hideous <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> furniture and shag carpeting that covers the tiny stage. `` The Loman Family Picnic'' is an unusual play. It echoes <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Styne </PERSON>, but it can stand on its own as an original piece of theater.

 A father and son surrendered Tuesday on charges of defrauding the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by using lower-quality scrap metal in engine parts built into thousands of military aircraft and tanks. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, 63, and <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 40, of the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> area, both former presidents and general managers of <ORGANIZATION> Aerodyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Castings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, were indicted Monday. Also indicted was <PERSON> Carman </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, 55, a former chief engineer from <ORGANIZATION> Converse </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. The Bakers surrendered in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> and were released on $ 100,000 bail. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> was to surrender in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosso </PERSON>. No court date was set. The federal indictment charges them with plotting to defraud the government by using less expensive scrap instead of pure metal for military aircraft and M-1 <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> tank parts, then certifying that tests showed the parts met specifications for pure alloys. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> were charged with lying to the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> about test results for turbine blade parts and trying to hide the fact that the blades did n't meet contract specifications. The government said the two falsely identified failing results on lab reports as non-valid and omitted failed test results on certifications to the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> also was charged with obstructing justice for allegedly approving a report for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> that contained false and misleading information. The blades manufactured during a 7-year period are used on more than 22,000 aircraft, including F-16 jets, as well as helicopters and tanks. `` There also appears to be danger to personnel which is not being adequately addressed by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>,'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., told ABC News `` I describe the military response to this problem as being seriously inadequate, callous and probably seriously indifferent.'' If convicted, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> faces up to 40 years in prison and $ 1.5 million in fines; the elder <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> faces 20 years and $ 520,000, and his son 45 years and $ 1.7 million. The Bakers, along with another of the elder <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s sons, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>, 35, were also indicted in April on 11 counts of fraud, conspiracy, money laundering and theft against <ORGANIZATION> Aerodyne </ORGANIZATION>. They have pleaded innocent to the charges against the company. No trial date has been set in that case but is expected sometime in July.

 A wildfire apparently started by target shooters raged through <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> brush Tuesday, roaring to within 1,000 feet of a desert neighborhood where 85 homes were abandoned by fleeing residents. The 600-acre blaze, one of several brush fires in <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> counties, was driven by 45 mph winds and fed on dense, brittle vegetation as temperatures soared into the 100s. Firefighters were managing to keep the flames away from the <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> homes late Tuesday. No injuries were reported and no houses were damaged, said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION>. `` The fire was running in really close.

<HEAD>Four Arrested in Baby-Selling Scheme</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four people, including a father-and-daughter attorney team, were arrested Tuesday for allegedly bilking desperate couples of $ 500,000 in a baby-selling scheme that spanned 21 states and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The group `` preyed upon the emotions of these couples'' and `` in effect, engaged in a black market baby-selling operation,'' said state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>. The four were named in 144-count indictment alleging they arranged illegal adoptions for about 100 couples from around the country. Fifty couples wound up with the infants between 1983 and 1988, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. An investigation disclosed that the defendants enticed prospective parents into paying extra fees and supposed expenses of the birth mothers, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. Some prospective parents paid up to $ 16,000 and did not receive a child or receive their money back, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. The couples were told the birth mothers had miscarried or changed their minds. The babies were found primarily through advertisements placed in a supermarket checkout counter tabloid, and the couples who wanted babies were found through word of mouth, officials said. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said neither the mothers who gave up their children nor the parents who adopted the infants face any charges. The four were charged with grand larceny, conspiracy, fraud, perjury, filing false documents and making false statements. The charges stem from the illegal operation of Child Haven of <LOCATION> Northeastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, a private adoption agency. They pleaded innocent before <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkman </PERSON>. The most serious charge carries a maximum of seven years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine or double the amount illegally gained. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said he also would seek restitution. Arrested were attorney <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenichel </PERSON>, 65; his daughter, attorney <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenichel </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, 35; <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauer </PERSON>, 46; and her husband, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, 53; all of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The elder <PERSON> Fenichel </PERSON> was released on $ 100,000 personal security bond. His daughter was released on $ 2,500 bail. The Lauers were released when they promised to pay $ 10,000 bail within two weeks.

 After years of sitting back and waiting for 90 percent of the television audience to automatically tune in to their new fall shows, the networks have had a rude awakening. The audiences, faced with an ever-increasing number of entertainment choices, are n't automatically tuning in. The networks now have to work to win them over, and that has spawned an unprecedented burst of promotional innovation for the 1989-90 season. Come fall, folks stopping in for a pizza will also receive an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> promo tape. Shoppers can buy a blank Scotch videotape and get an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> featurette, visit K mart and be greeted by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> displays, go to a movie and see a commercial for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. Demonstrator television sets in <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> stores will be tuned to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, and Maxell tape packages will include pitches for CBS. Last season, the three-network share of the television audience dropped to 67 percent, from 71 percent the previous season. Those <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> figures reflect inroads by cable, independent channels and videocassette rentals in the last decade that have eroded the networks' traditional combined share that ranged up to 90 percent in the 1970s. This summer and fall, the networks' promotional ploys range from look-alike `` news'' reports on upcoming shows to marketing tie-ins with retail outlets and videotape manufacturers _ on the assumption that viewers will buy the tapes to record the network's shows. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakarin </PERSON>, vice president for marketing for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, calls the new network strategy `` guerrilla marketing.'' `` These used to be easy jobs,'' he said. `` Used to be all you had to do was do your own on-air advertising and plunk an ad in TV Guide a couple of times. `` As our audience fragments,'' said <PERSON> Zakarin </PERSON>, `` we got ta go out and find them wherever they are.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> plans to take out ads in TV Guide again this fall _ with a difference. During the month of November _ when important local affiliate ratings are measured _ <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s ads will include bar codes, similar to product price codes. The codes can be read by programming `` wands'' included with some <ORGANIZATION> Panasonic </ORGANIZATION> videocassette recorders. Run the wand over the bar code in the ad for, say, `` thirtysomething,'' and the machine is programmed to record it. ABC figures there are 800,000 such VCRs in viewers' homes. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> previously announced a promotional partnership with <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> followed suit with <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> is still looking for a retail partner, but has other promotional plans, including the first-ever network commercial in movie theaters _ a 60-second promo for its fall lineup that will begin running in 5,000 theaters in August <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> plans to run on its own airwaves `` CBS Spotlites,'' advertisements designed to resemble news breaks, that feature reports on stars of upcoming CBS shows. All three networks have cross-promotions involving videotapes. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> has joined <ORGANIZATION> Maxell </ORGANIZATION> in a marketing strategy that will include a plug for <ORGANIZATION> Maxell </ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' fall print advertising. A circular promoting <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> shows will be included in Maxell videotape packages. `` This is our way of pointing out to viewers that they need not miss any <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> programs _ they can tape them on Maxell,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Schweitzer </PERSON>. But purchasers of 3M-Scotch videotapes will get a pitch to record <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> shows. Purchasers of five-packs of Scotch videocassettes will receive a one-hour, NBC-produced promotional video, `` Behind the Scenes at <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Favorite Network.'' A coupon in single-cassette packages will offer the video for $ 5.95. Scotch packages will also include a printed insert promoting <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s fall schedule. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> is participating in a promotional video distribution that also involves <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> and Paramount productions. One million promotional videos will be handed out to Pizza Hut customers. CBS and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s retailer tie-ins, meanwhile, involve cross-promotion in print and television ads, plus in-store displays enticing shoppers to enter contests with prizes of cars, video equipment, vacations _ even, in <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s case, a guest shot on a prime-time show. Stay tuned. Come the fall, the networks will find out if anyone's buying

<HEAD>The Terrors of A Modern Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the 20 months since the stock market crash of October 1987 the American economy and the workers, investors, managers and others who contribute to it have been repeatedly terrorized. No individual will admit to being the terrorist, and no culprit has been jailed, but there has indeed been a reign of terror. As one threat passes, another takes its place. Always a test, never a rest. The first of the threats flashed across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> within minutes of the crash. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, it was said, was about to plunge into recession. Not just an ordinary one, but something that would make the 1930s seem like boom times. It sounded convincing. A trillion dollars or more of value can not disappear without repercussions; consumers, who make up two-thirds of the economy, will be unable to buy; producers without buyers will be forced to shut down. Learned journals prepared articles on the amazing similarities between 1987 and 1929. Popular essays spread and enforced the gloom. Prophets orated from the mountaintops. Seers claimed to have looked into the pit. Time passed, and people adjusted to fear. They conceded that judgment day might be postponed, but in the meantime there would be terrible times. The economy would overheat! Interest rates would rise! Inflation was on the way! That threat seemed good for a few months; there was enough supporting evidence to convince the `` experts'' that this time they were onto something substantial. Inflation now, they said, and then the economic crash. Whether it was through the intervention of divine power or the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, or because the threat was n't real to begin with, the economy escaped the wild inflation that had been foreseen. And maybe even the crash. Whatever, the old fear eroded into a new thesis: This economy has some guts after all, it was said. We will have a soft landing; the economy will parachute back to reality rather than crash in ruins. It could not be, said others. When has an economy that has risen for so many months with so many aberrations _ the federal deficit and the imbalance of international payments, for example _ come down to a soft landing? Soft landings, it was said by erudite ecomomic watchers, are for astronauts, not economies. Space ships are controlled vehicles, economies are nothing but meteors racing through space under no human control whatever. Meanwhile, another threat emerged: Stagflation. If by chance the economy came down like a feather instead of a rock it would n't be able to rise again. It would stagflate; prices would rise, but jobs and payrolls would shrink. So accustomed were people to threats that they almost failed to observe that one by one the threats were evaporating like steam on a dry day. A fragile thread of optimism even wove its way through the economy. The economy, it was said, is reaccelerating. Reaccelerate? When? You mean, grow again? Impossible! Why we have n't had our great recession yet. Punishment first, and then acceleration, perhaps, but not before. Terrorism in pursuit of goals generally ignores everything, including the facts, but it also seizes opportunity. And if the reacceleration theory had to be accepted by the terrorists then they would make use of it. They are reminding us now that the economy is cyclical, that ups are followed by downs, and that whenever the economy accelerates it is heading for a fall.

 `` Am I only fourteen? Am I really still a silly little schoolgirl? Am I really so inexperienced about everything? I have more experience than most; I have been through things that hardly anyone of age has undergone.'' _ <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, April 28, 1944.

 <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> turned 13 on June 12, 1942. She received a blue blouse, roses, a bottle of slightly fermented grape juice, a party game, a plant, a dish of sticky molasses, a bowl of truffles and a homemade strawberry tart. She was also given a squarish book, commonly used to collect autographs, with a red and white checked cover. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> began keeping a diary. What began as an adolescent's longing for self-knowledge evolved into a lasting document about the destruction of human life, the tragic loss of innocence and unfathomable hatred of the Holocaust. Forced into hiding by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> chronicled her days with uncommon humor, perceptiveness and faith in the goodness of people. `` The Diary of <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'' stands as a moving, tangible document, and has sold millions of copies around the world. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> died at the <LOCATION> Bergen-Belsen </LOCATION> concentration camp in 1945, and would have been 60 this year. A critical edition of her diary has been released in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Doubleday </PERSON>. A popular student at a Jewish school in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> was a pretty, dark-haired girl, outspoken in class and admired by many boys. Yet the diary would prove to be her most cherished friend.

 `` I have darling parents and a sister -LRB- <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> -RRB- of 16. I know about 30 people whom one might call friends _ I have strings of boy friends, anxious to catch a glimpse of me and who, failing that, peep at me through mirrors in class. I have relations, aunts and uncles, who are darlings too, a good home, no _ I do n't seem to lack anything. `` But it's the same with all my friends, just fun and joking, nothing more. ... We do n't seem to be able to get any closer... Perhaps I lack confidence, but anyway, there it is, a stubborn fact and I do n't seem to be able to do anything about it.''

 While hiding from the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> was transformed from a playful girl of 13 to an insightful, compassionate, even spiritual 15-year-old. On Jan. 6, 1944, she recalled a dream about a boy from school: `` I awoke at this point, while I could still feel his cheek against mine and felt his brown eyes looking deep into my heart, so deep, that here he read how much I loved him and how much I still love him. Tears sprang into my eyes once more, and I was very sad that I had lost him again. ...'' In another dream, she saw her late grandmother and a friend from school. `` ... Granny appeared as a guardian angel; then followed <PERSON> Hanneli </PERSON>, who seems to be a symbol to me of all the sufferings of all my girlfriends and all Jews. When I pray for her, I pray for all Jews and all those in need. ...'' Prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Netherlands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> for War Documentation, the book includes essays on the Franks before and after they went into hiding, the events surrounding their capture, and how the diary reached publication. The new edition contains three versions of the diary: <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s first and second drafts, and the original published work, which combines the two But commemorating her birth was not the only reason for the reissue. The book also offers a strong rebuttal to accusations made over the years that the diary was fake, a shameless exploitation. In the late 1950s, right-wing newspapers in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> published attacks on the diary, insisting the ideas expressed were far too sophisticated for a teen-age girl. In the mid -'70s, a German publishing house began distributing pamphlets repeating charges that <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s father, had written the diary with the help of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Upon <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s death in 1980, the original manuscripts were turned over to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> war documentation institute; work on the critical edition began the following year. One of the book's editors, <PERSON> Gerrold </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroom </PERSON>, insisted in a recent interview that the diary is indeed authentic `` We asked the Dutch forensic laboratory of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, which does the same work for police, to check the paper and ink. They found that all the paper and all the ink, were very common for the first half of the 1940s,'' he said. `` They also compared the letters before the war, postcards, etc., that she had written to her grandmother in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, with the handwriting in the diaries. They found that the same person wrote everything.'' The <PERSON> Franks </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, until 1933 when they emigrated to <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> took power. The Nazis occupied the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> in 1940, and began imposing ever harsher anti-Jewish laws, forcing Jews to wear a yellow six-pointed star. When the SS, the Nazi military police, issued a call-up notice to <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> in July 1942, the family was forced into hiding. For more than two years, the <PERSON> Franks </PERSON> and four others were holed up in a `` Secret Annexe,'' located upstairs from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s warehouse in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. They relied on friends, notably <PERSON> Miep </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gies </PERSON>, to bring them food and supplies, and prayed that the Allied troops would liberate their country before the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> could find them. Police raided the annex on Aug. 4, 1944, and the prisoners were sent off to <LOCATION> Westerbork </LOCATION>, a Jewish transit camp. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and her sister, <PERSON> Margot </PERSON>, were later shipped to the notorious death camp, <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, and eventually to <LOCATION> Bergen-Belsen </LOCATION>, where they contracted typhoid fever and perished within days of each other in the winter of 1945. Their mother died at another camp. After the arrest, <PERSON> Miep </PERSON> <PERSON> Gies </PERSON> gathered up <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s papers and kept them under lock and key. When <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> in June 1945, he headed straight for the Gies home and was presented with his daughter's journals.

 `` I see the eight of us with our ` Secret Annexe' as if we were a little piece of blue heaven, surrounded by heavy black rain clouds,'' <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> wrote on Nov. 8, 1943. `` The round, clearly defined spot where we stand is safe, but the clouds gather more closely about us and the circle which separates us from the approaching danger closes more and more tightly.''

 In 1947, a Dutch edition of the diary was published to overwhelming acclaim.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> was alarmed when he found his sons sniffing green rocks that kids carried away from the municipal dump. Fourteen-year-old <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> and 18-year-old <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> lurched and stumbled in the unpaved streets, occasionally pulling a sock out of a pocket and sniffing it. The socks held a bright green, rocky substance that smelled like airplane glue or spray paint. When crushed and sniffed, it gave the same cheap highs. The rocks surfaced in March and quickly became the drug of choice around the vast dump, an area where the well-off live in cinderblock houses and others make do with cardboard huts. Young children flocked to it, according to dozens of worried parents interviewed by <PERSON> Juarez </PERSON> newspapers. `` It makes people stupid and aggressive _ more aggressive than a drunk,'' said the <PERSON> Campos </PERSON>, whose sons shoved and hit him when he confronted them. They `` would lie on the couch and would n't get up.'' The green rocks proved to be toxic waste dumped by a `` maquiladora,'' one of 275 U.S.-owned factories located in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION> to take advantage of cheap labor. Mexican environmental suspect maquiladoras improperly dispose of half their hazardous waste. That would be hundreds of tons a year in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION> alone. The officials in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION> say they have gotten rid of the green rocks and cracked down on toxic wastes at the dump, but gangs of toughs known as `` cholos'' still collect and sell intoxicating substances. <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> did n't know any of that in late March when he took some of the rocks to a reform school principal. She did n't know what they were. About the same time, a woman walked into the <ORGANIZATION> Centro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Integracion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juvenil </ORGANIZATION>, a drug treatment center for children, and told psychologist <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bueno </PERSON> that her 10-year-old son was sniffing green rocks. `` She said that at the dump, there were lots of other children who used this.'' <PERSON> Bueno </PERSON>, who estimates that about 200 children experimented with the substance, sent it to the Secretariat Urban Development and Ecology, or SEDUE _ the beleaguered equivalent of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. SEDUE identified it as solidified <PERSON> Kaltex </PERSON>, an industrial solvent containing toluene, a petroleum derivative that can cause lung damage. A doctor told <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> him the <PERSON> Kaltex </PERSON> did more than that to his sons. `` When they get married, they ca n't have children,'' <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> said. Infertility is one possible side effect when adolescents use inhalants like toluene, said Dr. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrasco </PERSON> of the La Fe family clinic in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, where inhalant abuse is widespread. If users do n't become infertile, their children are likely to be deformed. Inhalants harm the liver and kidneys and can cause organic brain syndrome _ characterized by loss of coordination, irritability, chronic confusion and nerve injury, <PERSON> Carrasco </PERSON> said. And they can destroy tear ducts. `` After a while, they ca n't even cry, and they're subject to eye infections,'' he said. `` I think inhalant abuse is one of the worst _ and it's one of the most available for young kids.'' Parents reported seeing cholos jumping onto trucks turning off Avenue of the <LOCATION> Aztecs </LOCATION> onto the dirt road leading to the dump. The cholos would toss five -, 10 - and 20-gallon plastic buckets of waste off to When SEDUE officials inspected the dump April 6, they found dozens of buckets of <LOCATION> Kaltex </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Campos </PERSON>, who kept several chunks of <LOCATION> Kaltex </LOCATION> as souvenirs, said a piece the size of his foot goes for 10,000 pesos _ about $ 4.35. In late April, SEDUE traced the Kaltex to <ORGANIZATION> Outboard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>, which makes parts for <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Evinrude </ORGANIZATION> outboard boat engines. Officials at the <LOCATION> Waukegan </LOCATION>, Wis.-based manufacturer referred all questions to <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Anklam </PERSON>, manufacturing engineer in the Juarez plant. <PERSON> Anklam </PERSON> said news reports about the solvent residue had been greatly exaggerated and that representatives from the factory and SEDUE scoured the dump in late April and found three five-gallon plastic buckets that had originated at <ORGANIZATION> Outboard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>, called Omex for short. `` Omex accepts the possibility that the three pails ... could have been dumped by accident at the Juarez landfill. It was just a human error, if in fact it is ours. A lot of companies use similar materials around here,'' said <PERSON> Anklam </PERSON>, adding that Omex is cooperating with SEDUE and acting legally. Mexican law requires hazardous waste from maquiladoras to be returned to their place of origin, usually the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law requires companies returning hazardous waste to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to notify the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which shares information with the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Meacham </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said tracking waste through paperwork is time-consuming _ and even if the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> had no record of a company returning waste to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it would n't mean much. `` If the wastes are from raw materials from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, they can be disposed of in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Or if it's recyclable, it can be recycled in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Or they can store their waste on-site in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> indefinitely.'' <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuela </PERSON> <PERSON> Salas </PERSON>, chief of <ORGANIZATION> SEDUE </ORGANIZATION>'s office in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, said Omex is complying with Mexican law. She referred all other questions to <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, communications chief for SEDUE. <PERSON> James </PERSON> did not return numerous calls to his home and office from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Salas </PERSON> told the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juarez </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Omex </PERSON> was the first maquiladora to be caught throwing toxic waste into the Juarez dump. `` To ensure this does n't happen again, we're giving an identification number to each business that generates waste, to make it easier to watch them.'' But it is difficult for SEDUE to keep watch. The agency has 10 inspectors in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION> to monitor 275 maquiladoras and at least 100 Mexican-owned factories. Faced with a crushing national debt, a severe housing shortage and a population boom that adds 1 million people to the work force a year, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s government has not been able to make environmental protection a high priority. So far, <ORGANIZATION> SEDUE </ORGANIZATION>'s plan does n't seem to be working. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, the dump's foreman, said he does n't know what's in the scores of trucks that deposit waste in the landfill daily. Neither do the drivers, he said. But the cholos seem to know. They still wait at the corner where trucks turn to go to the dump. They still jump on, and they still toss buckets off the speeding trucks for collection later. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> takes part. `` There are 10 other kinds of intoxicants there,'' <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> said. `` Paint, adhesive ...'' He shrugged helplessly, lowered his gaze, and sighed.

It's good stuff for a family Saturday night viewing, but you might need a bit of parental guidance for the younger set. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> stars as the would-be baseball hero and <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> as a free spirit who commits suicide. She was his baby sitter as a child and sometime lover as a young adult. But there are two major problems with the film. The first is that <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>'s character, <PERSON> Katy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, never really gets a chance to develop. We see far too little of her in the movie to really understand her motivation and direction or to explain her suicide. The other problem is the overwhelming use of flashbacks. The whole thing is a flashback, with flashbacks inside the flashback, which really jumbles the timing. The story unwinds through <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, who daydreams as he sits on a minor league bench. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, as <PERSON> Billy </PERSON>, the charming all-American kid, does a neat job of coming back from a ne'er - do-well to cleancut baseball player after he returns home to dispose of <PERSON> Katy </PERSON>'s The daydream proceeds through the odyssey of growing up and, of course, the greatest of all youthful experiences _ stealing home from third base. _ By <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer

But you see, I ai n't got no choice. ... I ca n't walk in flats.

But <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckoff </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Fierstein </PERSON> -RRB- persists, and his joys and sorrows make a funny and moving film, adapted from the Broadway play for which <PERSON> Fierstein </PERSON> received acting and writing Tony awards.

 `` Daffy Duck's Quackbusters'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>. VHS-Beta, $ 19.98. -RRB- Adult Merrie Melodies mavens will be disappointed by `` Daffy Duck's Quackbusters,'' a newly animated feature-length video that strings together snippets of old Daffy classics with newer material meant to be a send-up of `` Ghostbusters.'' This formula is already familiar on television, as Bugs Bunny Christmas or Thanksgiving shows or the like. But the sad result is that you have cartoon classics, with their sophisticated wit and superior animation and voice characterization, patched together by fair-to-middling new animation. The satiric bite that made <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> cartoons fun for all ages is now largely missing. `` Daffy Duck's Quackbusters'' is OK for the kids, but for adults there are certainly better video anthologies around. Even more sadly, what everyone will notice is that <PERSON> Daffy </PERSON> just does n't sound like his zany self. Nor do the other characters like <PERSON> Porky </PERSON> and Bugs. The great <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON>, who has been the voice of nearly all the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> cartoon characters for some 50 years, is now 80. Unfortunately, this 1980s vintage <PERSON> Daffy </PERSON> seems like the pug who did n't know when to hang up the gloves.

 `` Flowers in the Dirt'' -LRB- Capitol -RRB- _ <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>'s `` Flowers in the Dirt'' contains some of his best work in more than 15 years, although it falls naggingly short of being an unqualified success. Spurred by ex-mate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s triumphant comeback and his own flagging reputation, <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> pulled out all stops to show he's no fool over the hill The single `` My Brave Face,'' co-written with <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, is easily <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>'s best tune of the 1980s. It's a bracing melody about the sudden onset of bachelorhood, where it quickly becomes clear that the narrator's joy over new-found freedom is only a facade for a sense of loss. The tune is, yes, Beatlesque, but is odd enough to be distinctive. `` This One,'' a gentle melody about finding the right time to tell someone you love them, and `` We Got Married'' are typical of <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>'s sweet side. This time, though, they're not sickly sweet. The heavily produced `` Rough Ride'' also works well. <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> pokes fun at his image with `` You Want Her Too,'' a biting duet with Costello that's the antithesis of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s cloying `` The Girl Is Mine'' with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The comparison with <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>'s duets with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> is also obvious. Costello helps, but <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> seems driven to abandon his insipid lyrics for adult themes. `` We Got Married'' looks at the institution several years removed from the initial excitement, while `` Distractions'' shows how other forces impinge on happiness. That's a good head start for a solid album. But then <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> makes a few strategic errors. Songs such as `` Motor of Love'' and `` How Many People'' are the type of innocuous filler that all but the truly classic albums contain. But <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> stretches these songs to stupefying lengths _ more than six minutes for `` Motor'' _ turning them into unpleasant experiences. It's a surprising lack of discipline for someone who should know better. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> also spoils `` Do n't Be Careless Love'' by stretching his voice to unreasonably high levels. Still, this is far richer album than any by <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> since `` Band on the Run'' back in 1973. It's good to have him back. _ By <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer

 Keyboard Sonatas by <PERSON> Domenico </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarlatti </PERSON> -LRB- <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Andras </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, piano. <PERSON> Scarlatti </PERSON> was born in one of music's all-time great years: 1685, when <PERSON> Bach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> also joined the world. In 1729, the Italian <PERSON> Scarlatti </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and spent the rest of his life working for the royal court there. It was mainly during those years that he wrote his 555 keyboard sonatas. What an abundance of music. Imagine, you could listen to one a day for 18 months, or <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> could issue another 40 CDs of Scarlatti sonatas. These mostly one-movement pieces are gems. Typically, what makes them so unique are particular transcendant moments _ a chord here, a two-bar phrase there, even a simple grace note. It is music of color: strumming guitars, bagpipe drones, clicking castanets. Such a quality makes these sonatas particularly apt for piano, rather than their original harpsichord medium. <PERSON> Andras </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> uses the instrument to add color, yet keeps a light harpsichord quality that does n't turn the music into 19th century romance. His technically superb playing is clear, but not luminous. In the more reflective sonatas, it becomes even a little bland. He does better in the livelier selections. <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> holds the music up for your contemplation rather than drawing you in. The choice of 15 sonatas is good, and generous at 73 minutes, 14 seconds. _ By <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

In April, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s management proposed a plan to rebuild as a carrier about two-thirds its original size and to sell about $ 1.8 billion in assets to pay off debts.

 Despite its recent loss of influence, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> will become a more important source of the world's oil in the 1990s, its secretary general says. In a speech to a group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil producers, <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said Monday he thinks the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> will satisfy up to half of the world's oil demand in the next five years, up from about 40 percent today. `` In <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, we see the projected increase in our market share as leading to the restoration of the influence which is our due,'' <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said. Conversely, he said, he expects oil production in non-OPEC countries to fall by about 1 million barrels per day from present levels during the first half of the 1990s. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said no major oil discoveries have been made in non-OPEC areas and production could drop even more with accidents due to aging production facilities in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. `` With about 84 percent of the world's total reserves, our member countries are well placed to support the expansion in world oil demand projected for the early 1990s,'' he said. He added that the 13 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations are striving for a stable oil market and he foresees no drastic price hikes over the next five years. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> predicted `` only moderate increases in real oil prices'' over the period, but said <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s future market behavior will depend on a variety of factors, including cooperation from independent oil producers. He made his remarks to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Compact </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which represents <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil producers. The commission's semi-annual gathering will be held through Wednesday Its chairman is <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>, who gave an overview Monday of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> and its cleanu-up efforts. <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said the spill pointed out the need for more environmental safeguards but warned they would drive up oil production costs.

<HEAD>Fed Gives Morgan Subsidiary Permission to Underwrite Corporate Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has given final permission to a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to underwrite corporate debt, the first time the agency has granted that power to a commercial bank. In January, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> authorized <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> and four other large banks to expand their securities underwriting, but withheld final approval until it could review the management and financing of the banks' securities subsidiaries. That approval was given to <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> is the first to get the final nod. The others with pending applications are <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Banks for some time have had the power to buy and sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government securities and to underwrite and deal in general obligation municipal bonds In January, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> ruled that banks could also underwrite corporate debt provided that the activity did not generate more than 5 percent of all securities income. Corporate debt underwriting within that limit will not violate the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial from investment banking, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> ruled. The agency is expected to decide early next year whether banks can engage in limited underwriting of corporate stock.

<HEAD>Analysts Look to Delaware Court For Key Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Speculation is growing that the courts may be the next key arena in the fight for control of media giant <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Time's stock price fell again Monday following the company's rejection last week of a $ 10.7 billion takeover bid by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and its announcement of its own $ 14 billion, $ 70-a-share tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> In trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 5.62 -LCB- a share to close at $ 156.87 -LCB-. It declined $ 9 a share Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> rose 37 -LCB- cents a share to hit $ 59.62 -LCB-, and was the most active <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> issue. Paramount shares gained $ 2.37 -LCB- a share to close at $ 60.50. Either deal would create one of the world's largest entertainment and media concerns, ensuring that an American company would be among the global communications giants in the 1990s. Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> announced in March that they planned to merge in a stock swap transaction and amended that deal Friday to provide that <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> would offer $ 70-a-share for half of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s 200 million shares followed by a merger in which Time would pay $ 70 in cash and securities for the rest. Paramount has vowed to press ahead with its efforts to acquire Time. Securities analysts said they expect Paramount to ask the <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where all three companies are incorporated, for a decision on the legality of the Time offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. `` The game is n't over yet,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> McAlpine </PERSON>, a media analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Clearly, the court is the next issue.'' Analysts expect Paramount will ask the court to determine whether <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> put itself up for sale by agreeing to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> initially and whether <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> directors acted appropriately by agreeing to make the cash offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. Time has insisted it has not put itself up for sale, and that the cash offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> represented a revision of its original merger plan. Paramount has argued that Time has put itself up for sale, because <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> stockholders would have only had about a 40 percent interest in the merged company under the old plan. As a result, Paramount is expected to argue that Time should be subject to an auction _ including any Paramount bid. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>, who follows media stocks for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said his analysis indicated that stock in the resulting <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> combination would be valued by the market at about $ 173 a share. But he said the fact that <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> still was trading well below the $ 70-a-share offered price `` implies there is still a lot of speculation about all three stocks and about what will really happen.''

<HEAD>Computer Associates To Buy Cullinet For $320 Million In Stock</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The biggest is getting bigger with an agreement by <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to buy troubled <ORGANIZATION> Cullinet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 320 million in stock. <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> is the world's first independent software company to achieve $ 1 billion in annual revenue, while Cullinet has fallen on hard times and lost money each year since 1986. The companies announced a definitive merger agreement Monday, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said it expected to close the deal in August. Analysts said they expect <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> to follow its tradition of slashing jobs at new acquisitions, a possibly painful prospect for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullinane </PERSON>, the founder, chairman and biggest stockholder of Cullinet, which is based in <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` Cullinane is paternal. It was clearly not the first choice of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullinane </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> be the company that acquired it,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Federman </PERSON>, a partner of <ORGANIZATION> Broadview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, an investment banking firm in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> N.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> and Cullinet compete with each other and with <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in selling software for big mainframe computers made by <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> also sells software for smaller computers. <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> is headed by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, an aggressive executive who has built the company from an also-ran mainly by acquisitions and has promised to keep the company growing at 30 percent a year. Last year his company had revenue of $ 1.03 billion _ more than better-known software makers such as <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ and a profit of $ 163.5 million. `` The proposed merger will combine the talents, technology and resources of our two companies for the benefit of our clients, employees and shareholders,'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullinane </PERSON> founded Cullinet in 1968. He retired in September 1987 but came back in March 1988 as the company continued to falter. The company said Monday it lost $ 19.6 million last year on revenue of $ 202.9 million. <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> acquisitions have included <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 170 million last year and <ORGANIZATION> Uccel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 800 million in 1987. Cullinet, itself once the world's biggest independent software company, began to stumble when <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> targeted the mainframe data-base software business in 1985. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the department would have no immediate comment on the proposed transaction. The possibility that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> might block the acquisition on antitrust grounds apparently kept some speculators from buying Cullinet stock, <PERSON> Federman </PERSON> said. The stock sold Monday at a discount to the value implied by the <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> offer. <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> shares fell 75 cents to close at $ 19.50, while Cullinet rose 75 cents a share to $ 9 in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> issued a 2-for-1 stock split Friday. Shareholders of Cullinet will get half a share of <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> stock for each share of Cullinet they own. Based on Monday's closing price for <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, that amounts to $ 9.75 for each of the 33 million Cullinet shares outstanding. The transaction will be accounted for as a tax-free pooling of interests. <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> approached Cullinet about a merger last year but was rebuffed. Earlier this year, Cullinet hired <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to shop the company around, but apparently received no offers better than the one from <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 With two strikes against it, a dissident movement within the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union will try again, perhaps today, to make itself felt at the union's constitutional convention. The New Directions movement is proposing a resolution that would limit `` jointness'' in auto plants. The aim is to limit the growing practice of union and management joining together on a variety of projects inside and outside factories. It's a key issue for the strongest organized dissent in the 1 million member union in 40 years _ since the mid-1930s when <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reuther </PERSON> took the reins of the union. If the voting on the `` jointness'' issue goes the way of other New Directions-backed resolutions, the movement may strike out at the convention. However, its leader, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, has said there is more grass-roots support for the movement than what shows up at the convention. The forces of the Administration Caucus, led by <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON>, have easily put out any fires of dissent on the convention floor. While hard voting figures are not available because tallies are taken by a show of hands, New Directions has n't received support from more than 20 percent of the 2,000 delegates attending the convention On Monday, New Directions forces were turned back in an attempt to require rank-and-file elections for the union's top national officers, including the president, secretary-treasurer and vice presidents. Currently those offices are filled through voting by the delegates at constitutional conventions. <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> is expected to win a third three-year term in balloting Wednesday. Backers of the New Directions movement said a `` one-man, one-vote'' policy would make the union's leadership more accountable to the members. Administration Caucus members said nationwide campaigning would be too time consuming. Besides, they said, the system seems to be working now. But that did n't satisfy <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallett </PERSON> of Local 31 in <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION> `` They pay their union dues, they deserve the right to vote,'' he said from the floor during debate on the issue. But <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> of Local 600 in <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, reading from the convention's constitution committee report, said: `` A referendum is only the outer shell of democracy. The convention system delivers the substance.'' The effort was defeated on a show-of-hands vote. On Sunday, the first day of the week-long convention, delegates turned aside another New Directions move challenging the seating of several local delegations from regions covering eight south-central states and parts of metropolitan <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Also Monday, delegates heard a campaign-style speech by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, an unsuccessful candidate for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, in his first major speech since being elected majority leader of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> two weeks ago, sounded themes similar to ones he and others raised during last year's campaign. As he did during the campaign, he focused on the nation's trade deficit, saying the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has `` made some good sounds on trade.'' `` It remains to be seen if they are tough,'' he added. `` If not, we're going to have the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> amendment or something like it.'' The congressman from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> based a large part of his unsuccessful presidential campaign last year on trade issues. The legislation he proposed would have forced the president to take action against countries that traded unfairly with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` You can not compete against unfair competition,'' he said. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> also criticized the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, saying the nation needed to develop a comprehensive energy policy and to divert spending from military hardware to education and the fight against drugs. `` This is our time ... to make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> great and good and strong again,'' he said.

 The nation's largest maker of disposable diapers said today it will begin searching for ways to transform billions of dirty didies from an ecological problem into recycled flower pots, building insulation and lush highway medians. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced it is backing research to see if dirty disposable diapers can be cleaned and their components recycled. The cost of the program was not immediately available. In a statement issued prior to today's scheduled news conference at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, P & amp; G's associate director of research, said the company hoped to find ways of handling `` disposable diapers and other materials in municipal solid waste in ways that can bypass landfill disposal and recover valuable resources.'' The research, to be done in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and other states, comes as public concern is growing over the 16 billion disposable diapers dumped annually in the nation's overflowing landfills While not the biggest component in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> garbage pile _ waste paper, bottles and cans are bigger contributors _ diapers can not be recycled like other trash. Environmentalists have warned that the plastic-coated disposable diapers do not decompose, making their contents potential breeding grounds for dangerous viruses and bacteria that cause polio, hepatitis, meningitis and other diseases. As a result, lawmakers in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> have banned the sale of non-biodegradable diapers by 1993 and legislators in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> have considered similar action. The <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G announcement detailed three separate projects. The first, in cooperation with <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s Solid Waste Utility and <ORGANIZATION> Rabanco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, will collect used diapers from 1,000 households, wash and sanitize them, then separate them into plastic and pulp. The plastic will be recycled into flower pots, garbage bags and ersatz lumber used for landscaping. The pulp will be made into cardboard boxes, building insulation and wallboard liner. `` Our aim is not to get into the diaper recycling business,'' project director <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> said. `` Rather, we want to demonstrate that the technology is feasible and encourage entrepreneurs to get involved in this business.'' In another project with the recycling firm <ORGANIZATION> Recomp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of St. Cloud, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, diapers will be put through a process that churns garbage into a soil used to reclaim salt-tainted lands along highways. The diaper giant also will finance research at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> that, over the next five years, will bury and exhume regular and biodegradable disposable diapers at landfill sites in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the Northeast. This landfill archeology will see if products touted as biodegradable actually decompose any faster than the regular disposable diapers made by <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G. The stakes are high. P & amp; G owns a majority portion of the $ 3.5 billion disposable diaper industry. But that market share is being threatened by a growing environmental awareness and aggressive marketing by biodegradable diaper manufacturers and cloth diaper services.

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Gold Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar fell against most major foreign currencies in early European trading today. Gold prices were little changed. Currency dealers said the dollar's short-term trend is downward as a result of confusion created by last week's selloff. But they said the outlook for the longer term remains bullish as there's still underlying demand for dollars One trader in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> said the dollar-yen exchange rate has remained surprisingly stable because of continued strong demand for dollars out of the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, adding to the market's general confusion. He predicted that the dollar's downward correction could last one week, before bullish sentiments would take the upper hand again. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 1.70 yen to a closing 143.80 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 143.63 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.9708 West German marks, down from 1.9735; 1.7047 Swiss francs, up from 1.7045; 6.6810 French francs, down from 6.6940; 2.2205 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2351; 1,427.00 Italian lire, down from 1,439.75; and 1.1985 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1991 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $ 1.5575 to buy one pound, compared with $ 1.5485 late Monday. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price for gold of $ 366.50 an ounce at midmorning, unchanged from late Monday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 366.50 compared with $ 366.25 late Monday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose 93 cents to close at a bid $ 367.70. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 5.35 a troy ounce, down from Monday's $ 5.37.

<HEAD>Dollar Tumbles, Japanese Stocks Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar fell sharply against the Japaense yen today, while the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index rebounded. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 220.29 points, or 0.67 percent, finishing at 33,233.47. The dollar closed at 143.80 yen, down 1.70 yen from Monday's 145.50-yen finish It opened at 143.75 yen and moved between 143.25 yen and 144.00 yen. Traders said most investors were adjusting their dollar holdings, mainly because of uncertainties over the direction of the dollar-yen rate after large swings last week. The dollar closed Thursday at 151.30 yen, its highest in almost two years, and then fell 6.25 yen the next day. <PERSON> Yoshitsugu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanada </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> trader, said investors were buying dollars at the 143-yen level, while Japanese trading houses were selling as the dollar approached 144 yen. `` In mixed trading, the dollar has been gradually falling,'' <PERSON> Hamada </PERSON> said, adding that most investors no longer are looking for an abrupt rise against the yen. But this does not mean bullishness about the dollar has been totally reversed, he said. `` Now is the adjustment phase after the dollar's rapid rise to the 151-yen level last week,'' said <PERSON> Hamada </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> reportedly was selling dollars to support the yen, but the amount was not known. The central bank does not comment on its foreign exchange activities. On the stock exchange, dealers said the yen's surge against the dollar reassured Japanese investors, encouraging stock purchases. <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Masahiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Umemori </PERSON> said, `` The market rebounded by itself mainly because of recent stability in foreign exchange.'' `` It's too early to say the strong yen is back, but the foreign exchange's stability was at least good news for stock trading,'' he said, noting that the index had fallen more than 1,100 points last week because of the dollar's sharp rise against the yen. Trading, however, was still inactive due to lingering uncertainties over currency movements, <PERSON> Umemori </PERSON> said. Volume on the first section was estimated at 700 million shares, up from 450 million the previous day. Among gainers were electricals including <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, as well as steel and shipbuilding issuees.

<HEAD>London Shares Higher At Midday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices were firmer but below their intraday peaks at midday Tuesday after new British money supply data for May showed a higher-than-expected rise in bank and building society lending. Dealers said prices were still underpinned by some moderate futures-related buying and a general shortage of stock, which tended to push prices higher. The market also drew comfort from another steady performance by sterling, easing earlier fears that base lending rates would have to be lifted above the current 14 percent level to defend the currency, dealers said. Lending by banks and building societies rose by 6.7 billion pounds, or $ 10.4 billion, in May, higher than market expectations of around 5.9 billion pounds. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 16.4 points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,171.1 at midday. Volume was a moderate 321.5 million shares compared with 214.0 million shares at the same time Monday.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> says it has received approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to trade options on interest rates and will launch the new products on Friday. Exchange officials say options on interest rates will eliminate the inverse price-to-rate relationship associated with other <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> note markets and should appeal to individual investors. `` For the first time, there will be a product based on the level of interest rates themselves,'' <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said in a news release issued Monday. An option is a right to buy or sell a financial instrument or commodity at a specified price by a given date. Investors can use options to hedge their positions in cash markets or to speculate on market movements. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> is the world's largest options market. The exchange said in it will offer options on both short-term and long-term interest rates. The option on short-term rates will be based on the yield of the most recently auctioned 13-week Treasury bill. The option on long-term rates will be based on the average yield-to-maturity of the two most recently auctioned 7-and 10-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> notes and 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds. Unlike other interest-rate instruments, the price of these products is based on a composite that is calculated using interest-rate yields rather than the prices of bonds or bills. The prices of other interest-rate products move in the opposite direction from the products' yields. But with the new options on interest rates, prices will move in tandem with interest rates. The <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> also lists options on 201 widely traded stocks, on the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 100 and 500 stock indexes and on <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds and notes.

<TEXT>
 Analysts say <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> lined up a tidy deal to acquire the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 4 billion, but some believe a hostile bidder could mess it up. `` It's possible, but not likely,'' said <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, merchant banker who is part of the group that struck a $ 121-a-share takeover deal Monday with <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The proposed acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> faces a Sept. 18 deadline to complete the transaction. If the deal collapses, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> said, it would pay shareholders $ 70 cash a share in a special dividend under a recapitalization, which would cost about $ 2.1 billion. <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON>, an analyst for the brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, said the back-up plan could thwart a possible hostile tender offer for the nation's fourth-largest airline company because it would add unattractive debt to <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>. In other recent takeover battles, including the bidding war for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, hostile offers were submitted after the company announced an end to the bidding. <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> was ultimately purchased by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> takeover firm of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has long been rumored as a suitor for <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> has declined to comment on its intentions involving <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said hostile bidding will be deterred because it would take a substantially higher offer for <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> to justify the expense of reopening the auction, which spanned two months and included two rounds of bidding. Conceding as much, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> oil billionaire <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he tentatively supports the deal between <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>'s group, <ORGANIZATION> Wings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who owns 2.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s common shares, is one of three known suitors who were outbid by <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> The others were <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s 20,000-member Machinists' union. `` While disappointed by the outcome, I am pleased that the <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> special committee has elected to sell the company as we urged all along,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who noted he was dropping his tender offer of $ 2.7 billion, or $ 90 a share, which set off the bidding process. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying it was disappointed its bid was not chosen. The ailing carrier said that it wanted its offer to be reconsidered if the <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> bid falters, and that the <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> recapitalization would be worth less to shareholders than the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> bid. The airline has not disclosed the value of its offer. Northwest unions welcomed <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>'s bid. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> said its first choice would have been its own recapitalization offer. But `` we believe that <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> has a good history of operating, and is not just an asset stripper,'' said <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> contingent, which represents 21,000 mechanics, clerks, ticket agents and baggage handlers. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Siakel </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said, `` We like things he talks about, like a program for growth to strengthen the airline.'' <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> said it chose <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>'s offer because it contained the highest price, had the fewest contingencies and was the most likely to succeed. `` I think the likelihood of this deal going through looks rather high,'' <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON> said. `` It's certainly a fair price and it was at the high end of the ranges that people were using.'' <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> stock soared $ 6.50 a share Monday to close at $ 114.12 -LCB- on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>'s proposal includes $ 700 million equity and $ 3.35 billion to be borrowed from a syndicate of banks led by <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>'s equity partners include <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blum </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> merchant banking and investment firm; and <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of Elders <ORGANIZATION> IXL </ORGANIZATION>, an Australian investment company that counts a brewery among its holdings. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said he was not concerned about meeting financial fitness requirements of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> has said any leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> will be scrutinized to ensure that the carrier can operate safely in the face of large takeover debts. `` My feeling was that commercial banks are relatively conservative, so whatever level of debt they are comfortable with, everyone should be comfortable with,'' said <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>, 41. Significantly, <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>'s plan does not call for the use of high-yield, high-risk junk bonds, as do many takeover deals. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s unions said they would oppose a takeover involving this type of financing. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said his plan calls for `` substantial growth,'' including the purchase of 138 new planes already on order or option by <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>. He also said he would retain current management and keep <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in suburban <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said there would be no layoffs, nor would any Northest assets be sold. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Genoese </PERSON>, president of the airline division of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union, said he would meet with <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>'s group later this week. `` They want the company to grow,'' said Genoese, whose union represents about 7,000 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants and clerks. `` I'm for anyone that comes in that will make things grow and improve labor relations,'' <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said he also would meet with leaders of the 5,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> pilots union this week The pilots are negotiating a contract and have said they will strike if they do n't get a deal that offers competitive wages and job security.

 <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> will invest in a new subsidiary to expand the Belgian carrier and arm it against stiffer competition in a more deregulated European air traffic market in the 1990s. <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafelghem </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION> will have a 60 percent stake in the new subsidiary, called <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, with <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> each owning 20 percent. The new subsidiary must consolidate <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION>'s market share and help it turn the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> airport, <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION>'s home base, into a European hub, he said. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafelghem </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> will remain independent carriers, but he did not exclude further cooperation in air services in and out of <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> if `` such an arrangement is entirely compatible with <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> competition law.'' <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dekker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of operations, said the participation of the Dutch and British air carriers in the new subsidiary will run into `` billions of francs.'' He declined to be more specific. A billion francs is about $ 25 million. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION> increased its fleet and number of flights, especially in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, began a $ 10 million expansion program on air and ground services throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and also expanded services to the Far East. <PERSON> Dekker </PERSON> said the injection of <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> and British capital into the new subsidiary will allow <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION> to implement a quick expansion program to face stiffer competition as the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> moves to dismantle the Community's internal borders as of Dec. 31, 1992.

 <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION>, the Dutch airplane maker that is gaining a strong foothold in the competitive North American jetliner market, is in the final stages of negotiating a contract with <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for the purchase of 30 planes, a company spokesman said Tuesday. The value of the deal, which is awaiting approval by <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s board, was estimated at $ 679 million, according to industry sources here The deal, involving the sale of up to 30 fuel-efficient <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> F-100 short-haul jetliners, signaled another step in <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION>'s final breakthrough on the American market, said spokesman <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Veen </PERSON>. After teetering on the brink of bankruptcy because of huge research and development costs only 18 months ago, <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> now has firm orders for 218 F-100s, as well as 183 options. For its F-50 commuter propjet, <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> has 98 firm orders and 32 options, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Veen </PERSON> said. The Dutch airplane manufacturer made its biggest deal in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> so far earlier this year, when <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> bought 75 F-100s and took as many options. Other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customers are <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> was expected to deploy the new planes in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for its feeder network to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one of the airline's major European hubs, and for the shuttle services between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and West German cities, according to <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Veen </PERSON>. The latest contract will speed up <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION>'s search for a second assembly line in addition to the one at <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Schiphol </LOCATION> airport, which has a capacity of up to 48 planes a year, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Veen </PERSON> said. Although <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> is considering bids to open an assembly line in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where some commercial jetliner manufacturers are suffering from overcapacity, the company is believed to be under considerable Dutch government pressure to concentrate its production facilities in the <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> area for employment reasons. A final decision on that issue is expected in three to four weeks, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Veen </PERSON> said.

 After 18 months of delays, <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said today it has begun shipping its Release 3, an improved version of the best-selling 1-2-3 computer software. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manzi </PERSON>, the company's 37-year-old chairman, made the announcement at <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION>' annual meeting in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. With the embarrassing delays last year, `` Lotus and Release 3 had become the moral equivalent of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> in the World Series,'' <PERSON> Manzi </PERSON> said. `` We have come through a very tough period, and I believe we have proved our mettle,'' he said. A key feature of the new software is the ability to display data in three dimensions. Other computer spreadsheets show information along two axes, allowing, for example, a store manager who wants to analyze his seasonal sales pattern to put products along one axis and time periods along the other. If he has several stores, however, the manager faces an additional headache. With Release 3, he can cure it by creating a third axis, representing various stores or geographic regions. After three years and tens of millions of dollars in development costs, <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> is betting that 3-D software, unlike movies, will turn out to be more than a quick fad. Not everyone is sure. `` I think three dimensionality is a desirable function for a certain percentage of the market, but what percentage, I do n't know,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherlund </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` Not everyone needs it.'' Lotus, founded in 1982, has grown from a handful of employees to more than 2,600 worldwide on the strength of 1-2-3, its original product and still the source of nearly two-thirds of its sales, which are projected at more than $ 500 million this year. But to keep ahead of competitors like <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Redmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Borland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Scotts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> has had to continually upgrade the program's features. For the top-secret Release 3 project, which <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> code named `` Godiva,'' the firm three years ago assembled a small team of engineers that quickly grew to more than 100 people. A confident <PERSON> Manzi </PERSON> announced in April 1987 that Release 3 would be out in early 1988. But design and management problems, about which the company has said little, intervened. <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> said in February 1988 that Release 3 would not be ready until late in the second quarter of 1988. A month later, the target date was pushed back to the fourth quarter. Then, last October, the company announced a further delay, until the second quarter of 1989. With its repeated failure to meet its own deadlines, <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION>' earnings and stock price plunged, and its competitors picked up market share <PERSON> Manzi </PERSON>, a former management consultant who had taken over from <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapor </PERSON> in 1986, was stung by intensely personal negative publicity. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Digate </PERSON>, the executive in charge of spreadsheets, resigned. Industry wags said the company was pioneering a new class of products called `` vaporware'' _ software that disappears every time it is about to be introduced. But Lotus apparently turned the corner last year when it brought in <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> manager, to head up the project. He injected discipline into the project team and got Release 3 into field test in February. As a result, <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> stock has largely recovered, trading recently at around $ 26 a share, close to its 52-week high of $ 26.75 and far above its low for the year of $ 14.75. Competitors are still close on the firm's heels, with <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> steadily enhancing its Excel software, the No. 2 spreadsheet on the market, and <ORGANIZATION> Borland </ORGANIZATION> reportedly working on a 3-D version of its Quattro program. At <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION>' annual meeting today in the Berklee Performance Center attended by more than 400 people, the company showed a wide-screen television transmission from its manufacturing center in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> with boxes of Release 3 rolling off an assembly line and being packed for shipment to customers across the country. The delays have `` cost them a lot of clout in the market and tarnished their reputation,'' <PERSON> Sherlund </PERSON> said in advance of the announcement. `` Now it's their time to shine.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced today it will sell its <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> theme parks in four states and two other <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> attractions to help retire the huge debt it incurred in fighting off a 1987 hostile takeover attempt. The sale of the Sea World marine parks in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boardwalk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Baseball and <ORGANIZATION> Cypress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gardens </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is the only way <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION> `` can substantially reduce the company's obligations'' and make the necessary investments in its publishing and insurance divisions, a company statement said. In midmorning trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 3 a share to $ 13.12 -LCB- after the disclosure. The decision came about after recent talks between <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovanovich </PERSON>, and its new president, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caulo </PERSON>, according to the announcement The statement said <PERSON> Caulo </PERSON> `` is prepared to leave <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION> in order to manage these businesses under new ownership.'' The brief announcement made no mention of a possible buyer for the six parks, and a tract of land next to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION> directors have authorized this sale, which is subject to the approval of <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION>'s lenders,'' the statement said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Jovanovich </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Caulo </PERSON> have agreed that Mr. <PERSON> Caulo </PERSON> will direct the sale of these assets, whether made to a corporation or to a syndicate of investors.'' There was no further comment from the company. <PERSON> Jovanovich </PERSON> was unreachable for comment and <PERSON> Caulo </PERSON> did not immediately return telephone calls to his office. <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION>, a Fortune 500 company and the nation's largest textbook publisher, fought a hostile takeover by British publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> in 1987 by adopting a costly defense known as a recapitalization. It financed the plan by borrowing from banks and selling so-called junk bonds, ballooning its debt to $ 2.9 billion. <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 126.5 million, or $ 2.04 a share, last year compared with a 1987 profit of $ 64.4 million, or $ 1.34 a share. The loss came despite increased sales of 17 percent, to a record $ 1.78 billion, over 1987. The improved sales were caused by strong demand for <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION>'s textbooks and insurance policies, plus the opening of its new Sea World theme park near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tex. </LOCATION>, according to analysts During its first quarter, <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION> reported larger-than-usual losses in its publishing division. It lost $ 46.2 million in the first three months of the year, or nearly $ 19 million more than in the same period a year earlier. The company recently underwent a reshuffling of that division, relocating sales and marketing personnel and eliminating some 200 jobs.

 Three union leaders jailed for encouraging strikers to block mine entrances were freed today after promising to obey a judge's restrictions, raising hopes for an end to a wildcat walkout by 27,000 miners in nine states. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> officials said after leaving the judge's chambers that they can win their dispute against the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in spite of the judge's ban on tactics such as sit-down demonstrations to block coal trucks `` This strike is still building,'' said strike coordinator <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> as a cheering crowd of about 35 striking miners and family members waited outside the court of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. He and his two colleagues had been released from a <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION> jail Monday night pending today's hearing. `` There are no white flags on these hands. We're going to win this strike. We're not turning back,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said he and the other jailed leaders decided to purge themselves of a contempt charge and promised to obey the order because striking miners told them they were needed on picket lines. He also said the three were needed to testify for <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> supporters who were arrested in sit-down demonstrations. Also released were <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stump </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>'s southwest <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> district, and C.A. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a UMW international representative. The judge's June 5 decision to jail the three without bond until they promised to end civil disobedience against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> has been a rallying point for wildcat sympathy strikes by some 27,000 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members in nine states. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> field representative in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, said the unauthorized strikes probably will continue as miners turn their attention to the $ 3 million in fines levied against the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> by a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> state judge. `` What good is it to have them out of jail if they're going break the union anyway?'' <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> asked. The three leaders will be kept away from picket sites and instead be used at meetings in other communities, said <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> vice president. `` We are interested in satisfying him -LRB- the judge -RRB- that these people will obey his order,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> held the three on contempt of court for violating his order restricting strike activity. The sit-down demonstrations, in which more than 2,000 striking miners and supporters have been arrested, have since ended. Hours before the three were released from jail, the wildcat strike ended in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> when 790 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> employees returned to their jobs. But 5,000 more miners in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> joined the walkout. That brought to more than 27,000 the number of miners on strike against coal operators in nine states, not including the 1,800 picketing <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> in a contract dispute. The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> has about 80,000 active members nationwide. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Consolidation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, joined other coal company officials in criticizing the wildcatters. `` I do not know what the issues are except sympathy,'' he said. `` I think it's a very serious mistake by the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also said he feared the union members' actions would hurt exports. `` I think now we're going to have to live through being a not very stable supplier because of the wildcat strikes,'' he said. About 1,600 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> employees walked off their <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> jobs in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> on April 5 after working more than 14 months without a contract. The strike spread to <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> operations Monday, idling 200 more <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> has refused to sign a nationwide contract and wants its own pact that would include mandatory overtime, Sunday work and a cut in pension benefits. The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> insists that the company sign a contract requiring <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> to pay into the national pension fund and keep mines closed on Sundays. The wildcat strikers on Monday numbered 16,000 in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>; 3,900 in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>; 2,500 in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>; 1,750 in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>; 1,270 in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>; 1,100 in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; 650 in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>; 338 in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, and 200 in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>.

 Corn and soybean futures prices dropped substantially Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as wetter weather forecasts for the Corn Belt took the edge off drought fears.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A & amp; P and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment firm have joined in a $ 3 billion cash bid for <ORGANIZATION> Gateway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s third-largest food retailer, and Gateway has urged shareholders to accept it. Forged Monday night, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offer valued Gateway at $ 3.39 a share and would give 50-50 ownership of the company to <ORGANIZATION> Wasserstein </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perella </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and A & amp; P, which is the fourth-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food retailer. A & amp; P is 52.5 percent owned by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tengelmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The partners will put up a total of $ 780 million and borrow another $ 3.4 billion from banks and other sources. Some of the money will go toward refinancing more than $ 600 million of debt on Gateway's books. Gateway Chairman <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Monk </PERSON> would remain chairman under the deal, but <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> would take over as chief executive officer in addition to his current duties. Long outperformed by competitors, Gateway in April became the target of a $ 2.9 billion hostile bid from investor group <ORGANIZATION> Isosceles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium. Isosceles may find it hard to increase its already sweetened offer to beat the new one, analysts said. The consortium has effective control of about 27 percent of Gateway shares outstanding. The offer expires Thursday. Monk, who spent about $ 2.0 billion on takeovers between 1982 and 1986, transformed a struggling family-run wholesale food business known as <ORGANIZATION> Linfood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> into a big British retail holding company. Monk financed a number of acquisitions through stock offerings, doubling the company's shares outstanding and depressing its share price. Support among shareholders slipped further when he ran into difficulty digesting <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Carteret </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, acquired for $ 414 million in 1986. Gateway controls about 11.4 percent of the British grocery market. The company posted a 3.3 percent drop in pretax profit for the fiscal year ended April 30, 1988, the latest full-year results available. In a leveraged buy-out, a group of investors purchases a company from shareholders, largely with borrowed funds, then repays the debt through normal operations and asset sales.

<HEAD>IBM Is First To Announce Personal Computer With Next-Generation Chip</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> scored a public-relations victory Tuesday by becoming the first company to announce a personal computer containing the next-generation microchip from <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The computer will not be entirely new, and it will not be available until the end of the year, but analysts saw it as a psychological victory for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, which has been upstaged repeatedly by rival <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> must really have bugged them. They have gotten tired of <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> beating them to the market with the latest chip or the fastest chip,'' said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Seybold </PERSON>, publisher of Seybold Reports in <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` This is a shot across the bow from <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, that's about it,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON>, editor of Computer Letter in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said it will sell a $ 3,995 circuit board containing <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION>'s new i486 chip The board will replace the microprocessor in one of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s Personal System-2 Model 70-A21 computers, making it run twice as fast as the fastest personal computers available today, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said. The circuit board will go on sale as soon as the chips are available from <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to be the final quarter of this year. The price of the computer they go into was cut to $ 8,995 from $ 11,295. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> said the announcement is unimportant because the computer the new chip will go into _ the Model 70-A21 _ lacks the memory capacity and room for add-on equipment that <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>'s own high-powered models have. The limitations mean the computer can not take full advantage of the new i486 chip's power for such jobs as computer-aided design and engineering. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> faulted <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> for announcing the product before it is ready. It is `` absolutely'' possible that <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> will begin delivering a computer based on the i486 chip before <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> does, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Swavely </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview. `` Who announces first really does n't matter a whole lot,'' <PERSON> Swavely </PERSON> said. In contrast, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Carberry </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for systems in the personal computer organization, said, `` I think we're very well positioned'' to be the first to deliver a computer based on the i486. The Model 70-A21 was selected as the first housing for the i486 chip because its design allows it to accept different microprocessors easily. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said other members of its PS-2 family would also be equipped with the new chip over time, although the upgrade will be more complex. Ever since <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> brought out the first 80386-based personal computer in 1986, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has been trying to catch up in unit shipments of those machines, which are the most powerful IBM-compatible ones currently on the market. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> may hit No. 1 in the segment in the current April-June quarter, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distribution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview Tuesday. Analysts said that regardless of the technological significance of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement, they admired the competitive zeal <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> was displaying. `` I think it's a very clever idea,'' <PERSON> Seybold </PERSON> said. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> tried to steal some thunder from another rival, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, by announcing new products that allow people to use their personal computers as editing stations for video and sound. The hardware makes it possible for people to produce multimedia presentations on their desktop, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Silver Drops As Dollar Gains, Inflation Fears Wane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Silver futures prices slid about 9 cents an ounce Tuesday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the dollar strengthened and other commodity prices fell, easing inflation fears. Gold futures prices also dropped. On other markets, grain and soybean futures fell, energy futures were mixed, and livestock and meat prices were mixed. Silver settled 9 cents to 9.1 cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 5.25 a troy ounce; gold was 70 cents to $ 1 lower with August at $ 369.60 a troy ounce. Precious metals prices had been on the upswing, rising in five of the six previous sessions on perceptions that inflation was gathering steam. Precious metals are considered a safe investment in times of rising prices. Inflation worries had intensified after sharp increases in most commodity futures prices on Monday, and many precious-metals traders expected the rally to continue Tuesday. Instead, most commodity prices opened steady or lower. The dollar began the day on a weak note, which supported the precious metals early in the session, but it turned sharply higher by the end of the day and became a major negative influence on the metals. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said precious-metals traders will continue to watch the dollar for direction. `` If we see continued dollar strength over the summer, I think the metals will have no other option but to go lower,'' he said. Metals broker <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said further selling was prompted by the July silver contract's inability to push above $ 5.39 an ounce, the previous day's high July silver topped out at $ 5.38 on its third rally attempt, and many traders then gave up and sold the market, <PERSON> Rothman </PERSON> said. Corn and soybean futures prices dropped on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as wetter weather forecasts for the Corn Belt took the edge off drought fears. Wheat futures also retreated. The corn and soybean markets lost about half of the ground they gained Monday, when the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> looked to be due for an extended spell of hot, dry weather. But Tuesday's forecasts predicted rain in the northern and western Corn Belt by the end of this week, and selling pressure was strong from the opening bell. Wheat settled unchanged to 2 \ cents lower with July at $ 3.95 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 2 -RCB- cents to 5 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 2.66 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 4 cents lower with July at $ 1.68 \ a bushel; soybeans were 8 -LCB- cents to 12 \ cents lower with July at $ 7.36 The July crude-oil contract expired with a $ 1.33 loss at $ 19.53 a barrel after a volatile trading session that saw the price whipsaw from $ 19.02 to $ 21.30 a barrel. Experts said the wild action on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> signified no new supply-and-demand developments and was solely a function of the contract's expiration. Other West Texas Intermediate crude-oil contracts settled 8 cents lower to 4 cents higher with August at $ 18.88 a barrel; heating oil was .35 cent to .45 cent lower with July at 45.69 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .17 cent to .48 cent higher with July at 59.17 cents a gallon. Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in a session featuring profit-taking after Monday's sharp runup. Live cattle settled .28 cent lower to .75 cent higher with June at 73.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent to .47 cent lower with August at 81.35 cents a pound; live hogs were .55 cent lower to .18 cent higher with June at 49.15 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent lower to .67 cent higher with July at 34.50 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
 Crude oil prices plunged more than $ 1 a barrel in thin trading Tuesday while other petroleum products ended mixed. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the July contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, finished $ 1.33 lower at $ 19.53 a barrel, after gaining 91 cents on Monday. Other contract months were mixed. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, attributed the sell-off in crude to the fact that the near-month contract was set to expire on Tuesday. He noted that prices started out sharply higher, with the July contract up as much as $ 21.30 a barrel, but that they plunged later in the session as demand fizzled. `` There really were no fundamental reasons'' for the decline, <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON> said. The drop in crude helped pull down heating oil. The July contract for wholesale No. 2 heating oil slipped 0.37 cent to 45.69 cents a gallon, after settling 0.86 cent higher on Monday. Among other refined petroleum products, unleaded gasoline for July delivery rose 0.17 cent to 59.17 cents a gallon. The contract was up 0.86 cent the previous session.

<HEAD>Lotus Ships Long-Awaited Release 3 Spreadsheet Software</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After an 18-month delay that drove down its stock and depressed its earnings, <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it has begun shipping an improved version of its best-selling 1-2-3 computer software. More than 400 stockholders burst into cheers at <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION>' annual meeting as a live video hookup showed boxes of the long-awaited spreadsheet program, named Release 3, rolling off an assembly line at the company's <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> manufacturing center. With that triumph behind him, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Manzi </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION>' 37-year-old chairman, was able to talk about the embarrassing delays with humor. `` Lotus and Release 3 had become the moral equivalent of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> in the World Series,'' he said. `` ... We have come through a very tough period, and I believe we have proved our mettle.'' <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lotzgesell </PERSON>, an analyst with the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> brokerage house of <PERSON> Ragen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackenzie </PERSON>, said the delay in producing Release 3 was a boon to competitors like <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Redmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Borland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Scotts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Lotus, founded in 1982, once had a near lock on the $ 600 million-a-year market for computer spreadsheets Now, <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>'s Excel program has about 12 percent of the market, <ORGANIZATION> Borland </ORGANIZATION>'s Quattro has between 5 and 10 percent, and various other programs have about 10 percent, <PERSON> Lotzgesell </PERSON> said `` Wih people waiting and waiting and waiting -LRB- for Release 3 -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> did lose customers,'' she said. `` Now they may win some back.'' Release 3 originally was due out in early 1988. When <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> delayed its arrival three times, reportedly because of problems transferring the basic machine code into the computer language `` C,'' many analysts cut their 1989 earnings projections by 20 percent or more. <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> stock also plunged, although it has since bounced back to about $ 26 a share from a 52-week low of $ 14.75. Now, said analyst <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherlund </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the question is whether Release 3 can recapture the momentum for <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION>, which has 2,600 employees and reported sales of $ 468.5 million last year. One of the key advantages of Release 3 is the ability to display data in three dimensions, showing a row of up to 256 spreadsheets. But that ability makes the program something of a memory hog; to run it efficiently, a computer must have the latest generation of <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> 286 or 386 microchips and more than 1 megabyte of random access memory. Release 2.2, a version for less powerful, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> XT - and PC-compatible machines, is due out later this year Other versions, including one rich in graphics and one for Apple Macintosh computers, also are planned. <PERSON> Manzi </PERSON>, who took over from <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapor </PERSON> in 1986, endured harsh criticism for the company's delays and for his compensation, which totaled more than $ 26 million in 1987. But on Tuesday, he was clearly enjoying himself. Thanking the team of more than 100 engineers and programmers who produced Release 3, he told stockholders that `` These people have shown unbelievable dedication, unbelievable skill, and an equally unbelievable ability to eat cold pizza late at night.''

<HEAD>Survey Says Shrinking Youth Population Changing Consumer Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A decline in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s young adult population will be accompanied by a rise in average household income so the age group's buying power will hold steady, a research group said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the pool of young people will shrink significantly as the 20th century comes to a close due to a slowdown in the birth rate that began in the 1960s. The number of people between the ages of 20 and 35 will fall by about 10 million during the next 15 years from about 63 million in 1985, forecasts say. <PERSON> Fabian </PERSON> <PERSON> Linden </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s consumer research center, said over the past decade and a half young people have been the biggest growth segment of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer market `` But in the years ahead they will hold considerably less promise for marketers of a wide variety of products and services,'' <PERSON> Linden </PERSON> said. He estimated that currently one out of every four dollars of total household income flows to homes headed by persons under 35 years old. The amount is expected to fall to less than one dollar out of every five by the year 2000. However, the real buying power of this age group is n't expected to contract. `` The increase in average household earnings over the next decade will offset the decline in the number of households,'' <PERSON> Linden </PERSON> said. `` Additionally, because there will be fewer available American workers between the ages of 20 and 35, they will likely receive higher pay.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is a nonprofit research-oriented group supported by businesses, trade and professional organizations, government agencies, unions and others.

 The dollar gained against major foreign currencies in domestic dealings Tuesday after a mixed performance abroad. Gold prices posted minor changes. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 365 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m. EDT, $ 1 lower than Monday's late bid.

 The stock market finished lower Tuesday in dull trading. What little action there was came from stocks of companies involved in takeovers.

 A federal judge Tuesday approved an unprecedented civil securities fraud settlement between the government and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, placing the Wall Street firm under strict supervision and barring it from dealing with its former junk bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. Approval of the pact by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> cleared the way for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a record $ 650 million in order to settle separate criminal charges with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The civil settlement was reached in April but was held up by legal challenges from <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s attorneys that reached the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> alleged <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> had a conflict of interest and should have been removed from the case. In a brief hearing at federal court in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> said that after `` careful study'' he granted the joint request by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to approve the proposed settlement. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> charged <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> last fall with insider trading and other securities frauds involving more than 20 takeovers and other investment deals between 1984 and 1986. Under its settlement, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> neither admitted nor denied having committed the alleged crimes. The settlement does not include separate civil charges by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> against <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, the former head of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s junk bond division who resigned from the firm last week. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> also has been indicted on criminal fraud and racketeering charges stemming from his activities at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. `` This settlement will bring to a close 2 -LCB- difficult years for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, its employees and its clients,'' <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Curnin </PERSON> said in court. <PERSON> Curnin </PERSON> said approval of the pact would allow <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> `` to go forward and devote its time and energies to the service of its clients.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s chief litigation counsel in the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> case, asked <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> to approve the settlement quickly so <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> could adopt the settlement provisions designed to `` protect investors'' and continue to cooperate with the government. `` This cooperation is essential not only to the commission's ongoing investigations but to investigations being conducted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> attorney,'' <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON> said The settlement requires <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to overhaul its securities law compliance operations, top management and some trading departments and to submit to three years of close <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> scrutiny. It does not take effect until the criminal plea bargain with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is approved. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Kimba </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> now is expected to begin considering the deal reached in December over the criminal case against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> by the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> atttorney's office. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> pact, though, marks another milestone in the government's three-year investigation of white-collar corruption on Wall Street that began with former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> and led to arbitrager <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who paid $ 100 million to settle civil insider trading charges with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> in late 1986 <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s confessions led the government to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, which agreed to settle partly because of the possibility of a broad racketeering indictment that could have put the nation's fifth-largest securities firm out of business. Approval of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> pact, which was hammered out during three months of negotiations, was delayed because of challenges by <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employee who also faces criminal and civil charges. The <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION> argued that <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> should be removed from the case because of an alleged conflict of interest in which his wife stood to profit from a buyout <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> helped to finance. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> fought the assignment of <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> from the time the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> brought its sweeping civil case last September. <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> refused to step down and the 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld his decision. But the appeals court issued a stay preventing <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> from taking any action in the case so that the <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION> could ask for a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing. Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to consider the case. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> settlement also required <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to fire <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and bar its employees from doing business with him or any clients he is advising. Lawyers for <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> had been expected to mount a further challenge on the basis that the provisions were unconstitutional. But with <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s resignation from the firm, the move was deemed unnecessary, lawyers said. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s attorneys attended Tuesday's hearing but made no comment. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> still is challenging the criminal settlement between <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on the grounds it unfairly requires <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to withhold his 1988 compensation of more than $ 100 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION> were named March 29 in a 98-count fraud and racketeering indictment handed seeking more than $ 3.7 billion in forfeitures. They have pleaded innocent to the charges. Trial is set to begin in March 1990.

 A government prosecutor charged Tuesday that officials of <ORGANIZATION> Princeton-Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> illegally bought and sold stocks in a widespread tax fraud scheme amounting to `` plain, old-fashioned cheating.'' In opening arguments in the first racketeering case ever involving securities trading, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said the six defendants engaged in a `` very simple criminal scheme'' between 1984 and 1986 to generate phony tax losses. He also said prosecutors would play incriminating tapes in court, one of which includes a <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> trader telling a Princeton-Newport partner, `` Welcome to the world of being a sleaze.'' `` This is a case about cheating,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said in a packed courtroom at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` These defendants are wealthy, successful men, men who decided they were above the law, who decided they could break the law without being caught.'' On trial are five officials of the defunct investment partnership and former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> trader <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON>. The case overlaps the government's indictment of former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. Neither of the firms is on trial. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> alleged that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> via <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> purchased stocks from Princeton-Newport, then sold them back a short time later to create bogus losses that <PERSON> Princeton-Newport </PERSON> declared as tax deductions. The indictment in the case, handed up last August, alleged $ 13 million in bogus tax losses. Moving his left hand up and down, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> equated the alleged illegal trades with the motion of a yo-yo. `` These sales were on a string,'' he said. `` When the Princeton-Newport defendants sent those securities out, they sent them out waiting for the moment when they could bring them back with a little tug of the hand.'' `` When Princeton-Newport defendants went to the government and took that tax deduction, that was a fraud,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> added. But <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, attorney for Princeton-Newport managing partner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, said the tax trades were `` appropriate, proper and lawful'' and made in response to changes in federal tax laws in June 1984. `` Each loss involved in this case is a real loss,'' he said. In another alleged scheme, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON>, with the help of the Princeton-Newport defendants, illegally drove down the stock price of <ORGANIZATION> C.O.M.B. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 before a <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> offering of $ 25 million in bonds to the Minneapolis-based merchandiser. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> did not explain the motivation for the alleged scheme. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> also told the jury of nine women and three men that the alleged bogus stock `` parking'' trades also involved <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Akroyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Smithers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. Those two firms cooperated with the government. They were not charged. In an illegal `` parking'' deal, one party agrees to purchase a block of stock under an agreement to sell it back at a prearranged time and price, usually to skirt federal tax or stock ownership disclosure laws. In addition to <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, on trial are <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarzecki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkman </PERSON>, all partners in the investment firm; and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smotorick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Princeton-Newport </PERSON>'s comptroller <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said prosecutors would play tapes of conversations between <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Princeton-Newport </LOCATION> employees discussing the alleged illegal deals. The tapes, made as part of normal Princeton-Newport business activities, were seized during a raid on the firm's headquarters in December 1987 <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said one tape contains <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> telling <PERSON> Zarzecki </PERSON> after the latter made a C.O.M.B transaction in April 1985: `` You're a sleaze-bag.'' `` You taught me, man,'' <PERSON> Zarzecki </PERSON> is said to reply on the tape. `` Welcome to the world of being a sleaze,'' <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> said, according to <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>. Much of the evidence in the <LOCATION> Princeton-Newport </LOCATION> case also is expected to be used against <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, the former head of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s junk bond department, who was charged in March in a separate 98-count racketeering indictment. <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> also is charged in that case. The charges against <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> include dealings he allegedly had with Princeton-Newport, which was based in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and went out of business shortly after its officials were indicted last August. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> conceded that none of the defendants made any money in the alleged illegal deals, but attributed that to accountants' errors. He said that fact did not exonerate the men. The Princeton-Newport trial is the first in which the racketeering statute, which carries heavy sentences, fines and forfeiture of alleged illicit profits upon conviction, has been used against officials of a securities firm.

 <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest poultry processor, pressed its attempt Tuesday to take over <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by raising a tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> stock to $ 70 a share, a bid worth more than $ 1.2 billion. Tyson of <LOCATION> Springdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, has been trying to take over <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> since last October, and the Memphis-based <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> has been struggling since November to merge with <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. `` We are delighted that <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> has now decided to raise its bid,'' <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Nachbar </PERSON> said in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that has refereed the <LOCATION> Tyson-Holly-ConAgra </LOCATION> squabble. `` We do expect the <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> board to meet within the next five business days to consider the proposal,'' <PERSON> Nachbar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> urged its 5,500 shareholders to hold on to their 18.1 million shares until the company's board meets to review the latest Tyson bid. In raising its tender offer from $ 63.50, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> also said its new bid was no longer conditioned on removal of an asset sales agreement established late last year between <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>. That agreement is at the heart of a legal fight launched by <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>. The latest merger proposal for <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> was announced May 20 and is based on a stock swap, while <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s bid is for cash. <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> expect to call shareholder votes next month on their proposed merger. When the proposal was announced, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> said it was worth $ 74 a share based on market prices at the time. The <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court has been told, however, that the offer likely would be worth around $ 68 a share by the time the agreement could be settled. In addition to raising its offer, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> also filed a court petition Tuesday seeking to force <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> to dissolve a shareholder rights plan containing a `` poison pill'' aimed at making a takeover more costly for an aggressor. Vice Chancellor <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON> rejected a similar <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> attack on that plan June 14 while clearing the way for shareholder votes on the proposed merger. The shareholder rights plan, adopted in October, would give <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> stockholders a price break on additional shares in the event of a takeover. The battle for <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> began last year when <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> offered a deal valued at $ 49.50 a share through a cash and stock swap. <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> managers rejected that offer as insufficient and have pointed out several times during the ensuing takeover attempt that their resistance has raised the amount of money their stockholders will make if the company is sold. <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>'s original merger offer called for swapping 1.875 shares of <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> stock for each <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> share traded. The current proposal calls for a swap of 2.1 shares. Tyson Foods processes 16.5 million chickens a week and has announced expansion plans to push that to 17.5 million by the end of next month. <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> is a diversified company heavily involved in fresh chicken sales. <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> is a diversified company specializing in food and agricultural services.

<HEAD>Milken Heads Magazine's List Of Highest 1988 Earners On Wall Street</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Indicted financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> was the highest paid Wall Street professional in 1988, earning more than $ 180 million as part-time junk bond chieftain for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, according to estimates compiled by Financial World magazine. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s earnings combined with the 1988 income of the rest of Wall Street's top 10 earners totaled nearly $ 1 billion, exceeding the gross national product of some small countries, Financial World said Tuesday in releasing its `` Wall Street 100'' list to be published in its July 11 edition. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> was one of two executives in the top 10 _ along with <ORGANIZATION> Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON> _ indicted or convicted this year for securities laws violations <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>, the takeover strategist who was convicted June 9 for securities fraud unrelated to his 1986 takeover of Singer, was sixth on the list with estimated earnings of at least $ 80 million last year. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cain </PERSON>, chairman of the petrochemical concern <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, was second on the list with $ 120 million. No. 3 was <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>, partner in the leveraged buyout firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, who earned `` at least'' $ 110 million, the magazine stated. Financial World said its estimates were based on more than three months of research of company documents and interviews of company sources. Together, the 100 highest paid people on Wall Street earned $ 2.5 billion last year, the magazine said. Rounding out the top 10 were <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> partner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, with $ 110 million; investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>, of the Bass brothers of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, more than $ 100 million; <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, the investor who heads conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Minstar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, more than $ 75 million; <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> David-Weill </PERSON>, top partner of the investment bank <ORGANIZATION> Lazard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, more than $ 65 million; <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, chairman of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, at least $ 50 million; and investor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainwater </PERSON>, more than $ 50 million. Last year's No. 1, commodities trader <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Tudor </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> II, fell to number 19 as his earnings dropped from an estimated $ 80 million to about $ 30 million, the magazine stated. Financial World said 1988's takeover frenzy helped enrich most of those on the 100 list. The lowest earner was <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Connors </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> salesman of preferred stock for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, whose estimated income was $ 7 million. This year's median earner made $ 15 million, the magazine said. That was triple last year's $ 5 million median _ but only about as much as <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> earned in a month.

 <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> put its four Sea World parks and two other attractions on the market Tuesday to help extricate itself from a $ 2.5 billion debt brought on by a 1987 hostile takeover attempt. The company said selling the marine parks in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boardwalk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Baseball and <ORGANIZATION> Cypress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gardens </ORGANIZATION> in central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> was the best way to meet debt obligations and concentrate on its publishing and insurance divisions. Estimates of the value of the properties ranged from $ 1 billion to $ 2.5 billion. Wall Street applauded the move. <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION>'s stock closed up $ 3.75 a share Tuesday to $ 13.87 -LCB- in active trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a positive development for the company because of its weak balance sheet,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON>, a securities analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Clearly, something had to be done.'' <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bramwell </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm <ORGANIZATION> Gabelli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION> `` should n't have been doing all these -LRB- other -RRB- things. The first love of this company is publishing.'' <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest textbook publisher, has struggled with a $ 2.9 billion recapitalization program over the past two years by disposing of trade-magazine and school-supply interests, streamlining its parks division and reshuffling its publishing operations _ all of which included huge reductions in personnel. <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION> restructured its operations, through bank loans and high-risk junk bonds, to fend off a hostile takeover attempt by British publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> in 1987. The decision to sell the theme parks and real estate holdings followed recent talks between <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION>'s longtime chairman, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovanovich </PERSON>, and the company's new president, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caulo </PERSON>, according to a three-paragraph statement by <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION> directors have authorized this sale, which is subject to the approval of <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION>'s lenders,'' the announcement said. It added that <PERSON> Caulo </PERSON> `` is prepared to leave <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION> in order to manage these businesses under new ownership.'' The parks will be sold as a package to an investor that `` wants to invest in them and continue to see them grow,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Evanson </PERSON>, head of the theme parks division, said in an interview. <PERSON> Evanson </PERSON> said the company had spoken to `` quite a few'' potential buyers of the parks, which brought in an estimated $ 388 million in revenue last year, and a separate tract of land near <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Among the possible buyers mentioned by analysts, however, were: <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <LOCATION> Busch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>; British entertainment magnate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>, who has restaurant and nightclub properties in the area; <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>, which reportedly is interested in <ORGANIZATION> Boardwalk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Baseball; and the prosperous <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which just opened its third theme park in the <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> area. <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION>'s trade-magazine and school-supply operations were sold to <ORGANIZATION> Edgell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 334 million in late 1987. That was the beginning of the effort to repay some of the debt associated with the costly takeover defense. <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 126.5 million last year compared with a 1987 profit of $ 64.4 million, or $ 1.34 a share. The company paid about $ 313 million in interest last year.

 <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, pursuing <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> with a a $ 10.7 billion takeover bid, has asked federal regulators to set aside rulings allowing Time to transfer control of its cable TV systems to the company <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> wants to create by buying <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, argued that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s plans for creating a voting trust to take temporary custody of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> stock violates cable laws that give local authorities the right to approve transfers of cable licenses The filings at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> were the latest round in the manueverings over whether <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> can acquire Time or whether <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> buys <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> in deals that would create the world's largest entertainment and media conglomerate. Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> said in documents filed with the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> had misrepresented to Time stockholders the nature of the transfer of control. Paramount also said Time had written to state attorneys general asking them to oppose <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal without notifying Paramount of the letters. These actions `` raise substantial and material questions about Time's character qualifications,'' <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> said in asking the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to set aside its previous approval of the license transfers pending an <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> investigation. Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> announced in March they had agreed to merge in a stock swap, and proceeded to secure appropriate regulatory clearances. Paramount launched its hostile bid for Time on June 6, just 17 days before <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shareholders were to have voted on the merger. Time rejected <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s offer and revised its merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> to call for a $ 14 billion tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. The battle is expected to be waged in court in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where all three companies are incorporated. Paramount earlier this month asked the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> for permission to deposit any <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> shares it may acquire in a voting trust that would be headed by former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON> pending <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> approval of the transfer of 99 cable television franchises and licenses held by <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s 82-percent-owned subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Harding </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s request `` would violate the recent cable act because <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON> has n't gotten consent from any of these cities for the transfers. <PERSON> Harding </PERSON>, echoing assertions Time made in a June 13 filing with the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s plan would `` undermine the delicate balance'' established in the 1984 Cable Act for regulation of cable systems by local authorities. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> late Monday to deny the application made by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> for expedited consent for the trust arrangement for temporary custody of any Time shares that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> acquires. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s plan called for an `` unprecedented extension'' to the cable TV industry of <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> rules that cover hostile tender offers for broadcast licenses. `` Such an extension of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> tender offer policy would emasculate the significant role in cable franchising mandated for local authorities by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> also said, among other things, that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s plan was faulty because <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON> was being paid $ 250,000 and thus was not an independent trustee; that a voting trust was invalid because <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s cable systems were affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s Madison Square Garden and <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> networks; and that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> might end up owning TV and cable systems in the same region in violation of federal cross-ownership regulations `` Paramount's so-called tender offer is so riddled with conditions, loopholes and escape hatches as to be essentially illusory,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, who would become the new deposit insurance czar under legislation moving through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, is talking to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> about an idea that would enhance his power over the savings and loan bailout <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> is angling for greater authority over the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a new entity that will be created to close or merge insolvent savings and loan institutions and dispose of real estate repossessed by the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, said a well-informed industry official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> chairman is said to be proposing that his own organization's board, rather than a single person, be appointed chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, in a telephone interview Tuesday, declined to say his agency is advocating the idea, but he described it as `` worth exploring'' and `` feasible. `` It's not our idea. It came from a suggestion that the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the congressional <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- made. We have been talking to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> about it,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, under legislation that passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last week and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in April, will have the mammoth task of spending $ 50 billion in new bailout funds and of handling $ 300 billion to $ 500 billion of bad loans and property. The legislation does not spell out how the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will be structured beyond the composition of its board, which will be headed by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary, and the fact that it must hire a chief executive officer. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> is getting the job of insuring savings and loan deposits, in addition to the commercial bank deposits it already guarantees. However, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s relationship to the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is left unclear. Treasury officials have said they envision the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as an oversight agency, with fewer than 100 employees, which would hire others to do its work. Presumably, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, because it has already taken over the 221 <ORGANIZATION> worst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls and has the largest pool of experienced real estate liquidators in the government, would be the biggest contractor, with private firms also getting pieces of the work. However, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> has said he does not want his agency to get expanded responsibility without added authority to control the conditions and terms under which it does the additional work. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said if the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> were not given the added authority, and were simply a contractor of the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, it would want to pick and choose what S & amp; L liquidation work it wanted. `` We can contract to do what we think is good for -LRB- our -RRB- agency to do and we would n't have responsibility for the overall operation. We would contract to do such jobs as were attractive to both sides,'' he said. However, that would probably require the administration to make the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> a larger and more complex bureaucracy than it now wants. Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> said the administration has planned all along for the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> to take the lead role in disposing of failed S & amp; Ls. At issue, he said, is the vigor of administration oversight. The administration sees the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer as a `` full-time oversight officer,'' he said. `` No one likes the idea of a full-time person overseeing them. But our view is we're required to have oversight,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> `` wants as much independence as -LRB- it -RRB- can get, but there's a limit as to what can be done on that.'' He said the administration is working to more precisely define the RTC-FDIC relationship in time for a definition to be included in <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L legislation, which is expected to be on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s desk by early August, following a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference and final congressional approval in July. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who owns an <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, real estate liquidation firm which has worked for the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, said there are two factions within the agency. One is composed of <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> veterans `` who do n't appear interested in taking on this enormous problem.'' The other faction, he said, consists of `` the future <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> Trumps of the world'' who want to expand the agency. `` I think <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> is with the young Turks,'' the industry official said.

<HEAD>Jurors Side With Jack Daniel's In Lemonade Mix Retrial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A retrial of a $ 13 million lawsuit over a <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>'s drink recipe for <ORGANIZATION> Lynchburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lemonade </ORGANIZATION> concluded Tuesday with a jury verdict in favor of the whiskeymaker's parent firm. Former <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> lounge owner <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> filed suit, claiming ownership of the recipe. But a <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury deliberated just 40 minutes before ruling in favor of <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and against <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> first sued over the <ORGANIZATION> Lynchburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lemonade </ORGANIZATION> recipe in 1983, but the first trial ended with the jury awarding him only $ 1 when the judge instructed the panel it could only consider nominal damages. An appeals court then ruled punitive damages could also be considered, setting the stage for this month's retrial. Jurors quickly left the courtroom after jury foreman <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> reported the verdict around 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, ending a week of testimony involving dozens of witnesses and more than 125 items submitted as evidence. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> contended a <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>'s salesman, <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Randle </PERSON>, visited his lounge in 1982 and promised him the company might use <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and his band in a promotion if it decided to use the recipe. Attorneys for <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Forman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Randle </PERSON> conceded <PERSON> Randle </PERSON> visited <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. But they said the version of <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s recipe that <PERSON> Randle </PERSON> received at <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION>'s nightclub and turned over to company officials called for the use of lemon juice instead of the sweet-and-sour mix used in <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>'s whisky promotions. The company argued that <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> did n't have a trade secret on the drink recipe anyway, because he did n't do much to protect the recipe other than inform employees `` not to tell anyone.'' But according to testimony, some 25 employees at <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION>'s lounge, including a dishwasher, knew the formula. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>'s claimed the final recipe for <ORGANIZATION> Lynchburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lemonade </ORGANIZATION> was a product of <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Bisio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasseter </PERSON>, a company `` mixologist.'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> left the courtroom without comment. His attorney, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON>, gave no indication of a further appeal. `` This is something we've worked on for six years and put a lot of hours and efforts in. I really believed in the case. I'm disappointed,'' <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON> said A top executive for <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Forman </PERSON>, the parent company of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>'s, which was among the original defendants, expressed delight at the verdict.

<HEAD>Religious Group Plans to Announce Advertiser Boycott Plans July 17</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A religious group that plans to target one or more advertisers for a boycott based on the television shows the companies sponsor said Tuesday they plan to announce their selection July 17. The group, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leaders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> or Clear-TV, said it is analyzing data collected during from the recent TV sweeps period to compose its list. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelicals </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the group, said the data was collected by about 3,000 people watching TV in 33 states. He said network advertisers were asked three times before the sweeps period, April 27 through May 24, to be responsible in the placement of their commercials by avoiding programs with gratuitous sex, violence, profanity and anti-Christian stereotyping. Some industry watchers say efforts in the early 1980s to boycott advertisers failed.

<HEAD>Crazy Eddie Files For Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EDISON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Crazy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the flamboyant electronics retailer, filed for protection from creditors Tuesday under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code but pledged to keep its stores open. Five creditors had filed a petition for involuntary bankruptcy against <PERSON> Crazy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> on June 6, seeking to recover $ 860,000. The company initially said it would fight to have the filing dismissed. But <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martosella </PERSON>, acting president and chief executive officer, said the petition caused a series of problems that forced <PERSON> Crazy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> to seek protection. `` The action of the five creditors, which we believe was ill advised, caused a disruption in our bank credit facility and related business and cash flow problems requiring the company to seek the protection afforded it under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code,'' he said in a statement. <PERSON> Martosella </PERSON> said the company had been negotiating an out-of-court debt restructuring with its creditors. `` We believe that the Crazy <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> name remains a strong consumer franchise,'' <PERSON> Martosella </PERSON> said. The filing, made in <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, will not affect operations at <ORGANIZATION> Crazy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eddie </ORGANIZATION>'s 26 stores in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, the company said. The retailer, known for its frenetic broadcast commercials and claims that `` Our prices are insane,'' closed 17 of its 43 stores in March in a bid to cut its losses. The company said it had been drained of its working capital by a drop in sales compounded by inventory shortages, long-term debt and unprofitable locations. In filing to force an involuntary bankruptcy reorganization, the five creditors claimed Crazy <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> was liquidating its assets without taking into account its debts. They also said negotiations on repayment had collapsed. The petition was filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Cobra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Dynasca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Phonemate </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Code-A-Phone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phones </ORGANIZATION>, an affiliate of <ORGANIZATION> U </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 Delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> convention turned aside Tuesday an attempt to limit joint labor-management programs at auto plants, dealing a dissident group its third major defeat in as many days. In a show-of-hands vote, delegates to the union's triennial constitutional convention rejected a move that would have forced the international union to support locals that oppose the team management style. The so-called jointness resolution is a cornerstone of the disagreement between the New Directions movement and the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s leadership The dissidents claim the joint programs endanger jobs and rob the union of its strength. The Administration Caucus, which represents the union's administration, contends that change in the workplace is necessary, and that New Directions supporters do n't recognize that. `` It makes me wonder where they -LRB- dissidents -RRB- have been in the last 15 years,'' delegate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> of Local 1895 in <LOCATION> Broken </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arrow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, area said during debate on the matter. But New Directions member <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, president of Local 909 in <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, said the joint programs represent a union-breaking strategy. `` I submit to you that jointness is their attempt to co-opt our union,'' he said. The joint labor-management programs grew out of the auto industry's slump in the early 1980s and the threat of foreign competition. The New Directions effort also suggested that the union abandon its seat on the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> board of directors, now held by union President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> bristled at the suggestion. `` It's a lonely place on that board ... but it's the only voice of the workers,'' he said. After the loss, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, the leader of the New Directions movement, said he thought the debate was worthwhile and that he hoped delegates would return to their locals and talk about the convention with the rank and file. `` The rank and file ultimately will find ways to express themselves,'' he said. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> declined to say exactly how or when that expression may come. He did say he expected there would be a New Directions presence at <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> prebargaining meetings next year. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s contracts with the Big Three automakers expire on Sept. 14, 1990 Before the debate, the third day of the convention got off to a loud start as a parade of dissidents marched into the hall, waving signs and shouting. It was the first organized demonstration during the convention by New Directions forces, the strongest voice opposing <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> leadership in 40 years. New Directions, which has about 20 percent of the delegates in its corner, lost votes on two other major issues it brought to the convention. One involved a credentials fight over certain delegates from <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> regions in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> and metropolitan <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. The other would have required that the union abandon its practice of electing top national officers at conventions and substitute for it a national referendum of the rank and file.

 Home Shopping Network lost $ 400 million in profits because its telephone equipment was inadequate to handle the volume of calls, an attorney said Tuesday. The hefty loss was suffered over a 14-month period as the St. Petersburg-based television retail giant went through a huge spurt of growth, <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamin </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION>, told a jury. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiaries knew about the problems _ that a staggering number of calls were not getting through _ but lied to the company and persuaded <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> instead to buy even more equipment to try to resolve the dilemma, he said. `` Home Shopping's like Mother's Day, every day,'' said <PERSON> Kamin </PERSON>, referring to the high number of calls from viewers who may only purchase items while they are being displayed on the screen. `` What happened as a result of <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> blocking calls and not telling us is that we lost millions and millions of calls,'' <PERSON> Kamin </PERSON> said in opening statements. A jury of five women and one man was seated Tuesday in a $ 1.5 billion battle between the corporate giants, <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> sued <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>, its parent <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and other subsidaries in 1987, alleging a number of misdeeds linked to what it claimed was inadequate service and faulty phone equipment <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> and its parent company, a multibillion-dollar telecommunications firm based in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, have denied any wrongdoing and said there was nothing wrong with their equipment. They filed a countersuit alleging slander and libel and claimed that <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> executives engaged in a `` blame the telephone company scheme to mask <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION>'s poor market and financial performance ...'' <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> told the jury that <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION>'s charges were `` absolutely baseless.'' <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> had 4 million subscribers when it talked to <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> about telephone service in 1985, <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> said. That grew to 9 million by August 1986, and one year later the number skyrocketed to 46.5 million, he said. Sales soared from $ 11 million in 1985 to $ 582 million by August 1987 _ all with the <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> telephone network in place, he said. `` We do n't believe you just cover your own problems of mismanagement ... by blaming other people. There was no fraud ... no coverup,'' <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION>'s original 12-count complaint has been reduced to four charges _ fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and confidence and breach of fiduciary duty. Pinellas Circuit Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rives </PERSON> combined both suits in what is expected to be a six-week trial. Although there are no phone company records showing the precise number of calls in question, Home Shopping expects to show evidence that 42 million calls were not completed betweeen February 1986 and April 1987, <PERSON> Kamin </PERSON> said. He added that not all lost calls would have translated into sales. <PERSON> Kamin </PERSON> presented what he said was an internal <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> memo that noted as many as 26,000 overflow calls in a one-hour period. The in-house document asks what are <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries responsibilities to the customer and the efficiency of his service, and notes that <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> `` is not aware that its calls are restricted.'' `` It was in a sense a disaster waiting to happen,'' <PERSON> Kamin </PERSON> told the six-member jury and five alternates. After April 1987 surveys showed <ORGANIZATION> HSN </ORGANIZATION> was losing 50 percent of its calls the company switched carriers to <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kamin </PERSON> said, adding the call completion rate now is over 90 percent.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar held firm against the Japanese yen Friday morning, while stock prices shed about half their early gains. The dollar was changing hands at 144.80 yen at late morning. After opening at 144.85 yen, up 1.05 yen from Tuesday's close of 143.80 yen, the currency ranged from 144.73 to 144.95 yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 220.29 points Tuesday, lost 56.05 points, or 0.16 percent, to finish the morning session at 33,177.42. The index gained 111.22 points during the early morning session. <PERSON> Kinji </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishizuka </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a major Japanese brokerage, said the market experienced `` strong buying at the start, but later weakening with many investors taking a wait-and-see position'' in the absence of major market-affecting news. `` The market is not now reacting too much even if exchange rates fluctuate at a margin of one yen or so,'' <PERSON> Ishizuka </PERSON> said. In the currency market, traders said the dollar was firm during the morning session following its overnight firmness in overseas markets. `` Investors still want to invest in dollar assets, but it fell so suddenly last week that they can not buy it up too aggressively,'' said a dealer of a major Japanese bank, who spoke anonymously. The dollar fluctuated wildly last week, with the currency closing Thursday at 151.30 yen, its highest level in almost two years. The dollar fell 6.25 yen Friday.
